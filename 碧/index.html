<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 3-11-2007(29): Notes: 珀 (not in Heisig) means "amber". Story for both: A bus is stopped at some traffic lights in Japan. Inside, <em>King</em> Henry VIII and Barry <em>White</em> are arguing over whether the lights are yellow or <em>amber</em>. The lights change to "Go", and Mick Jagger (<em>stone</em>) then joins a new argument over whether the lights are blue or green. They compromise on<strong> blue-green</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 11-11-2010(12): The rarest form of <em>amber</em> is a<strong> blue-green</strong> <em>stone</em>. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_amber">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_amber</a>).</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 11-8-2008(7): A 昔話 about why street lights in Japan are <em>blue-green</em>. In the old days, there was only one street light - and it was <em>amber</em>. When it was on, you had to stop - and when it was off, you could go (but slowly). So one day a salaryman was late for work and stuck at a long <em>amber</em> light. He got impatient and threw a <em>rock</em> at it. The light started to malfunction and flickered<strong> blue-green</strong>. People were confused - "what do we do? Stop? Go slowly?" "Uh..it means…go fast!!!" The end.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 6-8-2009(4): Notes: 珀 (not in Heisig) means "amber". (Thanks Katsuo) <strong>Amber</strong>: The <em>king</em> is above wearing <em>white</em>; all his clothes must be dyed a deep <strong>amber</strong> color to show how wealthy he is.<strong> Blue-green</strong>: To augment his <em>amber</em> robes, the king wears<strong> blue-green</strong> precious <em>stones</em> as jewelry.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 26-5-2008(3): There's only one occasion for which an <a href="../v4/261.html">emperor</a> (#261 皇) will take off his <em>white</em> tiara which distinguishes him from a mere <em>king</em>, and that is when he's offered a <strong>blue-green</strong> jade <em>stone</em>.</p>
