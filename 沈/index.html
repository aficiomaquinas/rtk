    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>The technique for <b>sinking</b> used in this kanji is unique. Rather than the biblical image of tying a millstone about the victim's neck, here we see a <i>crown</i> tied about one <i>leg</i> before the unfortunate party is tossed into the <i>water</i>.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jreaves">jreaves</a>] 20-7-2007(178): (thx geezer) The maimed waitress (no head and arms just her legs and trunk) is dropped into the water with a cement crown to make sure she<strong> sink</strong>s. She shouldn't have been so nosy about her yakuza-boyfriend's schemes.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 10-2-2007(87): This is the famous story of Archimedes and the Crown, where buoyancy was discovered. Watching the <em>crown</em><strong> sink</strong> in the <em>water</em>, Archimedes detected the fraud and ran naked through the city (<em>human legs</em> distorted from running) yelling "Eureka! Eureka!" See <a href="http://math.nyu.edu/">http://math.nyu.edu/</a>~crorres/Archimedes/Crown/CrownIntro.html and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_%28word%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_%28word%29</a>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 19-11-2007(57): A mob of peasants throws a noble into the <em>waters</em>, his <em>human legs</em> stuck into the <em>crown</em> he was wearing proudly just a minute before (this later image for the special primitive combo on the right). The poor guy<strong> sink</strong>s to his death, unable to swim back up. Sunk by his <em>crown</em>!</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 1-7-2007(23): The maimed waitress (no head and arms just her legs and trunk) is dropped into the water with a heavy crown to make sure she<strong> sink</strong>s.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 14-10-2009(13): If you're in the <em>water</em> and your <em>legs are squeezed together inside a tight crown</em> you won't be able to swim properly - you'll just<strong> sink</strong>.</p>
