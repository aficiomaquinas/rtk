1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 29-1-2007(16): A<strong> bumper crop</strong> is a very full crop. In this particular case, the<strong> bumper crop</strong> is a <em>wheat</em> crop, grown by this excentric guy in a <em>grass skirt</em>, who has gone completely native, but knows the secrets of how to get a good crop!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 7-8-2009(10): On the <em>tropical island of JOU</em>, lots of crops are grown - coconuts, bananas, pineapples, etc - but these are really just for show to get lots of tourists. The real<strong> bumper crop</strong> that feeds the islanders is <em>wheat</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 7-3-2009(8): The <em>hula girl</em> dances around the <em>wheat</em>, and this appeases the deities so they give them a<strong> bumper crop</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 21-12-2009(4): It was a<strong> bumper crop</strong> indeed the year we sewed <em>wheat</em> but reaped instead a field of beautiful women in <em>grass skirts</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wilsoncb">wilsoncb</a>] 27-8-2010(1): It&#039;s a<strong> bumper crop</strong>, and there&#039;s wheat to spare. Weave some into a grass skirt and celebrate!
