1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 2-2-2007(50): That <em>hole</em> is still too<strong> tight</strong>. Bring the <em>saw</em> to enlarge it!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 20-5-2009(13): I tried to <a href="../v4/1324">squeeze</a> (#1324 搾) my fingers through a <em>hole</em>. It did not work! But I was clever and amputated my fingers with the <em>saw</em>. However, it was still<strong> tight</strong>. But I am not stupid! Why not enlarging the <em>hole</em> with the <em>saw</em>? Wait! I should have done that first! Oh no...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 8-7-2009(6): Use a <em>saw</em> to enlarge a <em>hole</em> that&#039;s too<strong> tight</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 14-8-2008(4): You&#039;re screwing around on the roof of your <em>house</em> and decide to jump through the skylight (a <em>hole</em> in the roof). You hop through, no problem, but then your fat friend gives it a shot too, and he gets stuck - only his <em>legs</em> stick down from the roof. &quot;It&#039;s too<strong> tight</strong>,&quot;, he says. &quot;Get me out of here!&quot;. You try to pull him through, but no use - so now you have no choice but to carefully <em>saw</em> a bigger <em>hole</em> round his legs...careful!
