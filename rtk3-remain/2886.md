1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 22-11-2007(50): A dishonest taxi driver is<strong> circling</strong> to increase the fare -- trying to <em>stretch out</em> the ride, going around the block many <em>times</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(8): A taxi driver <em>stretches</em> out the time it takes to get to <em>Times</em> Square by<strong> circling</strong> around it (thanks mcfate).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 12-4-2010(2): Vultures are<strong> circling</strong> overhead while you are <em>stretched</em> out on the ground, unable to move. &quot;I wonder how many <em>times</em> they&#039;ll circle before coming down to eat?&quot; you think.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 29-9-2007(2): &quot;We seem to be<strong> circling</strong>! We&#039;ve already seen this landmark fifteen <em>times</em>!&quot; &quot;Oi, that&#039;s quite a <em>stretch</em>! It&#039;s more like twelve or thirteen <em>times</em>.&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Haych">Haych</a>] 11-11-2012(): When<strong> circling</strong> (working with or drawing circles) it is important to know what you have to multiply <em>times</em> the diameter to <em>stretch it out</em> into the circumference. That number is pi.
