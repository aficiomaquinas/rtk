## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 30-4-2008(40): Mr T, angel: Believe it or not, but <em>mr T</em> is actually an <em>angel</em>. He <strong>emigrated</strong> from heavens to right the wrongs on planet earth.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Weber">Weber</a>] 6-7-2007(13): When people emigrate, they believe they are going to some better place, a place which to them, is heaven-high.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 4-10-2007(10): The pearly white <em>angels</em> of heaven don&#039;t accept black <strong>emigrants</strong>. Not even a man of <em>Mr T</em>&#039;s stature would be allowed in.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 13-1-2009(5): Back in the day, any <em> person</em> who was an<strong> emigrant</strong> to the U.S. considered the Statue of Liberty an <em>angel</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 12-6-2010(2): (NB: For 僑 I use the alternative keyword <strong>TEMPORARY HOME</strong>.) The <strong>TEMPORARY HOME</strong> of <em>MR T</em> is, of course, in Los <em>ANGEL</em>es, as required by his work in showbiz.
