1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 25-11-2008(35): Give the<strong> spindle tree</strong> a spin, if you can guess where it lands <em>correctly</em>, you&#039;ll get a prize!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 19-3-2010(3): <strong>Spindle tree</strong> or Euonymus japonicus (botanical name). Far from being &quot;spindly&quot;, this tree is bushy and evergreen, thus making ideal hedging for those seeking privacy. So if you want to be anonymous, &quot;Euonymus&quot; is the <em>correct tree</em> to choose.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 13-6-2007(3): <strong>Spend a little</strong> time in a<strong> spindle tree</strong> and I am sure you will come up with the <em>correct</em> answer... eventually.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 14-2-2010(2): There&#039;s actually no such thing as the <strong>spindle tree</strong>, but it sounds like an appropriate name for a plant. Whenever young students are curious as to the name of an unusual <em>tree</em>, they ask their teachers. If the teacher doesn&#039;t know the <em>correct</em> name, the default answer they give is &quot;...um, yeah that&#039;s a<strong> spindle tree</strong>.&quot; They usually follow it up with some difficult-to-decipher technical language, like &quot;Yeah, the<strong> spindle tree</strong> is a dioecious evergreen monocotyledon. Native to Japan.&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 11-1-2009(2): I always forget what a <strong>spindle tree</strong> looks like. When that happens, I have to check Wikipedia to make sure I&#039;m looking at the <em>correct tree</em>.
