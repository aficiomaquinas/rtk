1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 5-9-2007(29): The easiest place to spot<strong> rust</strong> is when it grows on <em>blue</em> <em>metal</em>. All of my cars have been <em>blue</em>, and as soon as the first red<strong> rust</strong> appears, its off to the scrapheap.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 16-7-2010(13): <em>Metal</em> gets the <em>blues</em> when it starts to<strong> rust</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 29-7-2009(12): The <em>blue</em> oxidation that forms on <em>metals</em> like copper is a form of<strong> rust</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 2-11-2007(3): <strong>Rust</strong> in these parts comes about when a METAL is exposed to anoxygen, which results in a strange form of BLUE<strong> rust</strong> covering them, unlike the <a href="../v4/2038">rust-colored/cinnabar</a> (#2038 丹) we&#039;re used to.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 3-3-2010(2): When the <em>gold</em> wedding ring I gave my fiancee started to show signs of<strong> rust</strong>, her face turned <em>blue</em> with anger, and I was forced to tell her I bought it in Chinatown for fifty bucks (although the vendor assured me it was 22 carat <em>gold</em>).
