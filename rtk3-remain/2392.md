## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(21): When<strong> shingling</strong> with <em>flowers</em>, they can often block up your <em>mouth</em> and <em>ears</em> unless you wear the proper safety gear.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 12-7-2008(13): Flower, deaf: The <em>deaf</em> guy was<strong> shingling</strong> the roof of his house with <em>flowers</em> (ecohouse). Being <em>deaf</em> was an advantage since he didn&#039;t hear the comment of his neighbours.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 25-2-2008(9): There I was,<strong> shingling</strong> my home with FLOWERS, when my next door neighboor opened his MOUTH. &quot;What are you doing<strong> shingling</strong> you roof with FLOWERS?&quot; &quot;Listen!&quot; I said, &quot;Its my house and I will shingle it with what I want!!!&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 17-5-2008(5): I was a bit surprised to see the <strong>shingler</strong> on the roof on all fours with his <em>mouth</em> on the <strong>shingles</strong>. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; I asked. &quot;I&#039;m <strong>s(h)ingling</strong> out the <em>mushrooms</em> (<a href="../v4/2394.html">mushroom</a> (#2394 茸))&quot;, he said with his <em>mouth</em> full.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 30-6-2009(2): It&#039;s not a good idea to put <em>mushrooms</em> in your <em>mouth</em> while<strong> shingling</strong> your roof... for obvious reasons.
