## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 10-1-2007(40): On the long long <em>road</em> through the desert,<strong> far off</strong> you can see a <em>condor</em> flying...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shirahime">shirahime</a>] 27-8-2008(17): The condor might seem like its<strong> far off</strong> in the distance now, but if you don&#039;t start running down the road you could be dinner.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 15-3-2010(1): While on the <em>road</em>, I suddenly heard Andean panpipes playing. I looked up and saw a <em>condor</em><strong> far off</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(1): This <em>road</em> to kanji mastery makes me feel like I&#039;m <em>made of fail</em>: everything always seems so<strong> far off</strong> in the distance!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 3-8-2008(1): This is a pretty cool item you can get in <em>Mario Kart Road</em> - it&#039;s a little guy who rides a <em>vulture-shaped tram</em> that traverses over the top of the track, and tells you how<strong> far off</strong> the other racers are. You simply speak into a little radio asking for the location of a certain racer - &quot;Where&#039;s Mario?&quot; &quot;...uh, let&#039;s see...ah, there he is. Wow, you better get a move on if you want to place this race - he&#039;s really<strong> far off</strong>&quot;.
