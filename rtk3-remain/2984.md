1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 14-2-2008(24): The <strong>old<strong> longing</strong></strong> is a 欲 <a href="../v4/792">longing</a> (#792 欲) of the <em>heart</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(5): As you get old, you develop a <em>longing</em> for a new <em>heart</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 14-6-2008(3): <strong>Longing</strong>, heart: The old man had supressed his <strong>old<strong> longing</strong></strong> from his youth for many years, but nothing can stop <em>longing</em> if it comes from the bottom of one&#039;s <em>heart</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 20-3-2010(1): <strong>Longing of old</strong> came from the very bottom of one&#039;s <em>heart</em>. In today&#039;s <a href="../v4/792">longing</a> (#792 欲) the heart doesn&#039;t get a look in. Modern folk must be pretty shallow.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 13-4-2007(): Same story as for <a href="../v4/729">milk</a> (#729 乳) but this time<strong> longing</strong> [old] is<strong> longing</strong> with all your <em>heart</em>.
