## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-10-2008(50): What seemed to be <em>water</em> dripping from the <em>wooden</em><strong> roofbeam</strong> was actually <em>drops</em> of blood dripping from a <em>sword</em> lodged in it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 21-4-2007(10): He cut down the <em>tree</em> with a <em>sword</em> to make a new<strong> roofbeam</strong>, but when he saw <em>two drops</em> lying on the tree, he assumed there was too much <em>water</em> in the wood and he left it to dry first.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 12-7-2009(8): A while back, I was goofing around with my <em>sword</em> when I accidentally lodged it in the<strong> roofbeam</strong>. Apparently, I also poked a couple of holes in the roof because whenever it rains, some <em>water</em> drips onto the floor - <em>one drop from each side of the sword</em>. So that&#039;s why there is a <em>tree</em> growing on the floor now. :/.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 8-12-2008(2): <em>Water</em> is pouring in through the<strong> roofbeam</strong>s. You stick a <em>blade</em> in, and the flow subsides to just a couple of <em>drops.</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 1-7-2010(1): <em>Water</em> is used to clean the 2 <em>drops</em> of sap off the <em>sword</em> that cut the <em>tree</em> for the<strong> roofbeam</strong>. Pretty stupid carpenter if you ask me.
