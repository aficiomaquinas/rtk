1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 31-12-2008(27): Wtf<strong> terminate</strong>? This is &quot;ball&quot;. Use &quot;leather ball&quot; for keyword, imagine a leather american football packed with bound up rice.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 29-7-2009(14): <em>Rice</em> <em>bound up</em> with <em>leather</em> makes a good <strong>hacky sack</strong>. The game<strong> terminate</strong>s when the ball touches the ground. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemari">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemari</a>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 17-7-2007(5): To<strong> terminate</strong> the <strong>Terminator</strong>, we <em>bound-up</em> his <em>rice</em> with some <em>leather</em> and watched him starve to death. I can&#039;t find anything in regards to how this means &quot;terminate&quot;, just balls.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 21-3-2010(2): This kanji actually means &quot;ball&quot; but since we already have <a href="../v4/935">ball</a> (#935 球) 球 how about &quot;medicine ball&quot; - traditionally sand (or in this case <em>rice</em>) <em>wrapped</em> in <em>leather</em>. To link this with<strong> terminate</strong>: An oversize &quot;medicine ball&quot; is used as a wrecking ball to<strong> terminate</strong> old buildings.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 20-12-2009(2): To<strong> terminate</strong> use of this key word we <em>bound up</em> a kilo of <em>rice</em> in <em>leather</em> &amp; took turns using it as a <strong>ball</strong> to knock over<strong> terminate</strong> with. (+w/respect herman).
