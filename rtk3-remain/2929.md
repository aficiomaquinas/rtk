3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 10-3-2010(3): This kanji <em>can</em> in fact be written with a longer horizontal stroke (stroke 6) so the primitives indeed are as Heisig intended. Different fonts show this. Story: His life was full of <em>happiness</em> until I kicked him so hard in the<strong> testicle</strong>s that <em>blood</em> started gushing out.
