He had this really annoying loud speaker that would play a song and shout about how &quot; <a href="http://google.com/#q=美味しい”">美味しい”</a> his<strong> sweet potato</strong>es were. He would drive by my apartment and my work at all times of the day. It eventually pissed me off so much that I had a <em>ninja</em> on stand by to kill him. &quot;If I give the <em>word</em>,&quot; I told the <em>ninja</em>. The man found out though, and gave me some flowers, so I decided not to kill him.
