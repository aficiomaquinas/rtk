1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 14-3-2008(31): Before you open the<strong> sliding door</strong> to the <em>core</em> of the nuclear reactor, you&#039;d better put on your anti-radioactivity <em>cloak</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 17-7-2007(18): The safety violations at Japanese nuclear power plants are egregious! Not only are they built inside ancient Japanese castles, there are no considerations for contamination. I was visiting last month when I opened a <strong>sliding door</strong> to reveal the <em>cloak</em> room. All the scientists had haphazardly piled their <em>cloaks</em> on the <em>CORE</em> itself!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 16-1-2009(9): You move aside the<strong> sliding door</strong> into the inner (core) section of the house and catch a glimpse of the wife without her cloak on.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/At0m5k">At0m5k</a>] 19-8-2009(3): You have to bust through many <em>cloak</em>-like curtains and<strong> sliding door</strong>s in order to finally reach the <em>core</em> of the monumental home.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 23-4-2010(2): Note: A lot of fonts reproduce this with the &quot;animal tracks&quot; primitive in place of the &quot;rice&quot; primitive. I think that&#039;s the older way to write it.
