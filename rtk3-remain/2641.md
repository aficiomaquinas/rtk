## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-7-2009(18): During post-production of a movie,<strong> redaction</strong> is required for &quot;red action&quot;, or action that results in a bloody accident, like when they mis<em>calculated</em> how <em>large</em> an object <em>Spider-Man</em> could hold up with both hands.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 29-5-2008(10): Calculate, st bernard, venom: <em>Venom</em> had made an insidious plan to strike at the <strong>redaction</strong> office of the Daily Bugle, to scare the free press. He plans to leave corpses of dead <em>St.Bernards</em> on every desk of the news office. Now, he still needs to <em>calculate</em> how many <em>St. Bernards</em> are required...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 5-8-2010(7): The editor of a family newspaper finds a story that’s a bit too graphic. It describes in detail how during kendo practice <em>Spiderman</em>&#039;s <em>bamboo</em> stick snapped and impaled the <em>eye</em> of a nearby <em>St. Bernard</em>. “Hmm, some<strong> redaction</strong> needed here,” thinks the editor.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 25-3-2008(4): With a <em>bamboo</em> brush and I <em>keen</em> eye I edit the paper and draw <em>big</em> red <em>thread</em>-like marks under the poor sentences that need to be <strong>redacted</strong> (revised, edited).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kioku3">kioku3</a>] 18-8-2009(3): The original story of <em>Spiderman</em> showed Peter Parker with a genius <em>St. Bernard</em> who could <em>calculate</em> by using an abacus with his paws (not two hands). There was a<strong> redaction</strong> when they realized they needed action and a villain and not just 2 hours of a dog using an abacus.
