## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 11-11-2006(34): Only <em>prosperous</em> people (picture someone with a lot of bling) can afford to have<strong> iris</strong> <em>flowers</em> in the house regularly. They&#039;re too expensive for daily use.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-7-2008(16): Most people don&#039;t realize this, but there is a very specific biological reason that the<strong> iris</strong> <em>flower</em> has <em>flowers</em> that split into two main petal groups that generally face two completely different directions. The reason is that the<strong> iris</strong> <em>flower</em> was brought over from another solar system many light years away that had two <em>suns</em>. Thus, one petal group would face one <em>sun</em>, while the other petal group would face the other <em>sun</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 2-4-2009(9): You become so <em>prosperous</em> selling <em>flowers</em> (<strong>iris</strong>es) you buy Van Gogh&#039;s famous painting &quot;<strong>Iris</strong>es&quot; and hang in in your flower shop.

Story: <em>Prosperous</em> people have invented a new game, poke each other in the<strong> iris</strong> with<strong> iris</strong> <em>flowers</em>.
