1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 8-3-2007(30): The<strong> holly</strong> <em>tree</em> has leaves which are always green. This is very practical in <em>winter</em>, when so much isn&#039;t, so that&#039;s why it became very popular as christmas decoration.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(10): The<strong> holly</strong> is a <em>tree</em> that lasts through <em>winter</em> (aka the &quot;<strong>holly</strong> days&quot;) (thanks herman).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 24-1-2009(6): All the best<strong> holly</strong>-days are during the winters, x-mas, new years...emperor&#039;s birthday?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 20-6-2007(2): <em>Winter</em> is when I dress the <em>trees</em> with<strong> holly</strong> and good Christmas cheer.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hirata">hirata</a>] 4-2-2013(1): Cute tsundere Hiiragi Kagami offers you a Christmas gift under the<strong> holly</strong> tree one winter night. Naturally, she&#039;s looking away from you in an attempt to hide her feelings. (The kanji is pronounced ひいらぎ, and is used in the last names of both of the Hiiragi sisters in Lucky Star.).
