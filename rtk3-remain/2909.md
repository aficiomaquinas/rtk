## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 3-2-2008(33): If a <em>person</em> has <em>retainers</em>, then he can spend his life<strong> supinate</strong> (i.e. lying on his back doing nothing). (note: for the writing order think: <strong>S</strong>u<strong>P</strong>inate = <strong>S</strong>lave-<strong>P</strong>erson).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(11): <em>Slaves</em> are made to<strong> supinate</strong> before common <em>people</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 3-12-2008(4): <em>Mr. Garrison</em> gets <em>Mr. Slave</em> to<strong> supinate</strong> while he watches. (notice if you look at 臣 sideways it looks like a person bending over with a cock and balls.).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 10-10-2009(3): The <em>person</em> gave his starved <em>slave</em> some soup and he ate the <strong>soup</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>eight</strong> seconds.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Haych">Haych</a>] 11-11-2012(): <strong>SUPINATE</strong> is when your arms are at your sides with your hands pointed forwards like for bicep curls, it is also for when too much weight is supported on the front of the foot. <em>Retainers</em>, with their long work hours, were the first <em>people</em> to learn that if you<strong> supinate</strong> while standing, your legs get tired out quicker. One needs to maintain a neutral center of balance.
