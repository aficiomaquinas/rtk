2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/At0m5k">At0m5k</a>] 18-8-2009(7): <strong>Japanese barnyard millet</strong> (Echinochloa utilis). In Japan&#039;s past, this type of millet was grown where conditions were not suitable for rice paddies. It was far more common than <em>wheat</em> and helped to alleviate starvation when rice was damaged by cold weather. However since then it has become quite a <em>lowly</em> grain and is only grown in northern Iwate-ken.
