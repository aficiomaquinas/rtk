1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 6-10-2007(34): From the <em>pack of wild dogs</em> only <em>white</em> ones are chosen to be<strong> a-un</strong> (to guard the temple).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 29-5-2009(7): Statues of<strong> a-un</strong> dogs always have pigeons hovering around, so they end up all covered in white stuff.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 8-10-2007(3): (These are the lion-dog guards at the front of temples.) And they&#039;re always made of WHITE marble depicting the<strong> a-un</strong> eating a PACK OF WILD DOGS.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 2-8-2008(2): The<strong> a-un</strong> are special lion-<em>dogs</em> that protect the palacial estates of certain mafia bosses. In order to make a perfect<strong> a-un</strong>, one grabs a whole <em>pack of dogs</em> (you need two for each entrance (and you know mafia spreads have plenty of gateways), so you&#039;d best get a pack for the best deal!) and cover them in several layers of <em>white</em> - i.e., <em>cocaine</em>. Keep doing this and it will eventually petrify them, and you can place them by your gateways. Plus, if you&#039;re ever out of cash - easy drug stash.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 1-9-2006(1): The<strong> a-un</strong> in front of this temple are a <em>pack of dogs</em> (well, a pair of dogs to be precise), that are <em>white</em> coloured.
