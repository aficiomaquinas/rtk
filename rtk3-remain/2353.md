1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 24-7-2009(35): Get a <a href="../v4/2584">pheasant</a> (#2584 雉) to<strong> trim</strong> your <em>flowers</em> for you.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 18-11-2010(8): This lawn doesn&#039;t need just a<strong> trim</strong>. With <em>flowers</em> and weeds so thick I have <em>pheasants</em> nesting in it, it needs to be <strong>mowed down</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 10-3-2010(4): <strong>Trim</strong> <em>pheasants</em><strong> trim</strong> <em>flower</em>s, flabby ones leave <em>flower</em>s a ruin. Conventional wisdom. But the key word is off: 薙ぐ /なぐ is more radical than &#039;to<strong> trim</strong>&#039;, more like &#039;to <strong>slash</strong> down or away&#039;, as with a 薙刀 /なぎなた/long-handled sword, &amp; so, Sod&#039;s law, I hired a<strong> trim</strong> <em>pheasant</em> to<strong> trim</strong> my <em>flowers</em> &amp; he took a scythe to them instead!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 16-1-2009(3): Wtf<strong> trim</strong>? Using &quot;mow down&quot; as keyword. Picture a pheasant massacre where all the pheasants were mowed down and now flowers have been placed there to commemorate the event.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 28-11-2009(2): When you<strong> TRIM</strong> the FLOWER field with that huge mower you may also get a few PHEASANT - because they nest there.
