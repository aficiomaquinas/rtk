## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-7-2009(27): <em>Ivy</em> grows on the<strong> paddy-field ridge</strong> encircling the <em>rice field</em> as opposed to the intra-field paddy ridge that divides it in half.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 23-1-2010(16): [+mantixen] The ordinary 畔 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1204">paddy-ridge</a> (#1204 畔) dissects the <em>field</em> by dividing it in <em>half</em>, but the<strong> paddy-field ridge</strong> runs around the outside &amp; is covered in <em>ivy</em>. Disambiguate by noting that the hyphen in &#039;paddy-ridge&#039; divides the word itself in <em>half</em> (five letters each side) but &#039;paddy-field ridge&#039; has five extra letters on the right, the ridge itself, in fact, the part covered in <em>ivy</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 4-8-2008(3): This<strong> paddy-field ridge</strong> separates two paddy fields. The reason for it being made of <em>ivy</em> is a bit pathetic, but necessary - it turns out that the two neighboring paddy field owners got in a bit of a fight over whose paddy field irrigation system was the best. Then both of them started insulting the others&#039; systems, saying that they didn&#039;t want the others&#039; dirty water in their field. So they put <em>ivy</em> up between it, which sucks up all the water from the edges (which is why there is none).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 8-11-2010(2): 畦道 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2571">paddy-field ridge</a> (#2571 畦) (ケイ), あぜ ... Parts: 田 , 圭 ...
