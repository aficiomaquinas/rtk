## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 31-1-2007(28): That carpenter can never remember where his tools are, so there is a <em>gigantic arrow</em> pointing to his carpenter&#039;s square.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 9-1-2009(15): I pin down my carpenter&#039;s square with a <em>gigantic dart</em> to keep it from moving when I make my measurements.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 17-4-2007(7): My carpenter&#039;s square is hanging on that <em>gigantic dart</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 7-8-2008(2): This is a pretty bizarre carpenter&#039;s square. Most carpenter&#039;s <strong>square</strong>s have two functions - holding straight, 90 degree angles, and measuring. This one has two more. One side is a long <em>dart</em> - so you can measure with it and also stick it in the wall so that you can get a straight vertical every time. The other side is a <em>dong</em>. There is an obvious use for this, but the official one is that it looks gross, so nobody will steal it (this is a big problem with carpenter&#039;s <strong>square</strong>s).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 1-3-2012(1): This is a special kind of <strong>carpenter&#039;s square</strong> - in the hands of the right carpenter, it can be used to deflect <em>giant darts</em>, and as a killing tool. Perfect for the undercover carpenter.
