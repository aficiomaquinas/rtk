1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 21-1-2007(33): Look at the <strong>sides of his <em>mouth</em></strong>! His moustache is tied into great <em>knots</em>. They&#039;re not even symetrical. Look at the <em>knots</em> on the right side of the mouth! (though they&#039;re there on both <strong>sides of the mouth</strong>....

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gwindarr">Gwindarr</a>] 18-4-2008(20): Dimples. Those knots on the<strong> sides of the mouth</strong>. Too easy.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/montecristo73">montecristo73</a>] 10-9-2009(12): (Kanji used in the word kissing 接吻 = せっぷん) In a kiss mouths become like a single knot. In a good one, you use even the<strong> sides of the mouth</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 14-10-2008(7): There is <em>not</em> an <em>opening</em> on the<strong> sides of the mouth</strong> (hopefully).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 2-8-2010(4): <strong>Proboscis</strong> (body part that projects from/near the mouth, e.g. the elephant&#039;s tusk, an insect&#039;s feeders, human lips, etc.): <strong>Proboscis</strong> often refers to a part of the <em>mouth</em>, but <em>NOT</em> necessarily. (Note: Proboscis is the more accurate keyword assigned by Heisig in the supplemental kanji list he recently released.).
