## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-7-2009(39): A good <em>substitute</em> for <em>black</em> is<strong> blue-black</strong>, like the color women try to <em>substitute</em> for their <em>black</em> eyebrows with a pencil.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 17-12-2008(2): <em>Substitute </em> + <em>black</em>=<strong> blue-black</strong> or <strong>blackened-eyebrows</strong>. A close <em>substitute</em> for the color <em>black</em> is the color<strong> blue-black</strong>. Also, women in Japan sometimes have <strong>blackened-eyebrows</strong>, since their color is naturally a faint<strong> blue-black</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 7-6-2008(2): Substitute, black: The <em>substitute</em> techer didn&#039;t earn enough to buy a TFT with true <em>black</em> pixels. He just had to make do with a screen that seemed<strong> blue-black</strong> (especially when the sky reflected in it).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sunspot">Sunspot</a>] 5-2-2012(): Sigh... another Heisig fail.<strong> Blue-black</strong> is definitely 黝 (あおぐろい). Change the keyword to mascara or something.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 5-2-2011(): They were really getting smashed in the game. They <em>subbed</em> off one of their players who had been punched<strong> blue-black</strong> (black and blue). So they could not do as much damage to the next sub, they used a guy with <em>black </em>skin.
