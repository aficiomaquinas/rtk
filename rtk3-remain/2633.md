1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 17-7-2007(25): <em>Compared</em> to before when Japanese mothers used to throw a <em>hood</em> over their naughty kids and beat them bloody with <em>bamboo</em>, the modern &quot;kitchen-discipline by <strong>spatula</strong>&quot; seems much more civilized.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-7-2009(19): <em>Compare</em> the effectiveness of beating a <em>person</em> with <em>bamboo</em>, a <em>belt</em>, and a<strong> spatula</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 1-12-2008(4): I always carry a<strong> spatula</strong> for self-defence, but one time I met <em>some people in the hood</em> who had <em>bamboo</em> canes which were <em>comparably</em> better than my pissy little<strong> spatula</strong>, so to say they least they whooped my ass.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 14-12-2008(2): Japanese<strong> spatula</strong> is made of bamboo and is the size of two spoons. In fact it&#039;s so big, it can be used as a hood or an umbrella when it rains. Picture wearing a<strong> spatula</strong> on your head to get that middle part memorized.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 7-3-2008(2): <em>Compared</em> to my old <em>bamboo</em><strong> spatula</strong>, this one with metal <em>inside</em> is infinitely better.
