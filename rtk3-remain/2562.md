## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 28-7-2009(22): The <em>king</em> had a<strong> coral reef</strong> installed in his <em>lake</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 29-3-2007(6): Under the light of the <em>moon</em>, the adventurers secretly dived for the <em>old</em> wreckage in the<strong> coral reef</strong> that would contain a fabled <em>jewel</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yesterbean">Yesterbean</a>] 11-1-2010(4): Be careful not to get mixed up with <a href="../v4/558.html">reef</a> (#558 礁).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 21-11-2008(3): After reading about the jewels which are hidden amongst the coral, only the most <em>uncivilised</em> people would actually attempt to explore the<strong> coral reef</strong> to find <em>jewels</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 4-8-2008(2): [+mcfate] Coral is one thing (it&#039;s really just a color), but<strong> coral reef</strong> as a <em>&quot;jewel&quot;</em> is something totally weird. Actually, the <em>uncivilized</em> (remember, these uncivilized people were the type to eat the <em>flesh</em> of their <em>old</em>) people in China used to use this as money. They would wear bits of <em>coral reef</em> as a jewel in hopes that they would never get <em>old</em>, and thus have their <em>flesh</em> eaten. Interestingly enough, this wasn&#039;t REALLY<strong> coral reef</strong>- it was just junk from a nearby <a href="../v4/148.html">lake</a> (#148 湖).
