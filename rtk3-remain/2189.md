## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 8-5-2007(28): He came to finding himself down at the <strong>wharf</strong> with <em>soil</em> all over his tuxedo. The <em>maestro</em> can only guess that he&#039;d been drugged by some <em>needle</em> sharp dart, since the last thing that he recalled was feeling a prick on the bottom, before waking up at the <strong>wharf</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 20-2-2008(21): Note: Right side 阜 is <a href="../v4/2928.html">large hill</a> (#2928 阜).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 12-5-2009(17): If you build a<strong> wharf</strong> on a <em><a href="../v4/2928.html">large hill</a> (#2928 阜)</em>, the vessels should be able to sail the <em>soil</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 29-8-2010(12): You idiot! Why on earth did you build the<strong> wharf</strong> on a large hill? Are the ships supposed to sail through the dirt to get there? That is seriously the WORST place you could have built it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spleenlol">spleenlol</a>] 8-9-2010(5): This was once a <a href="../v4/2928.html">large hill</a> (#2928 阜) before the <em>soil</em> was removed to create a<strong> wharf</strong>.
