1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 15-6-2007(52): For a <em>cow</em> used to free-grazing, being stuck in a <em>house</em> is equivalent to being in<strong> jail</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 9-2-2007(23): Looking at the kanji 家 , keeping pigs in the house was normal. But, if you instead kept a <em>cow</em> in the <em>house</em>, you would be sent to <strong>jail</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 25-6-2009(10): Stuck in<strong> jail</strong>, otherwise known as the big <em>house</em> or the hoose<em>gow</em>, er, &quot;<em>-cow</em>&quot; (the &#039;c&#039;/&#039;k&#039; getting voiced into a &#039;g&#039; in the compound word...) (^ahem^).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 5-7-2008(3): Embarassing way to go to<strong> JAIL</strong>: they search your HOUSE and find a COW in your bed. Great, now you&#039;re going to<strong> JAIL</strong> on bestiality charges.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 25-8-2006(3): The man went to<strong> jail</strong> rather than paying the fine for keeping his <em>cow</em> in the <em>house</em>.
