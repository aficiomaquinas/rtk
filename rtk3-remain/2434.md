3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 7-6-2007(9): To tell if someone is<strong> sensitive</strong>, first make a <em>likeness</em> of their <em>heart</em>. Then observe them while you poke the heart, stick needles in it, etc. If the person reacts, then that means they are<strong> sensitive</strong>.
