2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 8-3-2008(30): That <em>one-human-legged</em> chihuahua that appeared before the capital in <a href="../v4/1969">concerning</a> (#1969 就) is<strong> understandably</strong> traumatized by the abuse he suffered at the hands of the scientists.

It&#039;s an easier visual image. It&#039;s<strong> UNDERSTANDABLY</strong> that when a CHIHUAHUA is humping your HUMAN LEG, you&#039;d want to shake the thing off.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 6-10-2007(8): <strong>Understandably</strong>, the <em>chihuahua</em> with <em>one human leg</em> walks a bit lopsided.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 30-11-2008(4): When a chihuahua tries to hump your leg, you<strong> understandably</strong> let it fini...I mean, shoo it away!
