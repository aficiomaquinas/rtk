## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 24-5-2008(20): Mysterious, crown, cow: In Kazad-dum, Gandalf had found a <em>mysterious crown</em>. It really helped his magic, but when they came back to Rivendell, he had become unresistable to the <em>cows</em> (small side-effect). He tried to<strong> tug</strong> the crown off, but did not succeed...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 11-6-2007(11): A <em>cow</em> is engaged in a<strong> tug</strong>-of-war with a<strong> tug</strong>boat. <em>Mysteriously</em>, the <em>cow</em> is <em>crowned</em> the winner.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(9): A <em>mysterious crown</em> appeared on the <em>cow</em> that wouldn&#039;t come off no matter how hard we&#039;d<strong> tug</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 5-8-2009(4): This is a really bizarre image, but it helps me remember the placement of the crown radical. I imagine <em>Gandalf</em> with a <em>crown</em> inexplicably around his waist, with a <em>cow</em><strong> tug</strong>ging on it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 13-3-2007(1): An <em>alien</em> with a <em>crown</em><strong> tug</strong>s at a <em>cow</em>, it wants to abduct the cow and put it into its spaceship!
