## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 20-6-2007(45): The<strong> evergreen oak</strong> is a <em>tree</em> most <em>strict</em> with its leaves: they must be <strong>evergreen</strong>, or else!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 11-1-2009(13): A very <em>strict</em> master dictates that the slaves must ensure that the <strong>evergreen oaks</strong> are ever green. One day a slave notices, to his terror, that one of them has turned brown! Not wanting to get buried up to his crotch in soil, he quickly pulls out a can of green spray paint and paints the entire <em>tree</em>. Even if that tree wasn&#039;t ever green before, it certainly is now!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 24-1-2009(3): <strong>Evergreen oak</strong>s are TREES that are STRICTLY green.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 5-9-2011(1): 樫 =橿=槝=櫧, <a href="../v4/2491">evergreen oak</a> (#2491 樫)？, かし ... Parts: 木 , 堅 <a href="../v4/853">strict</a> (#853 堅) ... Note: The tree カシ is both 橿 <a href="../v4/2509">sturdy oak</a> (#2509 橿) and 樫 <a href="../v4/2491">evergreen oak</a> (#2491 樫) ... Story: (Since &#039;strict&#039; for 堅い is a mistake anyway): My Girlfriend calls me the<strong> Evergreen Oak</strong>, because I always have <em>Wood</em>, and I am a <em>Slave</em> to my <em>Crotch</em> and my <em>Dirty, Dirty</em> mind, and she makes these names from elements of kanji.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Corodon">Corodon</a>] 30-12-2011(): The <strong>evergreen oak</strong> isn&#039;t a <em>tree</em>, <em>strict</em>ly speaking. It&#039;s a shrubbery. (not true, but if it helps with remembering this kanji...).
