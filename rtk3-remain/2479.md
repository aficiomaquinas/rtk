1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 20-6-2007(61): The <em>tree</em> was a little too high, but, hey, no problem, I&#039;ll just use my <em>younger brother</em> as a<strong> ladder</strong>!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 20-5-2010(7): The only one who really needs the<strong> LADDER</strong> to climb onto our <em>TREE</em> house is my <em>LITTLE BROTHER</em>. The rest of us can just scramble up.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 12-7-2009(5): If you have a <em>tree</em> house, be sure to use a rope<strong> ladder</strong>. That way, you can pull it up into the tree house after you climb up so that your annoying <em>little brother</em> can&#039;t try to come up too.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/montecristo73">montecristo73</a>] 12-7-2010(2): My younger brother climbed up the tree and can&#039;t come down now, so I&#039;ll go get him a<strong> ladder</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 19-11-2008(2): My horny <em>younger brother</em> grabbed a<strong> ladder</strong> to perve on the girls over the fence, unfortunately he was caught with a <em>woodie</em>.
