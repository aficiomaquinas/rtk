## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 23-2-2007(29): Not so long ago, if <em>Mr T</em> was <strong>working in a field</strong>, he would have been a slave.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 26-6-2008(15): The first television show that <em>Mr T</em> ever worked on was a slavery period drama. Operating on the assumption that all black people look alike, the director decided to save on his budget by just hiring one black person. In each scene requiring slaves in the background to<strong> work a field</strong>, he would put <em>Mr T</em> in the rice paddy in the background. Then when they changed the scene, he would simply put <em>Mr T</em> there too - no changing clothes, no CG - just the same dude in the background of EVERY scene.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paramausi">paramausi</a>] 29-7-2009(8): A <em>person</em> in a <em>field</em> is <strong>working a field</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/errtu">errtu</a>] 18-8-2010(6): MR T refuses to<strong> WORK A FIELD</strong>, says he can do better things with his BRAIN.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 30-4-2008(3): Mr T, ricefield: Not many people know this, but sometimes <em>mr T</em> needs to relieve stress. To this end, he purchased a <em>ricefield</em> in a rural part of Japan, where he can <strong>work the field</strong> without thoughts on the busy modern day life.
