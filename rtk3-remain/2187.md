1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 17-8-2006(48): Big consternation in the court! A little bit of <em>soil</em> in the garden touched the <em>empress</em>&#039; face and left a<strong> blemish</strong> there. Courtiers fainted left and right...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 14-10-2008(21): The <em>empress</em> gets a <em>soil</em> mask at the spa to treat a<strong> blemish</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 18-2-2010(11): 垢嘗 [akaname] or &#039;<strong>grime</strong> licker&#039; is a classical Japanese monster that comes out when your ofuro gets dirty and feeds on the filth. Its saliva is said to be poisonous. You can just picture it, hanging from the <em>ceiling</em> of your bathroom, <em>dragging</em> its enormous tongue wagging from its <em>mouth</em>, eating up all the <em>dirt</em>. If that doesn&#039;t help, try this: The <em>empress</em> is actually using the services of akaname to clean<strong> blemish</strong> off her face. As for the poison, well it works like botox..

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 8-8-2009(4): Using <strong>grime</strong> instead. &quot;Look at all this <strong>grime</strong>. There&#039;s <em>dirt</em> everywhere the <em>empress</em> screeches, attendants cleaning left and right. (If you use a google image search for this kanji a bunch of cleaning products come up).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 19-2-2007(3): It&#039;s not a serious <strong>blemish</strong>. It&#039;s just a bit of <em>soil</em> that accidentally smudged the <em>empress</em>&#039;s face. We wish that all <strong>blemish</strong>s would just wash off don&#039;t we?
