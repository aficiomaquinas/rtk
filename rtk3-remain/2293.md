1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 21-9-2006(44): In the forest fire, they<strong> douse</strong>d the <em>trees</em> with <em>water</em> to prevent more damage.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 14-5-2009(9): You use <em>water</em> to <a href="../v4/2079">irrigate</a> (#2079 沃) <em>saplings</em>. When it has become a <em>tree</em>, you need more. Then you have to<strong> douse</strong> it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 23-1-2010(6): We <strong>douse</strong>d the <em>trees</em> with <em>water</em> to prevent a forest fire. To disambiguate<strong> douse</strong> &amp; 渥 <a href="../v4/2320">moisten</a> (#2320 渥) recall that had we<strong> douse</strong>d the trees properly in the first place we might not have had to moisten the roof later.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 12-10-2007(5): Pun alert: dowsing is the use of a divining rod (usually a <em>tree</em>&#039;s forked branch), to find <em>water</em>. Dowse is also a legitimate alternative spelling for &quot;douse&quot; -- after you find the <em>water</em> you can <strong>douse</strong> the <em>tree</em> with it.
