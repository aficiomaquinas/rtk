## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 6-10-2008(40): DEVOTE (new rtk3 keyword). Think of the Yakuza. To show their DEVOTION to the clan, they must be<strong> DEDICATE</strong>D enough to cut off their FINGERS if they fail a task.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 10-1-2007(15): <em>Dedicated</em> people who<strong> dedicate</strong> themselves to growing bonsai cornstalkes have to have very fine <em>fingers</em> to work the bonsai cornstalk.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 18-8-2009(13): My <em>fingers</em> are <strong>devoted</strong> to writing kanji, because I <em>dedicated</em> myself to Japanese.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 26-7-2009(3): <em>Dedicated</em> <em>fingers</em> do <strong>devoted</strong> work.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 21-8-2008(3): They tried <strong>dedicate</strong> the grave, but <em>Fingers</em>, the thief, swiped the bonsai and cornstalk set apart to adorn the grave they were to <em><strong>dedicate</strong></em>, so they couldn&#039;t <strong>dedicate</strong> it. (ah, now I know why I missed this one....Heisig reused this RTK3 keyword in a later revision of RTK1, so &quot;observance/<strong>dedicate</strong>&quot; 1573 is the RTK1 keyword). In the 2nd edition of RTK3, the keyword for 2265 is &quot;<strong>devote</strong>&quot;.
