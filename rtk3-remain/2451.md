## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 6-10-2007(61): At<strong> dusk</strong> every day I go out in one of those airplanes that leaves a vapour trail and write my <em>family name</em> just above the setting <em>sun</em>. (I have to wait until<strong> dusk</strong> so that the sun is low enough in the sky).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 22-1-2009(18): The WOMAN abandoned her <a href="../v4/1830.html">marriage</a> (#1830 婚) as soon as<strong> dusk</strong> came.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(7): The woman leaves her <em>marriage</em> at<strong> dusk</strong> after all the guests have gone home.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xiaoma">xiaoma</a>] 22-3-2009(6): We go by our <em>family names</em> during the <em>day</em> at the office. At<strong> dusk</strong>, we head out with friends and don&#039;t have to be so formal.
