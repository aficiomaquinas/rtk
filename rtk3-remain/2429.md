## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 7-6-2007(53): You have to be <em>young</em> at <em>heart</em> to<strong> attract</strong> the opposite sex.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 5-6-2007(13): Take just one look at the junior idol video industry (or don&#039;t!) in Japan to understand how the <em>young</em><strong> attract</strong> the <em>hearts</em> of the Japanese. ;-).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 17-1-2008(5): Contrast with <a href="../v4/430.html">attractive</a> (#430 嬌). Think of<strong> attract</strong> the verb as specific procedures or actions taken to<strong> attract</strong> the opposite sex. The <em>young</em> and foolish think that pouring out your <em>heart</em> is the way to<strong> attract</strong> the opposite sex, but more mature lovers realize that restraint, mystery and coyness do much more to<strong> attract</strong> a partner. Remember,<strong> attract</strong> the verb: things you do; behaviors that may change over time. (not the adjective <a href="../v4/430.html">attractive</a> (#430 嬌)).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 18-11-2010(3): 惹く , 惹起する , 注意を惹く , 惹き付ける , <a href="../v4/2429.html">attract</a> (#2429 惹) ジャク( 若 ), ひく(now usu 引く ) ... Parts: 若 <a href="../v4/223.html">young</a> (#223 若), 心 (cf 匿う <a href="../v4/1692.html">hide</a> (#1692 匿)) ... Similars: 嬌声 <a href="../v4/430.html">attractive</a> (#430 嬌), 惹く <a href="../v4/2429.html">attract</a> (#2429 惹) ... Story: trophy wives<strong> Attract</strong>, because they are <em>Young at Heart</em>, they say. (I think it is not the young at heart that<strong> attract</strong>s them though.).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 20-12-2006(2): People who are <em>young</em> are often easily<strong> attract</strong>ed to each other, but they have a fickle <em>heart</em>: some of them seem to think being with the same person more than a day is uncommon!
