1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 29-4-2007(28): The<strong> zelkova</strong> is a sort of elm <em>tree</em> that is very good for making bonsais, setting a <em>standard</em> for other trees, so to speak.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 31-5-2009(19): In the A to Z of <em>trees</em>, the<strong> zelkova</strong> sets the <em>standard</em>, because it begins with &quot;Z&quot; and ends in &quot;A&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 16-2-2010(6): AKA 欅. When the government decided that the<strong> zelkova</strong> would be the <em>standard tree</em> to plant in public parks in Japan, the populace obeyed, and today the<strong> zelkova</strong> is the only <em>tree</em> you will ever see in Japanese parks (at least, those well-kept enough to observe the national <em>standard</em>).
