They used to play a game - <em>Sun</em> and <em>Moon</em> - where the master would stand at the top of a cliff and wave his hands as if to resemble sunrays, and the dog would lie on the ground in a crescent shape - then they would switch. But one day the master fell! The dog, for years after, would go to the spot where he fell at <em>sun</em> and <em>moon</em> rise and look<strong> despondent</strong>. Imagine the<strong> despondent</strong> puppydog eyes.
