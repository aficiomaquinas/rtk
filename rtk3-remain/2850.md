## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 20-7-2007(34): A<strong> comet</strong> flew by and knocked down <em>two bushes</em>, so I went out there and <em>swept</em> up the mess, cursing astrological bodies along the way.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 17-3-2010(10): Broom is ヨ. The lower primitive here resembles a rake 肀 without a handle (vertical stroke). STORY:<strong> Comet</strong>s actually have <em>2 bush</em>y tails (<a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9703/halebopp4_aac.jpg">http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9703/halebopp4_aac.jpg</a>). Imagine a NASA probe with an attachment like a <em>rake head</em> designed to catch (rake up) the fine particles streaming from the tails for later analysis.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 17-2-2011(5): Having <em>2 Bushes</em> for president hurt like a<strong> comet</strong> hitting the planet and it&#039;ll take more than a <em>broom</em> to clean it up.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 1-12-2008(4): A<strong> comet</strong> flew by and knocked down <em>two bushes</em>, so I went out there and <em>swept</em> up the mess, shocked to find a <em>broom</em> from outer space! (big ups Megaqwerty).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 25-10-2010(2): 彗星 =帚星=箒星 <a href="../v4/2850">comet</a> (#2850 彗) スイ ... Parts:2 丰, 彐＊ ... Story: The two <em>Bushes</em> both said &#039;No<strong> Comet</strong>&#039;, trying to <em>brush</em> the scandal under the rag. Bush malaprop: He meant to say <em>No Comment</em>.
