1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 31-5-2008(42): Word, needle, fishhook: The prisoner didn&#039;t speak a <em>word</em> in response to our<strong> query</strong>, so we got out our <em>needles</em> and <em>fishhooks</em> to get things going.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 28-11-2008(9): I needed to<strong> query</strong> as to how much <em>ten fishhooks</em> costs so I <em>said</em> to the shopkeeper &quot;How much for <em>ten fishhooks</em>?&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SimHuman">SimHuman</a>] 21-3-2010(4): Did you know that when you run a search<strong> query</strong> in Google, they probe web sites for your <em>words</em> using <em>needles</em> and <em>fish hooks</em>? True story!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 8-7-2008(4): If I want to know if the primitives <em>ten</em> and <em>fish hook</em> were used previously, I <strong>query</strong> my spreadsheet with the <em>words</em> given, and find <a href="../v4/280">swift</a> (#280 迅). Well, well, that was a swift answer.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 6-6-2010(1): The reporter&#039;s <strong>QUERIES</strong> are uncomfortable: his <em>WORD</em>s are as sharp as <em>FISHHOOK</em>s, as incisive as <em>CARPET NEEDLES</em>. (I use the <em>CARPET NEEDLE</em> primitive also in 絨 <a href="../v4/2657">carpet yarn</a> (#2657 絨)).
