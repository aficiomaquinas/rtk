## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 6-9-2009(23): What<em>stone</em> would make the best<strong> whetstone</strong>? I wandered <em>ten thousand cliffs</em> in search of an answer.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 22-6-2007(12): A<strong> whetstone</strong> so notorious that it had destroyed <em>ten thousand cliffs</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 29-12-2009(4): If you have an unusually long sword you may need a special<strong> WHETSTONE</strong> to sharpen it. Find a large ROCK on the side of a CLIFF and then rub the sword against it about TEN THOUSAND times to produce a keen edge.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 25-5-2008(3): Stone, cliff/10.000: That is the <em>cliff</em> where those <em>10.000</em> people have died (see also <a href="../v4/514.html">horse chestnut</a> (#514 栃)). The guilty parties have been apprehended and the <em>stone</em> block has been set ready for the beheading. A<strong> whetstone</strong> is used to sharpen the executioners&#039; axe.
