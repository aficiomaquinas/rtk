## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 6-10-2007(145): You are chasing the famous three blind <strong>mice</strong> and try to catch them by slamming a <em>mortar</em> on top of them. Success! You can see their <em>three tails</em> sticking out from under the mortar. In fact the impact has broken the first two tails, as you can see from the sharp angle they bend at, and the <em>two drops</em> (blood) on each. The third tail still curves nicely though, and hence has no drops of blood on it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 20-5-2010(13): Mighty<strong> Mouse</strong> is so tough you can hit him with a <em>mortar</em>, double <em>plows</em> coated with <em>4 drops</em> of rat poison, and you&#039;ll still never <em>hook</em> him.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 15-4-2009(6): A pictograph of an elaborate<strong> mouse</strong>-catching device. <em>A hook</em> on the front to grab them, <em>a couple of alternating ploughs</em> to slice them (spattered with <em>drops</em> of blood) and a <em>mortar</em> on top for the big jobs.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Regular">Regular</a>] 20-12-2010(5): Mortar LLC (a limited liability company) has a<strong> mouse</strong> dropping problem.
