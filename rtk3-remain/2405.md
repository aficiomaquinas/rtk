## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thairob">thairob</a>] 6-8-2008(37): After eating all the<strong> BRACKEN</strong> FLOWERS on the CLIFF, the MOUNTAIN GOAT belts out a huge YAWN and takes a nap. Unfortunately he never wakes up as the<strong> BRACKEN</strong> is highly carcinogenic to mountain goats....

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(15): <strong>Bracken</strong> is a <em>flower</em> that grows on <em>cliffs</em> and resembles a <em>fish spine</em> <em>lacking</em> stability.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 3-7-2009(8): This is the name of a city (わらび) in Saitama. The kanji is so difficult to write, the city government sells a t-shirt with the stroke order: <a href="http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20090702p2a00m0na004000c.html">http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20090702p2a00m0na004000c.html</a>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 8-5-2007(7): These unusual type of<strong> bracken</strong> <em>plants</em> do not grow in the usual forest places, but actually high on a <em>cliff</em>. Because the area <em>lacks</em> <em>mountaingoats</em>, the plants aren&#039;t eaten by them.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 5-12-2009(2): <em>Lackin&#039;</em> the<strong> bracken</strong> to blacken: An old tale in the <em>mountain goat</em> community has it that a wee goat may attain the black coat so much admired in the dominant discourse by eating the small <em>flowers</em> of a particular variety of<strong> bracken</strong> that grows on a particular <em>cliff</em>. This Kanji depicts one who tried it, ate all the<strong> bracken</strong> he could hold, but, alas, he had the wrong cliff, &amp; therefore the wrong<strong> bracken</strong>. His coat has not changed &amp; he is in despair, still <em>lackin&#039;</em> the<strong> bracken</strong> to blacken.
