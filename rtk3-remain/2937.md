5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 27-10-2007(): You whack the cricket ball away, but surprisingly it <strong>stops short</strong> even before it reaches short stop. The reason is it hit a passing <em>snake</em> (and knocked a chunk out of him). Note: &quot;short stop&quot; is a fielding position in cricket.
