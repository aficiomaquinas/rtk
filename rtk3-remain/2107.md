## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 21-9-2007(33): <em>Mr T</em> approaches the knights and stabs his <em>scissors</em> into the table they&#039;re seated at. &quot;I pity the fool who questions my<strong> chivalry</strong>!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 26-6-2008(25): <em>Mr. T</em> believes in<strong> chivalry</strong> - so whenever he plays a game of rock, paper, scissors, he always throws <em>scissors</em> to let the other person win. Note that this has nothing to do with women at all (hence the absence of women in this kanji) - just with everybody being weaker than <em>Mr T</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 18-2-2007(9): <strong>Chivalry</strong> demands equal weapons in a duel. So if a <em>person</em> challenges you with <em>scissors</em>, you&#039;ll have to duel him with your own pair.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 8-5-2007(4): <strong>Chivalry</strong> demands equal weapons in a duel. So if Mr. T challenges you to a duel with <em>scissors</em>, you&#039;ll have to duel him with your own pair. That&#039;s true <strong>chivalry</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 29-5-2012(3): <em>Mr. T</em> pleads for<strong> chivalry</strong> and that gang wars be fought with <em>scissors</em> instead of glocks. 武侠 ぶきょう<strong> chivalry</strong>.
