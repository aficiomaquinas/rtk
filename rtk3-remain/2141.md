## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Weber">Weber</a>] 2-7-2007(44): The<strong> earlybird</strong>s always get all the best food at the buffets, and all the latecomers get are just leftover bones, you can almost see the wind and tumbleweeds rolling over it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Crowfoot">Crowfoot</a>] 17-4-2008(22): You can either fly like the <em>wind</em> and be an<strong> earlybird</strong> at the buffet or come late and be left with only the <em>bones</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 6-10-2007(8): The<strong> earlybird</strong> is just about to catch the worm when it is caught by a gust of <em>wind</em> and slams into the ground and dies. The worm now eats the<strong> earlybird</strong> instead, just leaving a pile of <em>bones</em>. (At the end of this sequence, imagine the<strong> earlybird</strong>&#039;s bones being blown away by the wind.).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 18-1-2011(3): The<strong> earlybird</strong> gets the <em>windy bone</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 5-6-2009(3): The<strong> earlybird</strong> has already been here. All that remains of the worm are some bones blowing the wind.
