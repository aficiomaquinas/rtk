## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 17-6-2007(32): To<strong> winnow</strong> you need two things: a <em>winnowing fan</em> (no. 2643 箕 ) and a <em>pelt</em> (to use as a bag to collect the grain you<strong> winnow</strong>ed).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 25-3-2008(6): Having no <em>winnowing fan</em> handy, the servant was forced to flap a large <em>pelt</em> about in an attempt to<strong> winnow</strong> (fan) his master.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 8-12-2009(3): After Bobby Fischer&#039;s 箕 <a href="../v4/2643.html">winnowing fan</a> (#2643 箕)<strong> winnow</strong>ed Spassky&#039;s bamboo pawn from the other pieces in the famous game three, the rest was history: Spassky returned to Moscow in disgrace &amp; was <em>pelted</em> by fruits &amp; vegetables.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 6-3-2010(2): Now you may have seen the traditional<strong> winnow</strong>ing technique whereby grain is placed on a sheet (or <em>pelt</em>) which is then held at the corners and flicked to send the grain into the air. The <a href="../v4/2643.html">winnowing fan</a> (#2643 箕)箕 creates a draft to disperse the chaff. So the fan, by itself is not enough. To<strong> winnow</strong> we need to pair the <em>winnowing fan</em> with the <em>pelt</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dancingblade">dancingblade</a>] 16-11-2011(1): The officials discovered that the <em>chess</em> master was cheating using a <a href="../v4/2643.html">winnowing fan</a> (#2643 箕) so they stripped him of it. However the <em>chess</em> master somehow retained the ability to <strong>WIN NOW</strong>. Frowned upon by the <em>chess</em> community, he is often <em>pelted</em> with <em>rooks</em>.
