1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 15-8-2008(24): This is actually the old<strong> ten thousand</strong> yen bill in Japan - <em>Jiminy Cricket</em> surrounded by a wreath of flowers. It&#039;s pretty uncommon to see nowadays since it was only in print for a few days immediately after the war (MacArthur wanted a way to make sure that even the rich kept their atrocities in their consciences).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cb4960">cb4960</a>] 16-2-2009(12): Your <em>flowers</em> will not be safe if <strong>ten thousand [old]</strong> <em>Jiminy Crickets</em> come to town.

Story: <em>Vern/Jiminy Cricket</em> has a bad <em>Rose</em> allergy: &quot;I am really <strong>Itchy Man</strong>&quot; he says. I tell him that is a really old joke, and he should stop.
