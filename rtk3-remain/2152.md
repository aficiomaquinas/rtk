## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 17-5-2007(49): What happened to the <strong>kitchen</strong>? It was here a second ago... Well, it fell off the <em>cliff</em>. See the <em>table</em> down there below the edge of the <em>cliff</em>? Maybe we can <em>glue</em> it back together. Of course, first we&#039;ve got to retrieve the <strong>kitchen</strong> from the base of the <em>cliff</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 27-6-2007(14): We started to <a href="../v4/1629">fight</a> (#1629 闘) in the<strong> kitchen</strong>, but we kept on moving about and, before I knew it, she had me cornered atop the <em>cliff</em>face.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Corodon">Corodon</a>] 26-11-2011(9): I took the natto (<em>bean glue</em>) out of the<strong> kitchen</strong> and threw it off a <em>cliff</em> like any rational person would.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 7-1-2009(7): Dammit, the<strong> kitchen</strong> TABLE fell of a CLIFF, I wonder if I can glue it together.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eckbw">eckbw</a>] 3-7-2011(1): In the<strong> kitchen</strong>, Mr Bean is trying to cook a turkey but manages to glue it to his head instead. His girlfriend has to help him get it off but when it comes off it flies out the window and down a cliff outside.
