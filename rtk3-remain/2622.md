## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 22-6-2007(32): It&#039;s a<strong> concubine</strong>: feel free to <a href="../v4/672">touch</a> (#672 接) her all you want.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 12-12-2008(22): A<strong> concubine</strong> is a <em>woman</em> you can <em>stand</em> on and walk all over. She does not have the same status as a wife. The contrast can be seen in the compound: 妻妾 (one&#039;s wife and mistresses). Both are <em>women</em>; however, the wife gets a <em>brush</em> for her hair; whereas the<strong> concubine</strong> is <em>stood</em> upon and trampled.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 28-4-2006(9): <strong>Concubine</strong>s are women of low standing (which is also why the woman is at the bottom here).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 22-2-2007(3): The<strong> concubine</strong>s here are merely work forces for the master of the house. See them walking around, a line of <em>women</em> with a <em>vase</em> on their head to carry water from the well to the house.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 20-12-2006(3): A<strong> concubine</strong> is a woman on her back with her &#039;<em>vase</em>&#039; in the air...
