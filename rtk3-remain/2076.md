## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 15-4-2007(55): &quot;Without the right metal, that there<strong> suit of armor</strong> won&#039;t mount to more than a hill &#039;o beans!&quot; said the dwarven smith as I embarked on my quest - with my aluminum-foil hat and shield.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 13-6-2007(32): A<strong> suit of armor</strong> crafted from <em>metal</em> so strong that it could withstand the weight of a <em>mountain of beans</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 7-1-2009(18): This <em>metal</em><strong> suit of armor</strong> is making it hard to climb this <em>hill of beans</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zanzibar">zanzibar</a>] 23-4-2009(9): A<strong> suit of armor</strong>, though made of METAL, won&#039;t amount to a HILL OF BEANS in today&#039;s warfare.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hanamijin">hanamijin</a>] 5-7-2010(4): Suit of armour: gold, mountain, beans. This golden suit of armour looks impressive. I wonder if it can keep a handful of beans intact, put under a mountain! [J-clue: American football 鎧球 がいきゅう is played in a suit of armour.].
