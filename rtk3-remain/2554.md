1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 2-7-2007(24): The mechanism in my old grandfather clock suddenly broke with an almighty<strong> chime</strong> and one of the <em>jewels</em> was thrown out through the window into a nearby <em>grove</em> of trees. I&#039;m now searching for the <em>jewel</em> in the <em>grove</em> while the clock continues to<strong> chime</strong> incessantly.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-7-2009(15): The <em>king</em> knew playtime in the <em>grove</em> was over when he heard the clock tower<strong> chime</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 21-11-2008(7): When the <em>king</em> got lost in the <em>grove</em>, he could easily find his way back to the castle by following the sounds of the<strong> chime</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 5-8-2009(3): The<strong> chime</strong> refers to the tinkling of jewels. Story: the <em>king</em> got lost in the <em>grove</em>, but we were able to find him by following the<strong> chime</strong>s from his copious amounts of jewelry tinkling together.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 24-11-2010(2): 琳瑯たる (tinkling sound of jade) <a href="../v4/2554">chime</a> (#2554 琳) リン ... Parts: 王 , 林 (cf 淋しい <a href="../v4/2310">solitude</a> (#2310 淋)) ... Similars: 琳 <a href="../v4/2554">chime</a> (#2554 琳), 玲 <a href="../v4/2568">tinkling</a> (#2568 玲) ... Story: It&#039;s hard not to think of a wind<strong> chime</strong>, but this about carved wooden jewels of the wind<strong> chime</strong> itself, and not the wind. Of course there need to be <em>two wooden jewels</em> in order to bang together to make the<strong> Chime</strong>.
