## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 7-6-2007(60): Nick XXX needs a heart transplant quick. He goes to a <em>meeting of butchers</em> where one of them is about to chop up an ideal <em>heart</em>. Nick snatches away the heart from under the butcher’s knife – just<strong> in the nick of time</strong>. (note: replace XXX with a Nick you know).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 26-11-2006(28): The guy who had a <em>heart</em> attack at the <em>butcher&#039;s meeting</em> was saved<strong> in the nick of time</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 6-3-2010(16): To ensure <em>healing</em> 癒 , you must banish the <em>sickness</em> 疒<strong> in the nick of time</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikemorr">mikemorr</a>] 2-1-2010(6): Depending on the font you&#039;re using, the top part of this kanji is either 兪 or 俞. 俞 (Yú) is a Chinese family name. If &quot;<em>butcher&#039;s meeting</em>&quot; doesn&#039;t help you remember 俞 in <a href="../v4/289">transport</a> (#289 輸), <a href="../v4/352">rebuke</a> (#352 諭), <a href="../v4/628">pleasure</a> (#628 愉), <a href="../v4/2037">healing</a> (#2037 癒), and <a href="../v4/2433">in the nick of time</a> (#2433 愈), think of a specific person with that name instead, such as 俞晴 (actress/singer Yu Qing), 俞琤 (HK radio personality Winnie Yu Ching), 俞逊发 (flutist Yu Xunfa), 俞飞鸿 (actress Faye Yu / Yu Feihong), or 俞鴻鈞 (fmr. ROC premier Yu Hung-Chun).
