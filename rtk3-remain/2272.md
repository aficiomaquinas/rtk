1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 16-6-2007(24): My <em>turkey</em> suit, complete with actual <em>feathers</em>, was so<strong> outstanding</strong> that farmers tried to hunt me down with hatchets: I promptly gave them the <em>finger</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-2-2008(13): Tip: <em>feathers</em> + <em>turkey</em> : This combination of primitives appears six times in Heisig, so it&#039;s worthwhile giving it a name. I suggest &quot;<em>futon</em>&quot; (your <em>futon</em> is made from <em>turkey feathers</em>). REF: <a href="../v4/576">weekday</a> (#576 曜) , <a href="../v4/577">laundry</a> (#577 濯), <a href="../v4/1285">leap</a> (#1285 躍), <em>outstanding</em> (FRAME 2272), <a href="../v4/2534">twinkle</a> (#2534 燿), <a href="../v4/2880">shimmering</a> (#2880 耀).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 18-6-2009(11): I still haven&#039;t gotten the hang of folding up the futon, so I ask my host mother to demonstrate it to me. Watching her <em>fingers</em> move lightening fast and fold up that <em>futon</em> in mere seconds, I can only mutter &quot;...outstanding!&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 6-1-2007(10): His <em>turkey</em> costume was really<strong> outstanding</strong>: it was full of real turkey <em>feathers</em>, and he even managed to make convincing bird claws of his <em>fingers</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penot">penot</a>] 2-10-2008(6): I felt the <em>turkey-feather futon</em> with my <em>fingers</em> and could tell it was<strong> outstanding</strong>!
