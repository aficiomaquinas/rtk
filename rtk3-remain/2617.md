## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 12-7-2007(42): The original Japanese<strong> kitchen stove</strong>s were powered by <em>electric eels</em> (hey, Edison never made it to the far east!), so a small <em>hole</em> had to be placed in the <em>dirt</em> under the stove (for the <em>eels</em> to swim around in).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 25-11-2008(7): We finally found the <em>tortoise that escaped</em> (<a href="../v4/1377.html">straw rope</a> (#1377 縄)), it has somehow crawled into a <em>hole</em> just above the<strong> kitchen stove</strong> and had become quite <em>dirty</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 23-10-2007(3): I&#039;m going to make some turtle soup, so I take an <em>unbound</em> <a href="../v4/534.html">tortoise</a> (#534 亀) out of a <em>hole</em> in the <em>soil</em>, to place on the<strong> kitchen stove</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(1): A<strong> kitchen stove</strong> used to be a <em>hole</em> in the <em>soil</em> into which you put <em>eels</em> for dinner.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 13-4-2007(): To prepare my delicious <em>eels</em>, I first have to dig a <em>hole</em> in the <em>soil</em> to make sure my<strong> kitchen stove</strong> is steady.
