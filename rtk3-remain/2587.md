1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 22-10-2007(25): A<strong> grapnel</strong> is a small anchor with several hooks, used for anchoring small boats, or to pull up sunken objects (it looks very much like a grappling hook). The position of <em>stones</em> underwater <em>determines</em> where the<strong> grapnel</strong> will catch.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 17-3-2007(13): He was <em>determined</em> to climb this <em>rock</em>, so he used a<strong> grapnel</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 21-12-2010(7): This reminds of Link&#039;s hookshot. The annoying thing about his<strong> grapnel</strong> was that it could only hook onto <em>rocks</em> pre-<em>determined</em> by the game&#039;s maker. Just think of how many frustrating puzzles you could skip over if it could grab onto anything!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch">NeoGlitch</a>] 12-5-2012(1): If you ever played Zelda Wind Waker then you know the<strong> grapnel</strong> can only be hooked to special kinds of <em>stones</em>. The specific design of the stone (it usually has a white circle somewhere) <em>determines</em> if you can use your<strong> grapnel</strong> on it or not.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 18-9-2010(1): The type of <em>stone</em> a<strong> grapnel</strong> snags will <em>determine</em> whether the climber lives or dies.
