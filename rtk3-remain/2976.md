2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 14-6-2008(12): Mountain, bird: On the <strong>alternative<strong> island</strong></strong>, <em>birds</em> could just breed beside the <em>mountains</em> instead of upon one. The hippies didn&#039;t do any harm.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 20-3-2010(1): <strong>Islands alternate</strong> between those 島 with flightless <em>birds</em> (no aerodynamic <em>tail feathers</em>) and those 嶋 having <em>birds</em> with tail feathers (and the power of flight). The tail-less birds have migrated to the mountaintops to escape persecution from invaders (humans, cats etc.).
