## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 4-10-2009(23): The <em>cocoon</em> like piece of <em>flesh</em> between <em>human legs</em> can produce<strong> blood relative</strong>s.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 7-10-2007(14): I think Halpern&#039;s keyword &quot;progeny&quot; is a better fit for this kanji. Then: <strong>Progeny</strong> – a <em>cocoon</em>-like <em>piece of flesh</em> that drops out between two <em>human legs</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(10): The <em>body part</em> between <em>Venom</em>&#039;s <em>legs</em> can produce<strong> blood relative</strong>s.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 10-3-2010(3): Imagine a young alien still wrapped in its <em>cocoon</em>. Because the aliens are born in hives, it doesn&#039;t have to be the parent that comes to feed it, merely another member of the hive, who is a distant<strong> blood relative</strong>. The<strong> blood relative</strong> brings the <em>cocooned</em> alien infant a <em>piece of meat</em> as its first meal - a pair of disembodied <em>human legs</em>, ripped off an individual from the planet they just colonised.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 4-9-2011(1): 落胤 = 落し胤 , 胤違い =種違い, 名 : 平田篤胤 <a href="../v4/2921">blood relative</a> (#2921 胤) イン, たね ... Parts: 儿, 幺, 月 ... Story:The usual <em>Monthly</em> visit of a woman&#039;s <strong>Blood Relative</strong> ends up just being <em>Body parts</em> on the <em>Cocoon</em>, spilt between the <em>Legs</em> (agreeing with <strong>Progeny</strong> being a more useful keyword.).
