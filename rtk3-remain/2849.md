1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 30-12-2008(22): (re: Katsuo) If you <em>tow water</em> in a wheelbarrow, some of it is sure to<strong> dribble out</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 27-4-2008(22): Tip: Heisig has duplicated a primitive name here by calling the right side <em>drag</em>. We already have a two-stroke primitive called <em>drag</em> (see numbers 1853-1861 盾 , 派 , 脈 , 逓 , 后 ). I suggest calling 曳 &quot;<em>tow</em>&quot; instead.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 27-8-2007(9): Good <em>water</em> flows and thus keeps on moving, but here, the <em>water</em> has too much <em>drag</em> and thus can<strong> dribble out</strong> of its tube.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 1-12-2008(8): If you <em>drag</em> your water bottle along behind you, <em>water</em> will begin to<strong> dribble out</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 5-11-2010(5): 漏洩 , 洩れる =漏れる, 洩らす =漏らす, <a href="../v4/2849">dribble out</a> (#2849 洩) エイ( 曳 ), もれる, もらす ... Parts:氵, 日 , 戈-丶(see 曳く <a href="../v4/2848">drag</a> (#2848 曳)) ... Note: Now replaced by 漏れる . Also appears as 泄 in compounds. Used in Chinese Astrology) ... Story: After the all <em>Day Fiesta without a drop</em> to drink, it was not surprisingly that when I went to &#039;make <em>water</em>, only a tiny bit <strong>Dribbled Out</strong>. Or when you <em>Drag</em> a boat from the water, the <em>Water</em> Dribbles Out the back.
