## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 21-6-2007(39): Due its tendency to encrypt all its messages, the<strong> cryptomeria</strong> has been a fairly <em>prosperous tree</em> whereas all the other <em>trees</em> have already fallen prey to espionage.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(8): The<strong> cryptomeria</strong> （すぎ） is a <em>tree</em> that enjoys <em>prosperity</em> in Japan because it&#039;s written kanji is like an encrypted form of the more infamous スギ（ 杉 ） which causes hay fever.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 10-3-2010(3): The<strong> cryptomeria</strong> [すぎ - also written (encrypted) as 杉 <a href="../v4/1713.html">cedar</a> (#1713 杉)] is a valuable timber <em>tree</em> so growing them would naturally lead to <em>prosperity</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 16-2-2010(1): Those whose families were <em>prosperous</em> enough to provide them with a proper education will learn to take the three wild, stabbing strokes from the right hand side of 杉 and reassemble them into the more sophisticated and <em>prosperous</em> form seen in this kanji. Similarly, in English, while many know the word &quot;<strong>cedar</strong>&quot;, and may refer to the 杉 as the Japanese <strong>cedar</strong>, those <em>prosperous</em> enough to be educated further may learn the botanical name,<strong> Cryptomeria</strong> japonica.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 30-10-2009(1): [+Megaqwerty] Because of its tendency to encrypt all its messages, the<strong> cryptomeria</strong> has been a <em>prosperous tree</em> while the Ave Maria trees have fallen prey to espionage.
