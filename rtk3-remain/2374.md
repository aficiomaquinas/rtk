## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 14-12-2008(32): Another Heisig RTK3 fail. I&#039;m going to use &quot;owing to&quot; as the keyword -- it&#039;s mostly used in 御蔭で (thanks to you). Thanks to you, I was even able to grow flowers in the shade, no easy task.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 18-6-2007(18): <strong>Behind the scenes</strong>, in the <em>shady</em> areas, they trade various <em>flowers</em>: oh, yeah, gather &#039;round the good stuff!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 19-5-2009(8): <strong>Behind the scenes</strong>, in the <em>shady</em> areas, it is very difficult to grow <em>flowers</em>. But thanks to you ( 御蔭で ) we were able to do it. Now we are smoking them<strong> behind the scenes</strong> (thx Megaqwerty and herman).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 30-10-2010(2): 御蔭で =お陰で, <a href="http://google.com/#q=蔭は光より暗く、影は蔭よりなお暗し">蔭は光より暗く、影は蔭よりなお暗し</a> (literary line) <a href="../v4/2374">behind the scenes</a> (#2374 蔭) イン, かげ ... Parts:艹, 陰 ... Note: (<strong>旧字体 for 陰 <a href="../v4/1592">shade</a> (#1592 陰)</strong>) ... Similar Keywords all read かげ: 陰 <a href="../v4/1592">shade</a> (#1592 陰) is just about Frosty hiding behind the Clock tower. A 影 <a href="../v4/1712">shadow</a> (#1712 影) however has a definite Shape. And お蔭で <a href="../v4/2374">behind the scenes</a> (#2374 蔭) is Shade once removed, in the Daisy patch.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-7-2008(2): Looks like Flavor of Love (<em>Flava Flav</em>&#039;s TV show, taped in his <em>Pinnacle</em> mansion) is about to end - the last woman has been chosen, and the credits are rolling - but wait! <em>Behind the scenes</em>, there is an extra bonus woman waiting in the <em>shade</em>, holding a boquet of flowers. Looks like we&#039;re in for one last episode as the two women fight it out over the right to be <em>Flava Flav</em>&#039;s little <em>flower</em>.
