1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 26-4-2007(79): Story by katsuo (but not yet posted) - At a small concert for the Beatles I was hanging <em>eight towels</em> from the <em>celing</em>. I asked Paul if he wanted me to <em>stitch</em> them together but he said &quot;<strong>Let It Be</strong>&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-10-2008(20): There&#039;s a new cabaret show in town called <em>&quot;It&#039;s Raining X-Men&quot;</em> where <em>eight</em> Chippendales dress up in superhero costumes for the ladies. I would say something <em>negative</em>, but I just shake my head and<strong> let it be</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/EratiK">EratiK</a>] 25-8-2011(13): No matter what <em>tool</em> you use, this <em>towel</em> is beyond repair, even with <em>stitching</em>. Better<strong> let it be</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog">stupiddog</a>] 5-3-2011(6): The buddhist term Heisig refers to means jinenhoni 自然法爾 , &quot;things come into being spontaneously of themselves without any cause or intention. Similarly, what will bring us to salvation is not our own power, calculations, or intention.&quot; (Ibrahim Soner Ozdemir, <a href="http://www.sanart.org.tr/PDFler/85b.pdf">http://www.sanart.org.tr/PDFler/85b.pdf</a>). So: <em>Eight</em> <em>nails</em> <em>stitched</em> into your <em>belt</em> won&#039;t repair it, just <strong>let it be</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rowdyphantom">rowdyphantom</a>] 26-3-2010(6): <strong>Let It Be</strong>--This song drove a <em>wedge</em> (nail) between the four Beatles (John thought it was too religious). It was the <em>eighth</em> track. The <em>belt</em> and <em>four stitches</em> were an attempt to hold the band together long enough to create Abbey Road.
