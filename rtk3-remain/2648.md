## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(32): <strong>Settlings</strong> at the bottom of sake are <em>white</em> and made of <em>rice</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 27-6-2010(7): (in drawing order): The<strong> settlings</strong> you see in sake are actually bits of <em>rice</em>. How do you know? Because they are <em>white</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 12-12-2008(2): <strong>Scrap, waste,<strong> settlings</strong>.</strong> Think of <strong>scrap</strong> or waste paper - like the confetti or <em>rice</em> thrown at a wedding - it is <em>white</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 8-8-2009(1): <strong>Settlings</strong> stick to the bottom of the sake cup like <em>white</em> on <em>rice</em>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/comeauch">comeauch</a>] 6-8-2012(): As we&#039;ve seen so far, the &quot;white&quot; primitive often means something like &quot;the best&quot; (see &quot;chief&quot;, &quot;ship&quot;...) The best rice, the purest white rice is used to make sake and ultimately ends up as settling.
