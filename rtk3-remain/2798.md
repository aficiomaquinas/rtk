1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 29-11-2008(25): Remember that dazzling <em>evening</em> where you found the <em>magic wand</em> and used it on your <em>crotch</em> to make it bigger? Well this time you use the wand to disguise your little guy as <em>food</em> so that she thinks it&#039;s a<strong> repast</strong>. <a href="../v4/2543">dazzling</a> (#2543 燦).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 17-7-2007(10): What <em>dazzling food</em>! This shall be the most splendid<strong> repast</strong> yet!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 6-2-2011(2): To keep this separate from other keywords, I&#039;m going to give this the connotation of left-overs since the word past is in<strong> repast</strong>. After the crazy night with the <em>stripper</em>, the only <em>food</em> left in the fridge is pizza left-overs. It makes a good<strong> repast</strong> though.

[thanks bodhisamaya for <a href="../v4/2543">dazzling</a> (#2543 燦) story].
