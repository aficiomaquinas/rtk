## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 12-4-2007(47): Just like the ones on a rhinoceros, there are little birds who like to<strong> peck at</strong> the skin near the <em>mouth</em> of a <em>sow</em> and clean it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 7-10-2009(10): A scavenger bird is <strong>pecking at</strong> the <em>mouth</em> of a dead <em>pig</em> in a field. The snout and tongue are the most delicious parts of the carrion.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 16-4-2010(6): The typical story of <em>anorexia nervosa</em>: a pitiful emaciated girl who doesn&#039;t really eat, but rather just <strong>PECK</strong>s <strong>AT</strong> her food, keeping her <em>MOUTH</em> as tiny as a sparrow&#039;s beak, all the while thinking of herself as a gigantic <em>SOW</em>. [thx CharleyGarrett].

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 15-3-2010(3): The <em>mouth</em> of a <em>sow</em> cannot<strong> peck at</strong> things. That&#039;s what birds do.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Corodon">Corodon</a>] 28-11-2011(1): The <em>mouth</em> of the <em>sow</em> <strong>pecks at</strong> food. She&#039;s tired of being called a fat pig, and wants to lose weight.
