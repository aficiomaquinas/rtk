1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(33): Beings <em>exit</em> the spirit world through the <em>altar</em> when you<strong> cast a spell</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 23-1-2009(7): SPOILER: The trophy in the Triwizard Tournament was just for <em>show</em>, in reality Barty Crouch Jr. had<strong> cast a spell</strong> on the trophy so it would be a Portkey that would make anyone who touched it <em>exit</em> the school grounds and teleport to the graveyard where Voldemort was waiting.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 6-4-2010(5): A spirit tried to <em>exit</em> the <em>altar</em> to our world, but I<strong> cast a spell</strong> on his unworldly ass and sent him back to whatever dimension it was he came from.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 14-5-2012(4): &quot;haunt&quot; or &quot;haunted&quot; seems a better keyword. (&quot;curse&quot; is already used.) Story: That place is so <strong>haunted</strong> there&#039;s an <em>exit</em> sign over the <em>altar</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 10-3-2010(1): The congregation sat in church, bored by the priest giving his sermon from the <em>altar</em>. A witch was hiding in the congregation, to appear as a normal human, but because everyone was bored she decided to<strong> cast a spell</strong>, whereby she made the <em>EXIT</em> sign above the <em>altar</em> flicker and change colour. (<em>Exit</em> signs are required in all churches now, for occupational health and safety reasons.).
