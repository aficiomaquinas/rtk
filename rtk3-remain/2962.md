1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(13): To cut down on カロries, the <em>king</em> <em>adds</em> a<strong> jeweled hairpin</strong> to his coffee rather than sugar.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 1-8-2010(12): This and <a href="../v4/2963">beaded hairpin</a> (#2963 琲) only seem to occur in the word 珈琲 (コーヒー) where they are used phonetically. So, in practice, it might be easier to remember them as a pair and not worry about their literal meanings. STORY: For 珈 : An assassin <em>adds</em> poison to the <em>king</em>&#039;s <strong>coffee</strong>. For 琲 : However, fearing a plot against him, the <em>king</em>, summons a hapless convict from a <em>jail cell</em> to sample the <strong>coffee</strong> first.

STORIES: 珈 The servant <em>added</em> <strong>coffee creamer</strong> to the <em>King</em>&#039;s coffee. 琲 The <em>King</em> likes his <strong>coffee</strong> black, so the servant went to <em>jail</em>.
