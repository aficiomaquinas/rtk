3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 24-4-2008(15): The famed <strong>Ho-oh</strong> rides the wind above all other birds. 鳳 appears to refer to the male bird, while 凰 refers to the female, presumably one whose beauty is coveted by emperors. (The generic word Ho-oh is the compound 鳳凰 . Note that technically this is not the<strong> Phoenix</strong> but shares some similarities.).
