## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 4-7-2008(30): <em>Spiderman</em> is put in a <em>jail cell</em> by the fashion police for wearing<strong> scarlet</strong>. (His fellow inmates include<strong> Scarlet</strong> O&#039;Hara,<strong> Scarlet</strong>t Johansson, Captain<strong> Scarlet</strong>, The<strong> Scarlet</strong> Pimpernel, etc).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtcamero">dtcamero</a>] 24-3-2011(7): Without his<strong> SCARLET</strong> threads, peter parker is UN-SPIDERMAN...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 18-7-2007(2): Frankly <strong>Scarlet</strong>, I don&#039;t give a damn. Here we see <strong>Scarlet</strong> O&#039;Hara going to visit Rhett in his <em>jail</em> cell (damn those yankees!) wearing her new (green, and velvet incidentally) <em>threads</em>, created from Tara&#039;s (the manor) drapes.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 15-7-2010(1): The<strong> SCARLET</strong> <em>THREAD</em> woven right into her clothes in the shape of a letter &quot;A&quot; isolates her as effectively as any <em>JAIL CELL</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 8-1-2010(1): <em>Spiderman</em> is finally put in <em>jail</em> for all the damage he&#039;s caused to Forest Hills, New York. Without his<strong> scarlet</strong> suit however, he&#039;s not feeling so confident... especially with that big black guy looking at him.
