## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 17-4-2007(63): Remember that sordid <a href="../v4/959.html">affair</a> (#959 件) when <em>Mr. T</em> was caught having relations with a cow? Well, some months later the heifer drops off the <em>child</em> at T&#039;s place. Does <em>Mr. T</em> share responsibility for his<strong> animal offspring</strong>?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 3-10-2007(4): <em>Mr T</em>, the vet, is helping the mare give birth. Except,<strong> animal offspring</strong> doesn&#039;t but out. A <em>child</em> does instead! Ewww, someone in the villiage has been behaving badly.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 28-4-2007(2): It is amazing to watch <strong>animal offspring</strong> when they first encounter <em>Mr. T</em>. You expect them to be afraid of him, but just like most <em>children</em>, <strong>animal offspring</strong> see him as very easy to like.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hanamijin">hanamijin</a>] 17-7-2010(1): <a href="midori://search?text=「し」虫">「し」虫</a> 仔虫 しちゅう　larva　[Animal offspring: person, child. The child, or more precisely, the<strong> animal offspring</strong> of Mr. T and the cow he had this affair with.].

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 12-3-2010(1): I have a story but it&#039;s a teensy bit racist...
