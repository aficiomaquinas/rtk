## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 15-4-2008(31): My friend&#039;s new dangly <em>ear</em>rings are interesting--<em>cacti</em><strong> strung together</strong> with butterfly <em>cocoons</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 4-1-2010(4): <strong>Strung together</strong>, with no ears to hear for predators, the cocoons rest on the cacti for safety.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 18-8-2011(3): 聯邦 =連邦, 聯盟 =連盟, 聯合 =連合, 連合艦隊 =聯合艦隊 <a href="../v4/2676">strung together</a> (#2676 聯) レン( 連 ) ... Parts: 耳 , 幺, 幺, Cactus (cf 滋賀県 <a href="../v4/1388">nourishing</a> (#1388 滋), 慈しむ <a href="../v4/1389">mercy</a> (#1389 慈), 關東軍 (Kwantung Army)<a href="../v4/38364">Unicode-0x95dc</a> (#38364 關)) ... Note: <strong>old alternate version of modern 連 <a href="../v4/287">take along</a> (#287 連)</strong> ... Story: When the <em>Doubly mysterious</em> man took off his hats, I could see his large <em>Ears</em> and his <em>Cactus</em> legs. He lost a bunch of weight recently so his 4X size pants are now <em>4Y</em> and have to be <strong>Strung Together</strong> tightly to keep from fallling down.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 1-1-2009(2): I picture a bunch of ears<strong> strung together</strong> on a string hung on a cactus that&#039;s got two cocoons on top of it. Weird image but I can&#039;t think of anything better.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 13-1-2011(1): The criminal refused to be taken along 連 by the police．He just put his hands on his <em>ears</em> and shouted: &quot;I can&#039;t hear you!&quot; over and over. &quot;We&#039;ll have to do this the old fashioned way 聯 ,&quot; said the police officer. Two <em>cocoons</em> were then shoved in the man&#039;s mouth to shut him up and he and the police car were<strong> strung together</strong>. They dragged him across a desert and over many spiky <em>cacti</em>. &quot;Should have just been taken along 連 , wise guy.&quot;.
