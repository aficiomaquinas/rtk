1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 3-11-2009(28): Sending mail to the <em>sun</em>. It would take a whole <em>box of stamps</em> to<strong> elevate</strong> it that high.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 6-6-2007(21): A <em>sunny day</em> to a depressed person is just like a <em>box of stamps</em> to a stamp otaku: both have the ability to<strong> elevate</strong> spirits!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 12-11-2010(6): This is kind of odd, but it works for me. The <em>sun</em> has stopped working, so we put it in a <em>box</em>, put some postal <em>stamps</em> on it, and send it up an <strong>elevator</strong> to God in hopes that he will fix it soon.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 30-10-2010(3): 昂騰 =高騰, 昂る , 昂揚 =高揚, 昂奮 =興奮<a href="../v4/2449">elevate</a> (#2449 昂) コウ, たかぶる ... Parts: 昴 -ノ...OR 日 , 卯 -ノ (cf: 抑える , 昴 ) ... Note: Often replaced by 興 or 高 ... Story: You have to truly<strong> Elevate</strong> to rip the ear off the <em>Japanese Sign of the Hare</em>, that great 昴 <a href="../v4/2435">overarching</a> (#2435 昴) sign that is spread over Japan, Like Michael Jordan in the Space Jam movie, skying up to rip the ear of the Bugs Bunny on the movie banner.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 22-1-2009(2): <strong>Elevate</strong> the STAMP out of the BOX and put it up to the SUN to see if is a collector&#039;s item.
