## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kazelee">kazelee</a>] 4-9-2008(51): On the<strong> first day of the month</strong> a mountain goat lets out a &quot;Baah&quot; as it jumps over the moon.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 17-3-2008(21): The female <em>mountain goat</em> can only give milk on one day of the <em>month</em>: on the<strong> first day of the month</strong>. Her milk cycles are controlled by the <em>moon</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Machine_Gun_Cat">Machine_Gun_Cat</a>] 27-8-2009(17): Ｗerewolves turn into wolves at the full moon, Weregoats turn into goats on the<strong> first day of the month</strong>.( primitave= Weregoat).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr">stehr</a>] 3-12-2007(6): Because they couldn&#039;t fit the <em>mountain goat</em> into any of the weekdays they reserved him a character for the<strong> first day of the month</strong>, also because this day is when the <em>moon</em> most closely resembles a <em>mountain-goat&#039;s</em> curved horns. also see <a href="../v4/1960.html">model</a> (#1960 塑).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 20-7-2007(5): Aside from there being a <em>moon</em> up there in the sky, it&#039;s fairly easy to tell that it&#039;s the<strong> first day of the month</strong> when it&#039;s often accompanied by the <em>flesh</em> of a <em>mountain goat</em> on my porch.
