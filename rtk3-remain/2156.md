## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 15-2-2007(57): <em>Each</em> time I see this kanji I<strong> reprehend</strong> the <em>person</em> primitive for knocking the <em>each</em> primitive out of shape.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 24-4-2007(15): You only <strong>reprehend</strong> him because he is reprehensible! He <em>walks around</em> kicking <em>people</em>, like he wants to dispose of them. And that&#039;s all on top of having a big <em>mouth</em>. Reprehensible! Of course you must be the one to <strong>reprehend</strong> him.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 14-10-2008(5): You<strong> reprehend</strong> the <em>person</em> butting in and messing you up <em>each</em> time you try to write a kanji.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko">Nuriko</a>] 7-5-2011(1): Suggested alternative keyword: nit-pick. &quot;Quick nitpicking each and every person last person you meet!&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 22-1-2011(1): Here we have a person opening their mouth and getting <strong>reprimand</strong>ed with a swift kick in the butt (top part of kanji). I like this keyword better because I know the English word much better.
