1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 7-4-2007(71): Those two tourists from my tour group don&#039;t have a<strong> whit</strong> of common sense. They never <em>stop and sit down</em> when the tour guide tells them to!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 16-9-2007(16): <em>Two</em>-year-olds don&#039;t have a<strong> whit</strong> of interest to <em>stop and sit down</em>. They&#039;d likely explode with all that energy.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 6-1-2007(8): Also means &quot;just a little bit&quot;, so I won&#039;t care about positive/negative here. As the turkey is being chased after when it&#039;s fleeing to the safety of the fort, a tracker notices that the footprints are a<strong> whit</strong> ( 些か ) peculiar, and realizes that there are actually two turkeys, one walking on another&#039;s footprints. A truly small ( 本の些細な ) mistake.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 6-5-2011(6): <em>This here</em>? I don&#039;t give a<strong> whit</strong> about it..No, I don&#039;t give <em>two</em><strong> whit</strong>s about it!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 25-1-2009(5): THIS HERE are TWO small<strong> whit</strong> tits, says my TOUR GUIDE, when she shows me them.
