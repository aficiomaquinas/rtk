1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 7-10-2007(35): Jimi Hendrix works as a <em>weather</em> forcaster in his <em>spare time</em>. Today he predicts a (purple)<strong> haze</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cb4960">cb4960</a>] 7-2-2009(24): What a coincidence that work should give me <em>time off</em> only days that have <em>rain</em> or <strong>haze</strong> but no sun.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 2-6-2008(8): Rain, spare time: His <em>hobby</em> is jogging. As he crosses the hills surrounding Kyoto, he can see a<strong> haze</strong> hanging around the city. &quot;Well, let&#039;s hope it <em>rains</em> soon. That damn smog is bad for my health!&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 14-3-2010(5): My <em>hobby</em> is landscape photography so I don&#039;t like it when the <em>weather</em> is <strong>hazy</strong>. Note: <a href="../v4/1882">spare time</a> (#1882 暇) 暇 - 日 = 叚 so I suppose <em>hobby</em> is a diminutive of <em>spare time</em>. [叚 = <a href="../v4/21466">Unicode-0x53da</a> (#21466 叚)].

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 19-1-2009(5): What a coincidence that work should give me <em>time off</em> only days that have <em>rain</em> or<strong> haze</strong> but no sun.
