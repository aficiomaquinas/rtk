1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 7-10-2007(31): I enter a <em>ballot</em> to try to win a <em>melon</em>, but end up with a<strong> gourd</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(8): With its protective hard rind, a<strong> gourd</strong> is a <em>melon</em> used to deposit <em>ballots</em> in during elections.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 17-3-2010(4): <em>Melons</em> didn&#039;t like being classed botanically as<strong> gourd</strong>s so they had a <em>ballot</em> to change their status.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 10-3-2009(2): I cast my <em>ballot</em> for the girl with the biggest <em>melons</em>, but that <strong>gourd</strong>-awful woman with the beard won. (Hey, I couldn&#039;t think of anything either.).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 14-7-2011(1): FOLLOW THE<strong> GOURD</strong>! NO, FOLLOW THE MELON!! I guess we&#039;ll have to have a <em>ballot</em> to decide which one to make our messiah... If you don&#039;t get it, watch the following.
