## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(75): If <em>water completely</em> covers the <em>floor</em>, you will need a<strong> helping hand</strong> to clean it up.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 25-3-2008(26): <em>Water</em> is <em>completely</em> covering your <em>floor</em>, and no matter how fast you mop it up it makes no difference. In desperation you cry, &quot;Can someone give me a<strong> helping hand</strong>?&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Earthlark">Earthlark</a>] 16-8-2010(5): I slipped the <em>floor</em>, which was <em>completely</em> covered by <em>water</em>, but someone lent me a<strong> helping hand</strong>........................................................................... <a href="http://gfcmonica29.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/helping-hand-21.jpg">http://gfcmonica29.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/helping-hand-21.jpg</a>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/megaboyx">megaboyx</a>] 27-7-2010(): OH no, after <em>steaming</em> the vegetables you remove them and turn off the fire but you need a<strong> helping hand</strong> to get rid of all the <em>water</em> completely covering the floor! What a mess, hand me a mop or something. <strong>(JOU,SHOU - suk.u,tasu.keru)</strong> NAMES susumu/JOU/SUKE 丞相 【じょうしょう】 prime minister (in ancient China).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormraven">Stormraven</a>] 20-6-2012(): <em>Water</em> is <em>completely</em> covering the <em>floor</em>. You&#039;re going to need a<strong> helping hand</strong> to clean it up. So of course you conjure one made <em>completely</em> out of the <em>water</em> all over the <em>floor</em>, and it gets to work. Very fitting, that the<strong> helping hand</strong> you need is made out of the very problem it&#039;s meant to resolve.
