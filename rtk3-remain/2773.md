## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Crowfoot">Crowfoot</a>] 19-4-2008(46): On the <em>St. Bernard assembly line</em>, the dogs pass by and the workers clip their fur with <em>metal</em><strong> scissors</strong>.

Story:Easiest to see this as the Metal that does the 挟む <a href="../v4/1267">sandwiched</a> (#1267 挟), but written with the old version of<strong> Scissors</strong> 挾=挟 Compare to 來, the old version of 来 <a href="../v4/1884">come</a> (#1884 来) ( 倖田來未 ) , Assembly line is replaced by a line and a ten-ten. This also gives you the reading of both.
