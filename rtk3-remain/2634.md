1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 17-3-2008(26): If I have any <em>bamboo</em> shoots left over from my stirfry I wrap them up in <em>foil</em> to keep them moist <em>overnight</em>. Then I can use them the next day.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 9-2-2007(8): I always roll up my<strong> foil</strong> and hide it in sticks of <em>bamboo overnight</em>. This is to<strong> foil</strong> any attempt to steal it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr">stehr</a>] 6-7-2008(4): Imagine staying in a <em>bamboo</em> forest <em>overnight</em> with only one of those thin,<strong> foil</strong> survival blankets to keep warm. <a href="http://www.lasoutdoors.com/images/CS02-Reflective-Survival-bl.JPG">http://www.lasoutdoors.com/images/CS02-Reflective-Survival-bl.JPG</a>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 7-8-2008(2): Mirrors are way played out - I keep it grimy with mine, and do my <em>cocaine</em> off of some<strong> foil</strong>. It&#039;s easier to carry with me when I go to stay <em>overnight</em> at a friend&#039;s (just ball it up in your pocket!), and it&#039;s not suspicious at all. I mean, come on. Imagine getting caught with <em>coke</em>, a mirror, and a razor - too obvious. But if you use<strong> foil</strong>, and divide your lines with a bit of <em>bamboo</em> and get caught with all that, you might get off with the &quot;my friend asked me to hold this for him&quot; excuse.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/juandixonformvp">juandixonformvp</a>] 23-9-2012(1): People wrapped food in bamboo leaves to keep it overnight, now we just use<strong> foil</strong>.
