1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 18-7-2007(34): &quot;Dude! What happened to your <em>chin</em>?&quot; &quot;Well, I was out <em>fishing</em>...&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 31-8-2007(14): Saltwater <strong>crocs</strong> swim in the sea like <em>fish</em>. Right side = <em>crocodile</em> primative. Pictograph - 2 big eyes and <em>one</em> massive <em>snare</em> for a mouth.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 3-9-2008(4): (This is pictographic cheating, but I think Heisig would approve.) The upper right is a CAJUN&#039;s two eyes and his mouth, licking his lips. He&#039;s set a SNARE out in the bayou, for the one delicacy he loves more than FISH-- the fearsome<strong> alligator</strong>! He can&#039;t wait to catch one and make a fine sauce piquant!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/melchan">melchan</a>] 3-10-2009(2): The right side looks like a pictograph of an<strong> alligator</strong> with its two eyes (the <em>mouths</em>), and <em>one</em> <em>snare</em> mouth waiting the unaware <em>fishes</em> to go inside.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 9-10-2011(1): 鰐 , 鰐梨 =ワニナシ=アボカド, 鰐淵寺 , <a href="../v4/2824">alligator</a> (#2824 鰐)ガク, わに ... Parts: 魚 , 咢 (cf 咢<a href="../v4/21666">Unicode-0x54a2</a> (#21666 咢), 顎 <a href="../v4/2795">chin</a> (#2795 顎), 驚愕 <a href="../v4/24853">Unicode-0x6115</a> (#24853 愕)) ... Story: An<strong> Alligator</strong> eats many <em>Fish</em>, by opening his<strong> Alligator</strong> jaw, but leaving his <em>Chin</em>(咢) in place.
