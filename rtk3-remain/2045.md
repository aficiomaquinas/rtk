2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enryu">enryu</a>] 24-8-2009(22): (Grammar and story adjustment from astridtops story) You STOP AND SIT DOWN to listen to the tour guides story. &quot;These STONES are remnants of what used to be a<strong> fort</strong> long ago, but the enemy came and tore the place down. It has never been rebuilt&quot;.
