1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 29-7-2009(28): <strong>Malt</strong> made from <em>barley</em> is often <em>bound up</em> with <em>rice</em> for brewing.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 2-3-2010(10): This means kouji mould, so I think <strong>malt</strong> is a poor keyword. Sake, shochu and other East Asian spirits use this mould in place of yeast, which is used to make most other alcoholic spirits in the world. Mould and yeast are two different types of fungus. <strong>Yeast</strong> might have been a better keyword, as it is the organism doing the fermenting. Story: <strong>Kouji mould</strong> is grown on <em>rice specially bound up</em> to form a starter culture. To make <em>mugi</em>shochu, the starter culture is added to a <em>barley</em> mash.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 16-3-2011(2): I&#039;m making my own special brew with <strong>Kouji Mold</strong>, barley, and some Chrysanthemum buds to add a floral aroma. Notice I&#039;m not adding the actual flowers, just the buds. Otherwise things would taste too leafy.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 15-3-2010(1): This kanji refers to こうじ which is a preparation of grain such as <em>barley</em> or <em>rice</em> fermented by combining (<em>binding</em>) it up with a mould. The mould converts the grain starch to sugar and grain sugar is<strong> malt</strong>. Note: Kouji is used for making sake, shouyu and miso.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 9-6-2008(): This<strong> malt</strong> is no good! Some incompetent <em>bound up</em> some <em>rice</em>, which germinated with the <em>barley</em>.
