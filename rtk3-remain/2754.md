## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(21): A<strong> button</strong> is <em>metal</em> that requires an <em>opening</em> in order to function.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 21-4-2009(12): A shirt in the clothes shop has<strong> button</strong>s of solid <em>gold</em>, so you bite them off and try to smuggle them out hidden in your <em>mouth</em>. (Note: Main use of 釦 <strong>is</strong> for clothing, although katakana ボタン is more common.).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 29-11-2008(6): Once you can get the <em>metal</em><strong> button</strong> through the <em>mouth</em>, it&#039;s fastened.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hknamida">hknamida</a>] 21-1-2008(4): To stop people from stealing your precious <em>metal</em><strong> button</strong>s, you keep them in your <em>mouth</em>. Alas, they&#039;re made of lead, and you die. :-(.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 17-5-2009(2): The kanji is supposedly only used for push-buttons, not clothing kind which are just ボタン. So I picture an elaborately designed doorbell<strong> button</strong> inside the mouth of a metal lion attached to the side of the door.
