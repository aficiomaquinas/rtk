1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 28-11-2006(39): Spending the <em>day</em> with your <em>eye</em> on your <em>crotch</em> as you meditate on the<strong> mandala</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 28-2-2008(17): Citing my story for <a href="../v4/829">ridicule</a> (#829 慢): &quot;It&#039;s clearly an Indian<strong> mandala</strong>, with the Buddha <em>sitting cross-legged</em>, <em>eyes</em> closed as in trance, beneath the <em>sun</em>, a symbol of the enlightenment which one can reach by practicing His teachings.&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eatyoda">eatyoda</a>] 10-12-2008(9): Same as primitive: a<strong> mandala</strong> has three circles centering on one point. The outer circle is the <em>sun</em> which represents the spiritual, what we can&#039;t comprehend; the middle is the <em>eye</em> which represents the feelings of man; the inner is a <em>crotch</em> that represents our carnal instincts.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 15-1-2008(8): <a href="Http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala">Http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala</a> People usually mediate with staring at the sun with their eyes, cross (crotch) legged. Here, sun=mandala.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 1-6-2010(7): The<strong> mandala</strong> is a graphic representation of the universe: the <em>sun</em> representing the cosmos, the <em>eye</em> represents the human observer, and the <em>crotch</em> represents animal instincts.
