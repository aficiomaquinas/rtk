## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 11-1-2009(57): There are <em>words</em> written on the <em>road</em>, but you have to <strong>crawl</strong> along to read them: &#039;If...you...can...read...this...you...look...silly...&#039;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 6-4-2007(28): Some of those amateur marathon runners at the end seem merely to<strong> crawl</strong> on the <em>road</em> instead of running. They truly need <em>words</em> of encouragement.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hknamida">hknamida</a>] 6-1-2008(9): <em>Socrates</em>, unused to running the marathon,<strong> crawl</strong>s pathetically down the <em>road</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LloydGA">LloydGA</a>] 1-7-2008(2): An anti-verbal abuse campaign. Volunteers carry big styrofoam words on their back as they run a marathon to represent the burden placed on children by their verbally abusive parents. Imagine standing at the finish line to see one of the runners<strong> crawl</strong> down the road with your favorite abusive word on his back, panting for breath. (Props to astridtops).
