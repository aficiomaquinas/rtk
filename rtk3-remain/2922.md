You then open your fly and proceed to do a full<strong> transcription</strong> of what it is saying.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 28-5-2009(2): I&#039;ve made <em>7 stops</em> at various transcribers, but they can&#039;t make a<strong> transcription</strong> out of this strange recording; one of them said it sounded like an <em>infant</em> peeing (<em>stream</em>ing)!
