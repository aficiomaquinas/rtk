1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 5-6-2007(37): <strong>Without exception</strong>, the <em>heart</em> of every hunter starts beating like crazy as he comes upon the <em>tracks of an animal</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 22-12-2008(18): If you get addicted to playing <em>dice</em> ( 番 ）<strong>without exception</strong> you will end up losing your <em>rice fields</em> ( 田 ） so take my warning to <em>heart</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 2-8-2009(3): Furries, people whose <em>hearts</em> beat like crazy when they see <em>animal tracks</em>, are despised by all other factions/fandoms<strong> without exception</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 16-9-2008(3): If you look at the footprints of one of those really primitive <em>T-Rex</em>s, you&#039;ll be astounded at how deep it is. But prepare for another astounding fact - each step,<strong> without exception</strong>, marks the loss of one animal&#039;s life (or heart). This is because the <em>T-Rex</em> was such an inefficient animal that it required tons of energy to move - so it needed to kill at least one animal to move one step. So imagine tracking a <em>T-Rex</em> and marking a <em>heart</em> on a chart, and shaking your head at the massive waste of life...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 31-1-2011(1): <strong>Without exception</strong>, all the braves must find the <em>animal tracks</em> then eat the raw <em>heart</em> of the beast in order to become a man. (The nuance of this kanji is &quot;all&quot;).
