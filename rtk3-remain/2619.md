## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 11-12-2008(33): When I hear<strong> rustling</strong> in the night I <em>stand up</em> and go to check out what it is but it&#039;s always just <em>wind</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 25-5-2008(9): Vase, wind (with gnats): He heard a<strong> rustling</strong> outside and when he checked, saw a host of killer gnats riding the <em>wind</em> in the direction of his house. He quickly jumped into the large standing <em>vase</em> and put the stopper in, to ride it out...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 6-3-2010(2): Just as holding a shell to your ear gives the sound of the sea, doing likewise with a <em>vase</em> gives the<strong> rustling</strong> of the <em>wind</em>. Note: To remember to use 風 instead of &quot;empty&quot; 几 -<strong> Rustling</strong> suggests a FULLER sound involving leaves, branches etc.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 19-2-2007(2): The kidnappers locked him up in a big <em>vase</em>, and he didn&#039;t know where he was. But from the<strong> rustling</strong> noises of the <em>wind</em>, he determined he must be outside somewhere.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/marcmiddag">marcmiddag</a>] 17-8-2011(1): (thanks cameron_en) But I prefer the keyword &quot;suddenly&quot;! When I suddenly! hear<strong> rustling</strong> in the night I stand up and go to check out what it is but it&#039;s always just wind. さっと 【 颯と · 颯っと irregular】quickly (esp. actions) —Usually written using kana alone.
