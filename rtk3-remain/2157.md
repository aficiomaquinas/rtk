## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 1-6-2007(51): If someone&#039;s<strong> whisper</strong>ing you&#039;d need three ears close to his mouth to be able to hear it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 22-7-2009(43): It&#039;s funny how if I just talk, no one listens, but if I<strong> whisper</strong>, <em>many ears</em> are eager to hear what&#039;s coming from my <em>mouth</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 29-4-2006(10): People are curious beasts. If you<strong> whisper</strong> something out of your mouth, there will be many ears listening. Or alternatively, think in terms of power levels: In kanjis, the same element can appear in groups of 1-3. Here we see mouth power level dropped to the minimum (whisper), which means that ear power level has to be raised to the maximum. (like mobile phones, which need more power when the bars indicating signal strength drop).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 29-6-2009(7): What <em>one mouth</em><strong> whisper</strong>s, <em>three ears</em> will overhear...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/delenir">delenir</a>] 4-6-2012(1): You would need 3 ears to hear a<strong> whisper</strong>.
