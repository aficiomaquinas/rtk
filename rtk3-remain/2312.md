1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 4-5-2007(36): These <em>spikes</em> mark the water&#039;s edge in ancient times. Notice that the <em>water</em> level is actually much lower today.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hknamida">hknamida</a>] 1-1-2008(14): The water&#039;s edge is firmly nailed to the ground with robust <em>spikes</em>... through the <em>water</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Apple_Head">Apple_Head</a>] 7-11-2009(5): If you follow <em>Water Street</em>, it&#039;ll take you right to Water&#039;s Edge. That&#039;s why it&#039;s called <em>Water Street</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 31-8-2009(3): If the water&#039;s edge goes past this <em>nail</em>, we are all screwed.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sam79">Sam79</a>] 27-12-2011(1): To keep the water smooth at all times, nail the water&#039;s edge firmly in place. Somehow this does not seem to work out, drops of water splash even as I drive in the spike, this kanji is a pictograph for my failed atempt.
