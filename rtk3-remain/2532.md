3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 13-3-2010(10): This kanji 樒 (しきみ・しきび) refers to Japanese<strong> star-anise</strong>. Its evergreen branches are popular for placing at graves. It’s very poisonous. The edible spice of the same name 八角 (はっかく) is from the closely related Chinese<strong> star-anise</strong> 大茴香 (ダイウイキョウ). Both species produce almost identical fruits. STORY: A batch of Chinese<strong> star-anise</strong> was adulterated with its poisonous Japanese namesake. Great <em>secrecy</em> surrounds the incident. Was it an innocent <em>tree</em> mixup or coverup?
