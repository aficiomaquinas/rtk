## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 31-1-2007(31): It really<strong> elude</strong>s me why we have two kanji with the same keyword... this one and <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1973">deviate/elude</a> (#1973 逸). But lets intertwine their stories: The rabbit, who<strong> elude</strong>d capture (<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1973">deviate/elude</a> (#1973 逸)) on the <em>road</em>, was finally caught when someone threw a <em>shield</em> over it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 8-5-2008(14): The Spartan had to block the <em>road</em> to stop the advancing enemy army, but he tried to <strong>shirk</strong> his duty and threw away his <em>shield</em>. That&#039;s suicide.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 23-3-2010(10): With <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1973">deviate/elude</a> (#1973 逸) already taken, Heisig changed the keyword for this one to <strong>shirk</strong> (= <strong>elude</strong> responsibility) in the 2nd edition. [from Corodon] STORY: Imagine a pre-battle speech, &quot;Down that <em>road</em> lies the enemy, raise your <em>shields</em> and do not <strong>shirk</strong> (<strong>elude</strong> your responsibility)&quot;. You can imagine the rest... &quot;If you find yourself alone... riding in green fields with the sun on your face. Do not be troubled... for you are in Elysium, and you&#039;re already dead!&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 28-12-2009(6): Could fabrice change the damn keyword to <strong>shirk</strong> already?

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 12-4-2012(3): Roman legions used to form an impenetrable formation called the testudo, where their <em>shields</em> were held together like a tortoise&#039;s shell, protecting them from arrows and spears as they marched along the <em>road</em>. It was thus imperative that none of the soldiers <strong>shirk</strong> his duty, because if just one <em>shield</em> was not held firmly in place, flaming projectiles could enter and destroy the formation. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File</a>:Testudo_formation.jpg.
