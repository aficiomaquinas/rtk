## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 13-6-2008(22): The church<strong> carillion</strong> was composed of <em>metal</em> bells that informed when it was the <em>correct</em> time to go to church.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 22-1-2009(13): Wtf is a<strong> carillion</strong>? How about &quot;gong&quot; instead. Picture a game show where they bang on the gong every time you get the correct answer. Or, if you want to go with the book explanation,<strong> carillion</strong> is the &quot;western&quot; bell which is struck from the inside rather than outside. Story: just like everything else in the East (writing, utensils, etc) bells are harder to work than necessary, being hit from the outside and all. The correct way is to put the gong on the inside, makes it so much easier.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 29-11-2008(7): &quot;How much do you think this <em>gold</em> [carillion] is worth?&quot; &quot;Hmm.. a<strong> carillion</strong> dollars?&quot; &quot;<em>Correct!</em>&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 2-10-2009(5): The correct spelling is <strong>Carillon</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 13-1-2010(2): The Western bell, made of METAL and with the CORRECT spelling of CARILLON was used to notify people of various events (war, storms, fire, etc) so they could respond CORRECTLY.
