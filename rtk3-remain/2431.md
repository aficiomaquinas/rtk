5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 13-8-2008(2): This is an old Japanese metaphor for something that happens<strong> instantaneously</strong> - &quot;the time it takes for your <em>heart</em> to <em>knot</em>&quot; (the un<em>knot</em>ing is implied here). In other words, the time it takes for your <em>heart</em> to beat.<strong> Instantaneously</strong> - in a <em>heart</em>beat.
