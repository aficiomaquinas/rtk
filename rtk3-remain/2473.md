Then I thought &#039;how am I gonna find it later?&#039; So I painted the <strong>willow purple</strong>. &#039;Wait a sec, now everyone&#039;s gonna be able to find it!&quot; So I painted all the other willows purple as well. Now I&#039;m in trouble...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 20-6-2007(11): Normally, I can resist the cries of a weeping willow, but this one, she was a<strong> purple willow</strong>! I just couldn&#039;t let the poor <em>tree</em> sit there, so I gave her my <em>piggy bank</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 27-2-2010(1): There was once a credit card called Access with the slogan &quot;Your flexible friend&quot;. Willow wood is noted for being very flexible. This is why willow is the wood of choice for piggy banks.<strong> Purple willow</strong> <em>wood piggy banks</em> are the best because they change colour depending on your financial state be it &quot;in the red&quot; or &quot;in the black&quot;. When you use it for the first time, it is neither red nor black but some colour in between i.e. purple.
