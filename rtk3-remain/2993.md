## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 14-6-2008(25): Old evil altar, chihuahua with extra leg: They opened up the <em>old evil altar</em> in the ancient temple. Nothing inside. But suddenly, their <em>chihuahua</em> grew an extra leg, and started speaking in a strange language. Time for an<strong> exorcism</strong>, one would say.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 5-12-2009(8): When grandma&#039;s <em>chihuahua</em> developed the <em>extra leg</em> we thought an<strong> exorcism</strong> in order. We did it on a <em>very old altar</em>. It was not successful.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 4-2-2008(3): A <em>three-legged dog</em> has an<strong> exorcism</strong> performed on a <em>cheap resin altar</em> (see 祀 <a href="../v4/2992">enshrine</a> (#2992 祀)). Note that the right-hand half of this character is the simplified Chinese form of &quot;dragon&quot; (犮, instead of 竜 in Japanese).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(2): Your <em>friend</em>, barking like a <em>dog</em>, is put on the <em>altar</em> for an<strong> exorcism</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 4-3-2011(1): Back in the <em>[old]</em> days, before they knew about the birds and the bees, they put the poor little <em>chihuahua</em> on the <em>altar</em> (note [old]), and did an<strong> exorcism</strong> on his <em>third leg</em>.
