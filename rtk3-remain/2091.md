## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(46): <strong>A certain</strong> drunken <em>mouth</em> is on the <em>floor</em> at the <em>fiesta</em> moaning &quot;<strong>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</strong>&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 20-9-2007(17): A is an indefinate article alright. At this <em>fiesta</em>, the band wern&#039;t the genuine article either. So the patrons threw them off the stage (&quot;Aaaaaa!&quot;) and pressed their <em>mouthes</em> against the <em>floor</em>. &quot;Sing no more you talentless hacks!!&#039;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KristinHolly">KristinHolly</a>] 9-1-2009(9): The cowboy who came back from the range and beguiled all the hearts at the fiesta -- when the fiesta winds down, he&#039;s just a big mouth out on the floor. The girls whose hearts were beguiled before are gone now, having realized the truth: this isn&#039;t &quot;the&quot; cowboy, it&#039;s just <strong>&quot;a&quot;</strong> cowboy.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 27-4-2009(8): On the morning of your exam, you wake up <em>mouth</em> to the <em>floor</em> amongst the aftermath of last night&#039;s <em>fiesta</em>. You wipe the drool from your face, stand up and grab your school bag. You aren&#039;t getting an <strong>A</strong> today - that&#039;s for sure.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Betadel">Betadel</a>] 27-12-2010(4): <em>A certain</em> passed out Index. She has her <em>mouth</em> on the <em>floor</em> at the <em>fiesta</em>, mumbling &quot;Tou~maaa&quot;. Too much alcohol for the little nun.
