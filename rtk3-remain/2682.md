## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 29-6-2007(37): The<strong> crab</strong> isn’t truly an <em>insect</em>, but certainly looks like one. They’re real tasty, too, but you have to <em>unravel</em> it if you want to eat it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 28-7-2009(12): You <em>unravel</em> a<strong> crab</strong> leg, but <em>insects</em> fall out of it. It&#039;s probably too old to be edible.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Evangelo">Evangelo</a>] 12-12-2009(6): Fun fact about this kanji: In Ancient China, they used the parts 解 and 虫 because a<strong> Crab</strong>&#039;s legs were easy to take apart ( 分解しやすい ).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 28-10-2010(3): A<strong> crab</strong> must be <em>unraveled</em> to partake of it but some people don&#039;t like them because they look like <em>insects</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 7-3-2011(2): It took them a while to <em>unravel</em> the genus of the<strong> crab</strong>, but eventually everyone agreed that it was not an <em>insect</em>.
