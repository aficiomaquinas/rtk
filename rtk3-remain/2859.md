1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 3-10-2009(15): A <em>scarecrow</em><strong> bemoan</strong>s that it <em>lacks</em> legs.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 13-8-2009(13): (I use &quot;kanji&quot; for the scarecrow primitive.) I<strong> bemoan</strong> the huge number of <em>kanji</em> I must memorize, but I plod on despite my tired <em>yawn</em>s.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-7-2009(13): <em>Audrey II</em> <em>yawns</em>,<strong> bemoan</strong>ing being stuck in the flower shop with nothing to eat.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 12-12-2008(4): <strong>Grief;<strong> bemoan</strong>; lamentation.</strong> The <em>scarecrow</em> is made from <em>grass</em>; and he has a <em>big mouth</em> and arms made of a <em>stick</em>. He <em>lacks</em> human characteristics. This is the source of his <strong>grief</strong> and <strong>lamentation</strong>; he <strong>bemoans</strong> his lack of humanity. When you feel like lamenting or <strong>bemoaning</strong> your fate; think of the poor <em>scarecrow</em> who <em>lacks</em> humanity, but wants it so desparately.
