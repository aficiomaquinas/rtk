Well, I&#039;m <em>happy</em>, my <em>belly</em>&#039;s round, <em>my band</em> just played a sellout show for the ladybirds (and oh yeah, there were groupies, lemme tell ya)... now it&#039;s time for THIS <em>insect</em> to go into<strong> hibernation</strong>. Scientists call it diapause. Rock.&quot;.
