## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 8-6-2008(22): Grow late, life: It had nearly <em>grown too late</em> to<strong> resucitate</strong> the half-drowned man, but a passer-by was able to breath <em>life</em> back into him, thus <strong>resucitating</strong> him.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(10): To breathe <em>life</em> into someone after it might have <em>grown (too) late</em> is to <strong>resuscitate</strong> them.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shakunatz">Shakunatz</a>] 10-2-2011(4): <a href="http://google.com/#q=蘇る：死んだものが蘇る。">蘇る：死んだものが蘇る。</a> <a href="http://google.com/#q=甦る：衰えたものが甦る。">甦る：衰えたものが甦る。</a> However that&#039;s just a nuance found on the net. Just few dictionaries mentioned it. To breathe life into someone after it might have grown (too) late is to resuscitate them. Edit Mantixen.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jotakami">jotakami</a>] 10-5-2011(2): Just found this kanji while playing FF7: the name of the Revive materia is 甦生 in Japanese. As such, I would replace the keyword with <strong>revive</strong>. And, in any case, it&#039;s misspelled: resu<strong>s</strong>citate.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shrimpster">shrimpster</a>] 28-11-2012(1): For those of you who watch Dexter: It had almost grown too late for young Hannah, but a fisherman jumped in and saved her life by resuscitation while her father stood on the sidelines.
