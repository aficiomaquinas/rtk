1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 31-10-2007(80): The <em>woman</em> removes the <em>two shells</em> covering her breasts (for modesty) and then attaches the<strong> suckling infant</strong>. How very Little Mermaid...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lankydan">lankydan</a>] 13-9-2007(9): I see this as two<strong> suckling infant</strong>s clamped onto their mother (woman) like shellfish when breastfeeding.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 24-7-2009(7): The old form of <a href="../v4/1932">cherry tree</a> (#1932 桜) uses this as the right hand side (i.e. two <em>shellfish</em> instead of <em>owl</em>). Compare 桜 to 櫻. It&#039;s not in RtK3 but it&#039;s still very common - I saw it on a building yesterday. Story: two <em>clams</em> latched onto the <em>woman</em>&#039;s breasts like two<strong> suckling infant</strong>s.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 31-10-2010(2): 嬰児 , 退嬰 , 退嬰的 , <a href="../v4/2193">suckling infant</a> (#2193 嬰)エイ, みどりご ... Parts: 貝 , 貝 , 女 (cf 櫻<a href="../v4/27387">Unicode-0x6afb</a> (#27387 櫻), 鸚 <a href="../v4/2830">parakeet</a> (#2830 鸚) ... Story: Old 桜 is 櫻. In old Japan, the 櫻 was valued for the blossoms and the 鸚哥 singing. In fact the parakeets singing was so loud you could even abandon a <strong>Suckling Infant</strong> in those trees. In fact what with the Cherry blossoms falling, the Parakeets singing and the abandoned<strong> Suckling Infant</strong>s, it was not much a tree anyway.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 15-1-2011(1): The poor <em>woman</em> had two<strong> suckling infant</strong>s. Both her breasts felt like they had two spiky <em>shells</em> attacking them.
