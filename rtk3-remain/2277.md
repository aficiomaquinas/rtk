5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 28-7-2008(3): (cross generation, but who cares) <em>Data</em> finally gets the <em>heart</em> transplant he has been wishing for - now he can feel emotion! The first emotion he feels, though, is<strong> infatuation</strong> for Seven of Nine...he can&#039;t get her out of his <em>heart</em>. It starts to interfere with his work, and he decides that enough is enough. He can&#039;t very well throw away the <em>heart</em> (it would offend the captain), but he has to do something...so he pulls his new <em>heart</em> out of his body, and ties it in a <em>knot</em>. No more<strong> infatuation</strong>.
