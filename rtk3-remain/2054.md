1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 1-12-2008(53): Little known fact: <em>Tom Cruise</em> turns into a merman at night,<strong> scaled</strong> like a <em>fish</em> and everything. Weird.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cb4960">cb4960</a>] 15-10-2007(39): A <strong>scaled</strong> <em>fish</em> goes to a <em>shoeshine</em> place to get his scales shined up to impress the lady fish. (Shoeshines will shine up any type of<strong> scaled</strong> creature, including but not limited to fish and dragons).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 1-11-2007(8): <em>Tom Cruise</em><strong> scaled</strong> down his public display of affection after his appearance on Oprah looked a bit <em>fishy</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zanzibar">zanzibar</a>] 22-3-2009(5): TOM CRUISE has to wear the<strong> scaled</strong> costume of a FISH for his next role.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 3-3-2008(3): <em>Fish</em> are often served completely whole, head and all, in Japan ... this tends to make trendy <em>Americans in sunglasses</em> squeamish, however, as it makes it plainly obvious that the animal was<strong> scaled</strong>. Chopped up and deep-fried into unrecognizable nuggets ... that&#039;s how we like our meat!
