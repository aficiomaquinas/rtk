## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 18-8-2009(24): I have a huge<strong> conglomerate</strong> (collection) of old books I&#039;m looking to get rid of. They&#039;re not in any particular order... some are <em>upside down in a row</em>, some are <em>soiled</em>... just look through them and <em>take</em> whatever you want.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 14-2-2008(10): This is similar to 業 <a href="../v4/1792">business/profession</a> (#1792 業), with &quot;not yet&quot; replaced by &quot;take.&quot; A giant company that <em>takes</em> up many companies with different <em>professions</em>, is called a <strong>conglomerate</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Crowfoot">Crowfoot</a>] 29-4-2008(3): The <em>upside-down penguins in the back row</em> are causing such a ruckus the performers on stage have to film <em>ten takes</em> of their commercial for the big<strong> conglomerate</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-6-2009(2): Could think of the primitives as <em>upside-down-in-a-row + sheep + take</em> (with some strokes shared). Story: &quot;We<strong> conglomerate</strong> (bunch together) <em>upside-down</em>&quot;, said the <em>sheep</em>, &quot;so that predators don&#039;t <em>take</em> us &quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/EratiK">EratiK</a>] 18-9-2011(1): The word<strong> conglomerate</strong> sounds too economical to me, while <strong>agglomerate</strong> seems broader (since this kanji is also used about bushes or clouds) and more suited as keyword.
