1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 14-11-2008(28): The<strong> bush clover</strong> is a special <em>flower</em> which was dedicated to bush when he won the presidency in <em>Autumn</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(23): <strong>Bush clover</strong> <em>flowers</em> in <em>autumn</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 14-7-2009(13): From the Japanese Wikipedia page for<strong> bush clover</strong>: ハギ（ 萩 ） <a href="http://google.com/#q=とは、マメ科ハギ属の総称。落葉低木。秋の七草のひとつで、花期は">とは、マメ科ハギ属の総称。落葉低木。秋の七草のひとつで、花期は</a> 7 月から 10 <a href="http://google.com/#q=月。">月。</a> So the<strong> bush clover</strong> really does <em>flower</em> in <em>autumn</em>, as suggested by its kanji.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 26-10-2010(3): Like past President Bush,<strong> bush clover</strong> is a little slow. It flowers (blossoms) in fall, after most flowers have died and wilted away.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 10-5-2011(2): People discovered a field in which they were trying to grow <strong>bush clovers</strong>, but instead of growing <em>flowers</em>, they were growing clones of ex-president Bush! Of course, everyone gathered as fast as they could and turned it into a <em>burning field</em> (see my suggestion in frame <a href="../v4/900">autumn</a> (#900 秋)) before it was too late.
