1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 25-6-2007(37): Unsuccessful dieter&#039;s excuse: &quot;If I put anything in my <em>mouth</em>, I <em>immediately</em> put on a<strong> ton</strong>.&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(4): A <em>mouth</em> that says things <em>immediately</em> without thinking gets into a<strong> ton</strong> of trouble.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtcamero">dtcamero</a>] 19-4-2011(3): The character 頓 (IMMEDIATE) is pronounced &quot;トン&quot;. The addition of the MOUTH to the left indicates that it is used for its sound and to convey a meaning other than the normal meaning of the character.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 31-8-2010(1): An <em>earthworm&#039;s head</em> is just a <em>mouth</em> which it uses to create &quot;<strong>ton</strong>nels&quot;. Note: 口 here signals that <em>immediate</em> is being used phonetically giving 口 + 頓 = <a href="http://google.com/#q=噸・トン">噸・トン</a> <strong> ton</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 22-9-2008(1): <em>Immediately</em> after the words left my <em>mouth</em>, the stupidity of what I&#039;d just said hit me like a<strong> ton</strong> of bricks. Very embarrassing.
