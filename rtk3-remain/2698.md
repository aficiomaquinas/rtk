## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 24-7-2007(27): Keeping my <em>eye</em> fixed directly over the paper, I hold down the <em>ivy</em> and melt the strands with my <em>magic wand</em>. Viola,<strong> ruled lines</strong> are created! I bet most people think a machine does it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 1-5-2008(6): The <em>cyclops</em> couldn&#039;t make<strong> ruled lines</strong> with his wooden <em>wand</em> because it wasn&#039;t smooth, so he had to use a <em>square jewel</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 24-2-2010(2): The art gallery curator needed to take his <em>fingers</em> off the painting he was trying to <a href="../v4/674.html">hang</a> (#674 掛), and <em>keep his eye on</em> the<strong> ruled lines</strong> that he&#039;d pencilled in, so he could work out where exactly to place the artwork.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 5-1-2010(2): When practicing kanji I use paper with<strong> RULED LINES</strong> which look kind of like a NET because there are horizontal and vertical lines. These lines would frame a SQUARED JEWEL very nicely. I needed a MAGIC WAND to help me make sense of this kanji.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 16-1-2011(1): A class at hogwarts: The assignment is to make perfectly<strong> ruled lines</strong> of <em>ivy</em> using your <em>wand</em>. One kid has the idea of writing some nasty words with the ivy, but the teacher&#039;s <em>eye</em> is on him.
