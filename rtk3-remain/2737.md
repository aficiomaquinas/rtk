1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(106): You<strong> get</strong> <em>money</em> from the <em>generation</em> above you.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vashbandy">vashbandy</a>] 6-12-2009(18): You<strong> get</strong> the generation above you to give you money. (note: I&#039;ve modified the keyword a bit after having just read &quot;Making Sense of Japanese&quot; because it&#039;s important to me to integrate into もらう the idea that<strong> get</strong>ting in this sense is to <em>get someone else to give it to you</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 1-11-2010(4): 貰う , 貰い手 , 貰い物 , 貰い泣き (Cry in Sympathy), 貰い火 (catch fire from next door)<a href="../v4/2737">get</a> (#2737 貰) もらう ... Parts: 世 , 貝 ... Story: The Kanji makes a point that the keyword does not. In Japanese, the distinction between coming into possesion and someone giving you something is strong. This Kanji uses <em>Generation</em> to indicate that this is not just<strong> Get</strong>ting money, but <strong>Getting someone to give you</strong> some <em>Money</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 26-7-2007(4): <strong><em>GETS!</em></strong> c2003 Sakano Dandy is easily one of the stupidest fads that ever hit Japan. I guess it a <em>generational</em> thing, cuz I still don&#039;t <strong>gets</strong> it. I am sure he managed to <strong>gets</strong> a lot of <em>money</em> while he was at it though.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 16-7-2007(2): After those <em>calms</em> go through the family tree for <em>generations</em> for years on end, I finally<strong> get</strong> it!
