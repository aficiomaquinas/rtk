## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 1-1-2007(25): A<strong> loquat</strong> is a tropical fruit <em>tree</em>, that <em>compared</em> to other trees has an odd seasonal pattern: it&#039;s fruit is ripe in late winter or early spring.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 20-11-2008(17): The<strong> loquat</strong> tree is very rare. To<strong> loquat</strong>e it, you need to <em>compare</em> it to the <em>trees</em> next to it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 15-2-2010(6): If you <em>compare</em> the unusual spelling of this <em>tree</em>&#039;s name to that of another orange fruit, the kumquat, you&#039;ll notice the similarity. This is because the -quat ending comes from the Cantonese pronunciation of the kanji 橘 （<a href="../v4/2494.html">mandarin orange</a> (#2494 橘)）, which is read as <em>gwat1</em>. (This is true.).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 30-10-2009(3): I <em>compare</em> the<strong> loquat</strong> <em>tree</em> to the hiquat <em>tree</em> &amp; decide I prefer the former.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 3-8-2008(1): I&#039;m not sure if you jerks were aware of this, but it is considered extremely rude to touch the <strong>ビワ</strong> fruit (loquat) with your fingers - no ifs, ands, or buts. The traditionally accepted method of harvesting and eating the<strong> loquat</strong> is with two spoons. You hold the <em>two spoons</em> together in one hand to pick it, and you then put the<strong> loquat</strong> in a plate or something and use one spoon to hold it in place, and the other to remove the skin and pit - then you can eat it. Please keep this in mind next time.
