1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 29-9-2007(36): After the revolution, the <em>king</em> was put into a <em>box</em> so that the government could be<strong> set straight</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 16-7-2007(10): Walking through the park, I see many large <em>box</em>es where homeless people live. But there&#039;s one guy dressed as a <em>king</em>, who seems to be arranging them all, i.e. he&#039;s <strong>set</strong>ting the boxes <strong>straight</strong>. &quot;Surely you&#039;re not a real <em>king</em>?&quot; I ask. He replies, &quot;Let me <strong>set</strong> you <strong>straight</strong>, I&#039;m <em>king</em> of the <em>boxes</em>&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 2-12-2008(4): A country needs to be<strong> set straight</strong> - if its <em>borders</em> are breached and its <em>jewels</em> missing.

Story: If you don&#039;t <strong>Set it Straight</strong>, it won&#039;t just be your dick in a box; it will be your <em>Balls in a Box</em>. Which is not nearly as much fun as the original.
