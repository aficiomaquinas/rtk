1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 15-8-2008(27): [+brose] The<strong> cormorant</strong> was historically used in Japan and China to catch fish. The fisher would use some rope or something to tie its throat so that it could only swallow small fish. If it caught something too big to swallow, it would take it back to the fisher&#039;s boat and the fisher would take it out. This particular<strong> cormorant</strong> is going after bigger and bigger prey - but one day it goes too far, and tries to swallow your <em>little brother</em>! Imagine trying to yank your brother out of its throat.

Story: U, I got an idea: instead of<strong> Cormorant</strong> Fishing ( 鵜飼い ), I&#039;ll use my <em>Disciples</em>弟子 to catch <em>&#039;Birds&quot;</em>. And by birds, I mean women.
