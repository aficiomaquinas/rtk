## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 29-7-2009(22): I <em>soil</em>ed my <em>ヌde crotch</em> when I got <em>head</em> and stuck it all the way down her<strong> neck and throat</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 10-2-2009(12): Women in certain African tribes put their <em>heads</em> through a <em>spool</em> into increase the length of their<strong> neck and throat</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 22-12-2009(9): Homeless in Shinjuku, February: I keep my <strong>neck &amp; throat</strong> warm by wrapping <em>toilet paper</em> around it, but my <em>head</em> is still cold.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 7-11-2010(4): 頚 <a href="../v4/2796">neck and throat</a> (#2796 頚)ケイ, くび ... Parts: 圣(巠), 頁 (cf 頸部 <a href="../v4/39868">Unicode-0x9bbc</a> (#39868 鮼)) ... Heisig got this wrong, it is not the simplified version Doctors use; it is the traditional version: 頸, with the old version of <em>Spool</em>: 巠. All of the 漢字 that use <em>Spool</em> can be written with either version : cf: 頚 -頸, 軽車 - 輕車 , etc. But just like the other non 常用漢字 this tends to stick with the old version.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 29-11-2008(4): Your<strong> neck and throat</strong> gag as the smell of <em>soiled crotch</em> hits your <em>head</em>.
