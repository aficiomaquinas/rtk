2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 31-10-2007(12): A special type of<strong> clay</strong>, this <em>soil</em> will cook into porcelain <em>straightaway</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 21-6-2008(7): Thanks to Aircawn:<strong> CLAY</strong> is pretty simple. It comes from the SOIL naturally. You&#039;ll make something pretty with it then STRAIGHTAWAY you must heat it to make it hold it&#039;s shape.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spleenlol">spleenlol</a>] 19-7-2010(6): Just as plants don&#039;t become trees straightaway (Ref: <a href="../v4/205">plant</a> (#205 植)), <em>soil</em> doesn&#039;t become<strong> clay</strong> <em>straightaway</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eckbw">eckbw</a>] 4-7-2011(1): <strong>Clay</strong> comes from the soil and you need to form it into something straightaway or it´ll dry up and become unusable. Onyomi ショク.
