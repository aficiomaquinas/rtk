## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 5-7-2007(25): Those gremlins! At <em>night break</em> they insist on coming out and <em>gluing</em> <em>stones</em> all over the place. These<strong> obstacle</strong>s make it nearly impossible for me to get to work!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 22-3-2010(6): You <a href="../v4/876.html">gain</a> (#876 得) 得 when you make forward progress. If you encounter a <em>rock</em>, you <em>cannot go</em> forward. Perhaps you can go round. This is an<strong> obstacle</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 12-1-2009(4): The column of soldiers who were gaining on the enemy at nightbreak ran into an<strong> obstacle</strong>: huge stone in their way.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 29-10-2009(3): The<strong> obstacle</strong> course in addition to the regular <em>stones</em> scattered about added a special<strong> obstacle</strong> at <em>nightbreak</em>: they poured <em>glue</em> all over the track.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 31-10-2010(2): 碍子 =がい子, 妨碍 =妨害, 障碍 =障害, <a href="../v4/2592.html">obstacle</a> (#2592 碍) ガイ (usu. 害 <a href="../v4/1551.html">harm</a> (#1551 害)) ... Parts: 石 , 旦 , 寸 (cf 得る <a href="../v4/876.html">gain</a> (#876 得)) ... Story: Main use of this kanji (not replaced by 害 ) is for electrical insulators 碍子 , so: In <em>Japan</em>, the preponderance of bare wiring in old homes, has made for a program of <em>Gluing Stones on the Floor</em> as an<strong> Obstacle</strong> to electrical flow.
