1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 2-12-2006(36): An<strong> armrest</strong> is something that lets you rest the <em>flesh</em> of your arm by keeping your <em>elbow by your side</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 3-2-2009(4): The primitive on the left I call the &quot;SUPERMAN POSE&quot; (he stand with his elbows to the side), well here you see he is actually using the part of his BODY, the hips, as an<strong> ARMREST</strong> when he does the SUPERMAN POSE.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 13-11-2010(2): 股肱 <a href="../v4/2469">armrest</a> (#2469 肱) コウ, ひじ (also 肘 ), 名乗り : ひろ ... Parts: 月 , 厷 (cf: 雌 , 八紘一宇 , 股肱 , 宏 , ... Story: 厷=<em>Elbow Pads</em>.<strong> Armrest</strong>s should not be made of <em>Steaks</em>, we should probably use <em>Elbow Pads</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 13-8-2008(2): You are sitting in a nice easy chair and all of a sudden there&#039;s a loud fart sound. Everyone looks at you, but you shrug your shoulders. They go back to what they&#039;re doing...&quot;<em>pyuuuun!</em>&quot; They look back at you. &quot;It&#039;s not me,&quot; you say, &quot;it&#039;s just this<strong> armrest</strong> rubbing against my <em>flesh</em>.&quot; They seem satisfied, and go back to their work. Little do they know that you&#039;re making <em>armpit farts</em> (my primitive for the right side) and really putting all of your <em>flesh</em> into it!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 14-11-2010(1): A twist on Nukemarine&#039;s story: Superman has realised that he&#039;s grown love handles. Now, when he does the <em>superman pose</em> (RHS), he has some extra <em>flesh</em> to use as an<strong> armrest</strong>.
