## Koohii stories: 

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 8-11-2008(37): <strong>Handmaiden</strong>&#039;s are usually quite <em>lowly women</em>, but this one is a special (just look at the way lowly is drawn).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(13): A<strong> handmaiden</strong> is a <em>woman</em> servant with the <em>lowly</em> job of burning <em>pirated Chinese DVDs</em> (rough copies of already <em>lowly</em> movies) <a href="http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article6730463.ece">http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article6730463.ece</a>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 22-12-2006(8): A<strong> handmaiden</strong> is a <em>woman</em> in a <em>lowly</em> regarded profession.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 5-10-2007(6): Tip: re lankydan&#039;s comment; there are two versions of &quot;lowly&quot;, with differing stroke count and stroke order. Version 1 is in nos. 1511, 1512, 2608, 2873. Version 2 is in 2196, 2579. Personally, to distinguish between them, I call them &quot;Wayne Slob&quot; and &quot;Waynetta Slob&quot; respectively (after the <em>lowly</em> couple in Harry Enfield&#039;s tv show).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 23-1-2011(1): Picture of a <em>lowly</em> <em>woman</em>, a <strong>handmaiden</strong>, walking on fours, cleaning the mess around.
