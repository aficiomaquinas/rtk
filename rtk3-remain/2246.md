1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 13-6-2009(31): &quot;How do you like my<strong> disguise</strong>?&quot; &quot;Umm... the <em>fingers</em> are only <em>part</em> of a<strong> disguise</strong>. You should really<strong> disguise</strong> the other parts of your body, too.. o.o&quot; (Imagine the guy is just wearing camouflage gloves or something along those lines.).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 24-7-2009(22): If I cover <em>part</em> of my face with my <em>fingers</em>, is that a good enough<strong> disguise</strong>?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 1-5-2007(8): &quot;Now <em>part</em> your <em>fingers</em>, and witness my latest<strong> disguise</strong>&quot; It might just work, your friend now appears completely invisible!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 3-11-2008(4): Picture the ending of every Scooby Doo cartoon. The villain is shown to be in<strong> DISGUISE</strong>. So you see FINGERS of the teen-agers grabbing to PART the mask from the bad guy. &quot;Old man Jenkins!!!&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 14-2-2011(2): Kanji that shows one weird <strong>disguise</strong> - you go to a party<strong> disguise</strong>d as a <em>finger</em> with 4 of your friends, each one as another finger. Each one of it is <em>part</em> of a bigger<strong> disguise</strong>.
