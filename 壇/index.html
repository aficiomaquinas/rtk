    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p><i>Soil/ground</i> . . . <i>top hat</i> . . . <i>-times</i> . . . <i>nightbreak</i>. With kanji as difficult as this one, it generally pays to toy with the various connotations of its primitives before settling on one image. Aim for as much simplicity as you can.</p>
