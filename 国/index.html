<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 12-1-2008(127): In my<strong> country</strong> (England) the crown <em>jewels</em> are kept <em>pent-in</em> in the Tower of London. Which happens to be where enemies of the state were once also <em>pent-in</em> (probably for trying to steal those <em>jewels</em>).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku">genbaku</a>] 11-1-2008(95): Just think of Japan, a<strong> country</strong> which is like a jewel but historically very enclosed.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 21-10-2005(30): Think of a<strong> country</strong> that has “<em>pent in</em>” all of its <em>jewels</em> so they wouldn't go away. Maybe it was China and its great wall.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ajikanji">ajikanji</a>] 17-4-2008(24): Japan was once a<strong> COUNTRY</strong> that went through a period of isolationism; it's JEWELS were PENT-IN and could not be traded.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skellyfish">skellyfish</a>] 13-2-2009(12): Picture a map of the world showing all the different <strong>countries</strong> PENT IN with thick borders, each one with an image of a pile of JEWELS proportional to its wealth (like those cute little geography maps from elementary school).</p>
