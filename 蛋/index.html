<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 29-6-2007(52): At the <em>zoo</em>, most animals think of <em>insects</em> as just good sources of<strong> protein</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 28-7-2009(9): <em>Insects</em> are fed to the <em>critters</em> at the <em>zoo</em> for<strong> protein</strong>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shidosuru">shidosuru</a>] 5-2-2012(3): The <em>zoo's</em> had this huge <em>bug</em> problem lately! Actually the problem wasn't the bugs exactly. All of the animals were eating the bugs, and got so much<strong> protein</strong> that they all became super strong! (imagine ripped penguins!) They started strong-arming all the visitors for their wallets and eventually ripped the iron bars of their cages open!</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Miyumera">Miyumera</a>] 30-8-2012(1): At the ZOO, most animals think of INSECTS as just good sources of<strong> protein</strong>. a ZOO was built on the back of a giant fly/INSECT and the zoo animals eat the flesh of this giant insect as source of<strong> protein</strong>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 11-3-2011(1): 蛋白質 , 皮蛋 , 蛋白石映光 (opalescence), <a href="../v4/2683.html">protein</a> (#2683 蛋)タン … Parts: 疋 <a href="../v4/2098.html">critters</a> (#2098 疋), 虫 … Story:Work with the idea that in Earlier times, the only<strong> protein</strong> available to Buddhist Japan were fish. SO people living in the mountains kept zoos, and got their only <strong>protein</strong> from the <em>insects</em> living off the animals in their <em>zoos</em>.<strong> Protein</strong> is written in kana on food packages: たん白質 . The actual meaning of the character is <strong>Egg Whites</strong>.</p>
