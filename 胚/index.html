<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 6-5-2007(42): When she took the pregnancy test because she thought she was carrying the <em>flesh</em> of an<strong> embryo</strong>, the test was <em>negative</em> and she dropped it on the <em>floor</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 19-1-2010(15): When a baby is born, he or she is considered "age zero". After a year of life, he or she is only then considered one year old. Since an<strong> embryo</strong> is found within a woman, it is effectively <em>part of the body</em> of that person. However, it is not yet zero years old - in fact, its age is <em>negative one</em> (i.e. -1 years old)! 胚性幹細胞 －　はいせいかんさいぼう　＝　embryonic stem cell.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 14-9-2010(2): Miscarriage: When the<strong> embryo</strong> didn't grow into <em>flesh</em>, its pulse was <em>negative</em> and it fell out onto the <em>floor</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 1-2-2009(2): An<strong> EMBRYO</strong> is considered part of the woman's BODY so is allowed to be abort. Pro life say "NEGATIVE", it is ONE human life.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 7-7-2008(2): An <strong>embryo</strong> is <em>flesh</em> transiting to a higher <em>plane</em> (that of a being). Note how the right side resembles an energy state transition diagram of an electron (<em>negative</em> particle) with two <em>planes</em> (energy levels) and an arrow pointing upwards.</p>
