<h2>Reading:</h2>

<h3>On-Yomi: <a>ジョウ</a> — Kun-Yomi: <a>たけ、だけ</a></h3>


	
    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>arm The picture of an arm dangling from the trunk of the body gives us the element for arm, or tucked under the arm (relative to the element below it). Examples of both usages follow. Unlike most primitives, the kanji that bears the same meaning (FRAME 1418 腕) has absolutely no connection with it. [2]</p>
	

  	
    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>The <b>length</b> whose measure this kanji depicts extends from the tip of one hand to the tip of the other with <i>arms</i> at full length. Notice the final stroke, which cuts across the vertical second stroke to distinguish it from <i>large</i> (Frame 112).</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 14-9-2007(197): Both a meter and a yard are about one arm-length.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samesong">samesong</a>] 29-8-2008(67): When girls ask about my<strong> length</strong>, I hold out my <em>one arm</em>, and tell them "you get the idea".</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 15-4-2008(57): This kanji reminds me of the kanji for big (I think it looks the same kinda of except for the last stroke). Maybe this works for guys, but when you were growing up you would compare "length" with your friends trying to show how BIG you were. You wouldn't show "it" but you would spread your arms out as wide as possible to exaggerate your<strong> length</strong>. Maybe even so wide that you trip (I the 3rd stroke getting pushed over)! I just find it easier to relate this to the previous kanji.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fragileshards">fragileshards</a>] 29-11-2007(37): This kanji demonstrates the proper technique for throwing a bowling ball the<strong> LENGTH</strong> of the alley. Stroke 1- lift the ball up horizontally to judge the throw Stroke 2 - gently swing the arm back Stroke 3 - whip your arm forward and roll the ball off the tips of your fingers Strike!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fruitangel">fruitangel</a>] 4-1-2009(23): ONE ARM<strong> LENGTH</strong>.</p>
