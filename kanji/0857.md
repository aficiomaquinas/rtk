1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samusam">samusam</a>] 27-9-2007(204): Picture the molten <em>lead</em> (the heavy <em>metal</em>) being discreetly drained out of the factory into a <em>gully</em> behind.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lizzie">Lizzie</a>] 4-10-2008(99): <strong>Lead</strong> is a very poisonous metal, and should not enter your mouth.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 28-7-2007(71): <strong>Lead</strong> -&gt; Dental fillings -&gt; Metal that enters the mouth to fill a hole in a tooth.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Austin">Austin</a>] 28-10-2005(49): One term in Chinese for a pussy is the &quot;golden gully&quot;. That is exactly the literal meaning of the two parts of this Kanji. To get the keyword out of this Kanji just think of all the GOLDEN GULLY&#039;s the boys in Led Zeppelin used to fill in thier hayday. Of all the rock bands in history, LE(A)D zeppelin is famous for how much sex they used to have - read &quot;Hammer of the God&#039;s&quot;, if you don&#039;t believe me.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Onikagii">Onikagii</a>] 13-7-2009(33): This is an odd story. IF you have ever broken a pencil right in two the long way you can see the pencil<strong> lead</strong> lying in the little gully formed by the wood. Helps me remember that<strong> lead</strong> is used in the word 鉛筆 えんぴつ for pencil.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 1-11-2007(9): <em>Metal gullies</em> for rainwater on roofs are traditionally made from<strong> lead</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 21-2-2007(7): A Muslim friend of a friend once said, &quot;If you don&#039;t convert, the angels will pour hot <strong>lead (metal)</strong> down your throat(<em>gully</em>/gullet)!&quot; This clearly reemphasizes the <em>into-mouth</em> of <em>gully</em> also. Bizarre image, but unforgettable.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod">PacifistGod</a>] 8-2-2007(5): When puting together circuit boards you connect the components by putting<strong> lead</strong> (solder) into the little gullys in the board.
