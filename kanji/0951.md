1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 9-1-2008(190): The <em>taskmistress</em> in a moment of weakness allowed the man&#039;s <em>column</em> to<strong> penetrate</strong> her. As punishment he was made to <em>bring up</em> their infant.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 7-11-2005(122): Ha! In this frame, a bunch of taskmasters are lined up to<strong> penetrate</strong> the kids they raise/bring up! I&#039;m thinking of some priests and choir boys.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 10-1-2008(65): Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to<strong> penetrate</strong> enemy <em>line</em>s (or the <em>columns</em> of soliders). It won&#039;t be easy: the soldiers have been <em>brought up</em> since birth, by the <em>taskmaster</em>, to be on guard. To remember <em>brought up</em>, imagine horrible Orcs being created and <em>brought up</em> through black magic and pledging their allegiance to the evil <em>taskmaster</em>. These aren&#039;t Orc recruits; these are Orcs that have been created through black magic and <em>brought up</em> to destroy the enemy.

After he is<strong> penetrate</strong>d, his angry parents tell him to <a href="../v4/760">remove</a> (#760 撤) his finger. (Don&#039;t know what a kancho is? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kancho">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kancho</a>).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gilch">gilch</a>] 11-6-2010(15): Note similarity to <a href="../v4/760">remove</a> (#760 撤). They seem kind of like opposites. <strong>Penetrate</strong> just <em>goes</em> all-in, but to <strong>remove</strong> something you need your <em>fingers</em>.
