heisig: "Grow up . . . breasts."
primit: "grow up As the plant grows up it sprouts leaves and a stalk, which are depicted here over a single horizontal stroke for the soil. Think of something (its relative primitive) growing up in a flash to many times its normal size, much like little Alice in Wonderland, who grew up so fast she was soon larger than the room in which she was sitting.

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erikkusan">erikkusan</a>] 14-3-2006(237): If you grow up with a mother that drinks and smokes, you can be sure it&#039;s<strong> poison</strong> in the stuff you get from her breasts.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 4-5-2007(82): Note that stroke order of <em>grow up</em> primitive isn&#039;t obvious from Heisig&#039;s diagram: single horizontal stroke is drawn first, then vertical and two horizontals.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ctraabe">ctraabe</a>] 5-11-2008(59): You can use silicone implants to to make your <em>breasts &quot;grow up&quot;</em> but if they leak, it&#039;s <strong>poison</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 26-3-2008(34): For <em>grow up</em> I will be using the idea of <em>Peter Pan</em> the boy who did anything but grow up. Have you ever wondered what happened to <em>Peter Pans</em> mother? My guess is he<strong> poison</strong>ed her.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 24-12-2007(23): To those who <em>grow up</em> lactose intolerant, <em>mother&#039;s</em> milk is a<strong> poison</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 8-4-2009(12): Peter Pan was the boy who never <em>grew up</em> [thx skinnyneo] However, he did try, he bought some growth hormones over the internet, but they turned out to just be<strong> poison</strong> and estrogen. He became sick, but he did grow a pair of <em>breasts</em> (<em>mameries</em> if you will). Made him very popular with the other lost boys.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dustin_Calgary">Dustin_Calgary</a>] 12-1-2009(10): Who would<strong> POISON</strong> me? My MOTHER of course, she didn&#039;t want me to GROW UP.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/faneca">faneca</a>] 16-3-2012(9): [Primitive: <em>Cyanide</em>. For me, having a meaning which is a <em>type of<strong> poison</strong></em> works way better for this group of kanji than <em>grow up</em>, <em>Peter Pan</em>, etc. I choose specifically <em>cyanide</em> because chemically is very <strong>elementary</strong> and is easy to associate with <strong>blue</strong> (cyan, cyanosis, methylene blue...)] <strong>Story</strong>: (thanks Saeko_chan) Snowhite&#039;s evil step <em>mother</em> tried to<strong> poison</strong> her... with <em>cyanide</em>, of course (that&#039;s why rescue breathing, er, I mean kissing, reanimated her -- won&#039;t work in real life, though).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meredithcat">meredithcat</a>] 12-8-2010(9): I&#039;m creating a new primitive meaning here: <em>Grow up</em> = <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> finds a bottle marked &quot;poison&quot;. She drinks it, and her breasts grow to an enormous size!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 31-12-2007(8): Alice in Wonderland has<strong> poison</strong>ous breasts. (If you don&#039;t believe me, she has a skull tatoo on her chest.).
