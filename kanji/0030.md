heisig: "While we normally refer to the start of the day as &quot;daybreak,&quot; Japanese commonly refers to it as the &quot;opening up of night&quot; into day. Hence the choice of this rather odd key word, <b>nightbreak</b>. The single stroke at the bottom represents the <i>floor</i> (have a peek again at frame 1) or the horizon over which the <i>sun</i> is poking its head"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 21-7-2007(191): A<strong> nightbreak</strong> happens when the sun rises over the horizon (floor).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomb771">tomb771</a>] 9-2-2007(65): It may be easier to think of the keyword &quot;DAYBREAK&quot; or &quot;MORNING&quot; for this kanji (other kanji dictionaries do). Then the mnemonic phrase &quot;SUN rising over the HORIZON&quot; works better. It is an infrequent kanji, but can be found in: 旦夕 （たんせき） morning and evening, or 元旦 （がんたん） New Year&#039;s Day.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cacawate">Cacawate</a>] 7-12-2006(43): The <em>sun</em> rising over the horizon is giving the <strong>night</strong> a <strong>break</strong>. -<strong>nightbreak</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epsilondelta">epsilondelta</a>] 15-12-2009(23): HINT: You can substitute <strong>sunrise</strong> in your stories if you don&#039;t like the rare (and ambiguous) &quot;nightbreak&quot;. Note that <a href="../v4/1201">daybreak</a> (#1201 暁) is already taken. Don&#039;t confuse with <a href="../v4/27">rising sun</a> (#27 旭), which is the sun itself, rather than the time of the day.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuki11">Tsuki11</a>] 29-10-2007(13): <strong>Nightbreak</strong>s when the <em>sun</em> peeks over the <em>horizon</em> at dawn.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/somukeru">somukeru</a>] 30-8-2009(8): Since<strong> nightbreak</strong> is a word I can never manage to use in a natural sounding sentence, and since this is clearly a picture of the sun coming up over the horizon, I call this one <strong>sunrise</strong>. It&#039;s no more confusing than<strong> nightbreak</strong> is with Daybreak 1201 and Dawn 2448, and it&#039;s a lot easier to make stories with.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chris.mariles">chris.mariles</a>] 26-11-2009(7): <strong>night break</strong>s as the <em>sun</em> rises over the horizon.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS">TerryS</a>] 21-11-2008(6): In Japan, when the <em>sun</em> comes up over the <em>horizon</em>, it&#039;s called<strong> NIGHTBREAK</strong> (not daybreak).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hoticehunter">Hoticehunter</a>] 27-4-2012(5): I change this kanji&#039;s keyword to daybreak so that it actually means in English what it means in Japanese. The reason Heisig didn&#039;t choose daybreak for this kanji is because he already has daybreak chosen for 暁 . I just change that one to dawn because they mean basically the same thing, and the image of a sun slowly coming up over the horizon is a clearer image of daybreak to me.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruschein">ruschein</a>] 4-1-2009(5): The<strong> nightbreak</strong> starts when the <em>sun</em> goes <em>down</em>.
