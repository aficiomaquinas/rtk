Here we see a<strong> PRAY</strong>ING man, kneeled before an ALTAR (think of any better place to<strong> PRAY</strong>?),<strong> PRAY</strong>ING to all the gods that that AXE wielding man behind him wot&#039;t cut him to pieces. Sadly, the<strong> PRAY</strong>ER goes unanswered, much to the delight of gore fans.
