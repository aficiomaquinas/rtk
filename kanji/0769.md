1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 29-7-2006(198): (Adapted from darg_sama&#039;s) Balancing a <em>branch</em> on your <em>finger</em> is the prototypical example of a<strong> skill</strong> that is nothing more than a<strong> skill</strong> (i.e., it is completely useless).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 24-10-2005(70): I think of a guy balancing a branch on his finger, which definitely takes some minimal amount of<strong> skill</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 10-5-2008(63): Better be <strong>skilled</strong> with your <em>finger</em> if all you&#039;ve got is a <em>needle</em> <em>crotch</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 5-4-2009(52): Forget balancing branches and stupid shit like that. It takes real<strong> skill</strong> to <em>finger</em> <em>ten</em> <em>crotches</em> at the same time. For real, nobody was ever a hero for balancing branches.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ceryn">Ceryn</a>] 6-6-2008(31): Grasping a BRANCH with their FINGERS was the first<strong> SKILL</strong> that premodern humans learned.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 6-6-2008(22): I would have to confirm the etymology of this kanji, but I will infer here that in the past, those who were said to have great<strong> SKILL</strong> (this kanji also means <em>arts</em> and <em>crafts</em>) were those who used their <em>fingers</em> and <em>branches</em> to make baskets, chairs, etc.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Captain+Kanjipants">Captain+Kanjipants</a>] 27-2-2010(20): A surgeon&#039;s<strong> skill</strong> with his <em>fingers</em> determines his <em>branch</em> of medicine.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 17-2-2009(17): A common ninja<strong> skill</strong> in Naruto is Kawarimi no jutsu -- use your fingers to do hand seals and replace your self with a branch / log. Reading: 技術 (technique) ギ, 技能 ぎのう (technical<strong> skill</strong>) 技術 ぎじゅつ(technique).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Melamelachan">Melamelachan</a>] 12-12-2009(10): Humans are more<strong> skill</strong>ed with their <em>fingers</em> than other animals, because we have opposable thumbs: one <em>finger</em> that <em>branches</em> off into a different direction.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j12358">j12358</a>] 8-8-2011(6): For gamers. Playing new rpg on touch screen computer (like ipad). Choosing<strong> skill</strong> by click of the finger on branch of<strong> skill</strong> tree.
