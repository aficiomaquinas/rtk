2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 28-9-2006(111): This <strong>mannerism</strong> is a <em>sickness</em> of the modern generation. It was only recently that we started putting <em>ketchup</em> on everything.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 12-12-2006(37): Building on inuki&#039;s idea: Monk, who suffers from OCD (a <em>sickness</em> involving <strong>mannerisms</strong>) sees a row of <em>ketchup</em> bottles at a restaurant crime scene and spends twenty minutes making the Heinz labels face exactly the same direction.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 4-2-2008(13): Sufferer from OCD (a <em>sickness</em> involving <strong>mannerisms</strong>) places thousands of drops of ketchup on his food in intricate patterns.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bizarrojosh">bizarrojosh</a>] 25-12-2009(8): A SICK<strong> MANNERISM</strong> is putting KETCHUP on everything.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 12-6-2008(5): Weirdest<strong> mannerism</strong> I could think of- a <strong>caveman</strong> having <strong>anal sex</strong> with a dinosaur.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 6-5-2008(5): He has the <strong>mannerism</strong> (vice, bad habit) of rubbing <em>ketchup</em> on and pretend he has a <em>disease</em> that&#039;s making him bleed from his nose and ears.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 5-7-2010(4): His<strong> mannerism</strong> of taking all the <em>ketchup</em> packets from McDonald&#039;s was like a <em>sickness</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 2-6-2009(4): The <em>caveman</em> is teleported to the present day - here we see him in McDonalds. He has a peculiar<strong> mannerism</strong> of insisting he put <em>ketchup</em> on everything he has ordered - I guess he misses the bloody adventures finding food usually entails, so this<strong> mannerism</strong> has developed to remind him of home.
