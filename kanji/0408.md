heisig: "<b>Determination</b>, in the sense of settling on a certain course of action, is likened here to <i>mending</i> one's <i>house</i>."
primit: "mending(szycie cerowanie) This primitive differs from the kanji for correct only by the movement added to the last two strokes, the &quot;-ing&quot; of mending if you will. But take a more concrete sense, like mending holes in socks. [5]"

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 4-7-2008(36): 定める 【さだめる】 (v1,vt) to decide; to establish; to<strong> determine</strong>; (P)The primitive &quot;mend&quot; is too arbitrary and I can never remember it. New primitive meaning: CORRECT PERSON: Do you see the 4th and 5th stroke? They look like the kanji for &quot;person.&quot; Therefore, CORRECT + PERSON = CORRECT PERSON. STORY: I DECIDED/DETERMINED I would fix my HOUSE this summer but am still looking for the CORRECT PERSON to do it (i.e. a contractor).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 4-10-2008(5): To me, the primitive in the house is a <em>perfectionist</em> (<a href="../v4/379">correct</a> (#379 正) + <a href="../v4/951">person</a> (#951 人)).
