1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jaresty">jaresty</a>] 8-10-2007(112): As the villain (pushed off by the anti-hero) is tumbling down the<strong> slope</strong>, he activates gadget skis to escape, spraying soil everywhere as he flies down the<strong> slope</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nakome">nakome</a>] 4-3-2008(100): This kanji depicts a classic enviornmental problem: erosion. Erosion occurs when all of the <em>soil</em> washes of the side of the <em>cliff</em>, eventually causing the <em>cliff</em> to disappear, leaving a<strong> slope</strong> (an <em>anti- cliff</em> if you will) in its place.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dakoina">Dakoina</a>] 2-3-2009(83): A<strong> slope</strong> is <em>anti</em>-flat <em>soil</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 7-1-2008(30): <strong>Slope</strong> = ski<strong> slope</strong>. You&#039;re speeding down the ski<strong> slope</strong> with your <em>anti-</em>gravity skis. These special skis work not only on snow, they even work on raw <em>soil</em>, allowing you to hover above the <em>ground</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 28-1-2008(20): Dirty Harry kicks the guy in the crotch. The poor guy rolling down the<strong> slope</strong> end up in a pile of earth.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku">genbaku</a>] 9-1-2008(20): Think of a<strong> slope</strong> as a piece of steep land that is anti everything, ie anything on the<strong> slope</strong> must roll off due to the steepness.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 9-10-2008(13): I&#039;ve been <em>anti-soil</em> ever since I fell down that<strong> slope</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shakkun">shakkun</a>] 17-2-2008(8): You would have to have anti-gravity boots to avoid sliding down that dirt<strong> slope</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mrgrimm">mrgrimm</a>] 3-2-2010(7): A <strong>slope</strong> is <em>earth</em> against (<em>anti-</em>) a cliff.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alatown">alatown</a>] 19-10-2009(6): Oops. Just when we though that Wile Cayote (our <strong>antihero</strong>) had fallen off the cliff, he tumbles over and over down a <strong>dirt</strong><strong> slope</strong>, triggering a mud slide.
