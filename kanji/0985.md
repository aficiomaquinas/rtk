1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 22-12-2009(189): Can also mean bacteria.....imagine the <em>wheat pent in your fridge</em> growing to the point where they resemble <em>flowers</em>.......I actually had something similar happen to onions...they grew footlong legs after about 2 or 3 years......OR just think of that Cowboy Bebop episode with the lobster in the fridge... :-).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 18-4-2007(91): Actually it means<strong> germ</strong>s as in microorganisms. So for example, you have to keep wheat enclosed so it isn&#039;t exposed to other plants. That way it can&#039;t catch any<strong> germ</strong>s (like fungi) from them.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 15-6-2007(47): If you <em>pent in</em> the <em>wheat</em>, it&#039;ll turn into wheat<strong> germ</strong> and sprout <em>flowers</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 30-6-2008(44): Keep your <em>wheat pent in</em> an airtight container or it may catch <strong>germs</strong> and sprout <em>flowers</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 29-6-2008(21): A very logical kanji. Wheat<strong> germ</strong> is the &quot;heart&quot; of the kernel; on a wheat stalk, there is a <em>flower</em>ing spike or <a href="../v4/909">ear (of a plant)</a> (#909 穂). The little <em>wheat</em><strong> germ</strong>s are <em>pent in</em>side of the seeds on the flowering ear.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 21-10-2005(14): <strong>Germ</strong>s of genetically modified <em>flowers</em> can not affect nearby <em>pent-in</em> crop of <em>wheat</em> (inspired from real-world regulations where genetically modified plants are <em>pent-in</em> to prevent their &quot;unnatural&quot; seeds from mixing with the local flora).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KeshaFran">KeshaFran</a>] 31-12-2010(9): <strong>Germ</strong>s will sprout like <em>flowers</em> if you leave the <em>wheat</em> <em>pent up</em> in a moist place.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 11-11-2008(8): I left my <em>Weet</em>abix all <em>pent up</em> inside the fridge. During the few weeks I forgot about it, <strong>germs</strong> started to breed and by the time I threw it out, there were even <em>flowers</em> growing in it!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 16-4-2010(7): NOTE: Also means &#039;mushroom&#039;. If you <em>pent up wheat</em> in a box, the<strong> germ</strong>s will soon mushroom and it will start to smell, so put a sweet smelling <em>flower</em> on top.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 18-7-2012(6): The [wheat]<strong> germ</strong> is the part under the <em>flower</em>, that <em>pent-in</em> kernel of <em>wheat</em>.
