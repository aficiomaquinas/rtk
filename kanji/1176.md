1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 11-9-2007(189): Of course it had to be the<strong> military officer</strong>&#039;s idea to <em>glue</em> a <em>national flag</em> to the <em>altar</em> he&#039;s stationed at.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 21-2-2006(81): Perhaps you have heard about Koizumis controversial visits at the Yasukuni war memorial shrine. It is the japanese flag waving above a small stone altar. A<strong> military officer</strong> keeps watch here night and day, to honor the dead war heroes, as if he is glued to the ground.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 7-10-2007(27): Only way I remember this is think of a<strong> MILITARY OFFICER</strong> standing next to a FLAG draped ALTAR (well, the coffin is by the altar) as if GLUED to it. Might hurt if you think that GLUED primitive looks like the<strong> MILITARY OFFICER</strong> is saluting the FLAG draped ALTAR, with a slight tear coming from the eye.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 6-3-2008(22): <strong>Military officer</strong>s glue their flags to the altars of the countries they&#039;ve conquered.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KristinHolly">KristinHolly</a>] 5-9-2008(17): The<strong> military officer</strong> is even patriotic when he watches tv. Whenever there&#039;s a <em>flag</em> on the <em>show</em>, he&#039;s just <em>glue</em>d to the set.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 15-5-2008(15): A<strong> military officer</strong> spying on an evil cult is captured and has his ass glued to their altar while they go out to do their mischief. The officer escapes by <em>peeing</em> on the <em>altar</em>, loosening the <em>glue</em>. (Note: I use &quot;pee&quot; for the &quot;flag&quot; primitive).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/slydog1">slydog1</a>] 19-3-2012(9): The<strong> MILITARY OFFICER</strong> is a servant to both country (FLAG) and church (ALTAR) which he believes are the GLUE that holds the country together.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/axelb">axelb</a>] 1-3-2009(6): Don&#039;t confuse with <a href="../v4/693">officer</a> (#693 吏), remember this is two words and therefore two &quot;blocks&quot; of primitives, <a href="../v4/693">officer</a> (#693 吏) is one word and has one &quot;block&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(5): The <strong>military officer</strong> wanted his national <em>flag</em> to be <em>shown</em> as often as possible, so he <em>glued</em> it to his uniform. [Thanks, einahpets].

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/trurlo">trurlo</a>] 29-1-2011(5): A <strong>military officer</strong> is quite different from the usual one (frame 693) because he has a war <em>flag</em>, just for <em>show</em>, <em>glued</em> to his helmet. Military types are vain...
