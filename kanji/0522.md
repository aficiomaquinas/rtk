1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 3-2-2008(270): <strong>Mirror</strong> should suggest vanity. Imagine a spoiled girl who gets her parents to buy her a <em>Golden</em><strong> mirror</strong> so she can <em>stand</em> in front of it all <em>day</em> vainly admiring her lovely <em>human legs</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/digicult">digicult</a>] 16-4-2009(23): The <em>metal</em><strong> mirror</strong> makes a <em>sound</em> - it&#039;s answering the question &quot;who has the fairest <em>human legs</em> of all?&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tritonxginnenglish">tritonxginnenglish</a>] 5-10-2006(23): <em>metal + stand up + sun + legs </em> remember the legend of <strong>Amaterasu</strong> who retired in a cave. the other Gods brought a <strong>MIRROR</strong> made of polished <strong> METAL</strong> at the entrance of the cave. Amaterasu who was <strong>STANDING UP</strong> saw her image of the <strong>SUN </strong> and began to dance with her <strong>LEGS</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 13-4-2008(12): Remember how Archimedes burnt an approaching fleet with<strong> mirror</strong>s?<strong> Mirror</strong>s then were <em>metal</em> and the sailors must have thought: &quot;What&#039;re those <em>metal </em> things up there, <em>standing</em> on the city walls? They look like <em>little suns</em> on <em>human legs</em>. Warm today isn&#039;t it?&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 9-12-2007(11): WARNING: Be extra careful not to confuse the <em>sun/tongue-wagging mouth</em> and <em>human legs</em> part of the<strong> mirror</strong> primitive with 見 <a href="../v4/57">see</a> (#57 見).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 19-7-2007(9): Snowwhite&#039;s evil step-mother <em>standing</em> in front of her <em>golden</em><strong> mirror</strong>, <em>wagging her evil tongue in her mouth</em> sends shivers down your <em>legs</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep">krungthep</a>] 19-5-2008(6): A marching brass band, with it&#039;s shinning <em>metal</em> instruments can be thought of as <em>sound</em> on <em>legs</em>. Its members don&#039;t need<strong> mirror</strong>s because they can see their reflection on their instruments.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meredithcat">meredithcat</a>] 4-4-2010(5): Picture a woman <em>stand</em>ing in front of a <em>metal</em><strong> mirror</strong> saying, &quot;My butt looks like it&#039;s the size of the <em>sun</em>!&quot; The right side of the kanji is a pictograph of the woman, with her butt and <em>human legs</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Axlen">Axlen</a>] 15-2-2010(5): (I totally disagree with the<strong> mirror</strong> designation of the primative on the right. I will call it <em>reflector</em>: imagine sound or light that gets reflected as running back to its source.) This<strong> Mirror</strong> made of <em>metal</em> is a good <em>reflector</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnyo">Johnyo</a>] 23-3-2009(5): If you look in the golden<strong> mirror</strong> you can <em>see</em> yourself <em>standing up</em>.
