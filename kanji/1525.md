heisig: "Tree . . . receipt . . . stamp."
primit: "receipt This primitive element is actually the mirror-image of that for stamp, but since Japanese does not permit a stroke to go to the left and bottom in one swoop, the visual similarity is not perfectly clear. If you play with the idea with pen and paper, its logic will become obvious. [3]"

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 5-1-2008(51): I ordered a<strong> willow</strong> <em>tree</em> off Amazon but when it arrived it was covered in postage <em>stamps</em>. I try to peel them off but it ends up leaving a papery mess and cheapifies the<strong> willow</strong>&#039;s appearance. Luckily I kept a <em>receipt</em>.

There are many <em>stamps</em> scattered around the base of the <em>tree</em>, which look like fallen leaves.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gaignun">Gaignun</a>] 17-10-2010(12): The weeping<strong> willow</strong> weeps because its <em>tree</em> friends are being converted into paper for <em>receipts</em> and <em>stamps</em>.

You could send in your receipt, along with the correct postage(stamp), to receive your very own copy of<strong> Willow</strong>, THE MOVIE!!! (A great movie I might add.).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 25-11-2007(4): <strong>Willow</strong>, the charming little man with the big heart from the 1988 Ron Howard movie of the same name, like many in showbiz has grown increasingly worried that there is no <a href="../v4/2041">sign of the hare</a> (#2041 卯). He is going around attaching to<strong> willow</strong> <em>trees</em> all around the area <em>receipts</em> and <em>stamps</em> bearing the hare&#039;s image. Help<strong> Willow</strong> find the hare! (see johnskb&#039;s story for <a href="../v4/2041">sign of the hare</a> (#2041 卯)).
