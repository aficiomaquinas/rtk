heisig: "With a <i>mouth</i> under a <i>cliff</i>, what else could we have here but the entrance to a secret cavern, before which a great <b>stone</b> has been rolled so that none may enter. Perhaps it is the hiding place where Ali Baba and his band of thieves have stored their treasures, in which case that magic word known to every school child who ever delighted over the tales of the <i>Arabian Nights</i> should be enough to push the <b>stone</b> aside. But take care - the <i>cliff</i> is steep, and one slip will send you tumbling down into the ravine below. This is the one and only time that the second stroke in <i>cliff</i> will reach over to the middle of the horizontal stroke. If you think of the edge jutting outwards (in keeping with the story above), the problem should be taken care of."

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nayelianne">Nayelianne</a>] 19-9-2008(37): There&#039;s a VERY simple way to remember this, in case the <em>cliff</em> thing isn&#039;t working for you... Just see it as a<strong> stone</strong> [いし] being <em>hammered</em> by a miner searching for jewel<strong> stone</strong>s [ほう<strong>せき</strong>] ;).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Uli_S">Uli_S</a>] 4-9-2009(33): If you pick the <em>right</em><strong> stone</strong>, and hit the kanji 右 <em>right</em> on its head really hard, you can chip off the upper stroke from it.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Murjab">Murjab</a>] 26-8-2007(5): To elaborate on Christine Tham&#039;s Indiana Jones reference, think of the opening scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark. It takes place in a cave... But here&#039;s a possible way to remember to put <em>cliff</em> before <em>cave</em>... Indy grabs the idol which starts setting off traps. He jumps over the <em>cliff</em>, but risks falling down and being swallowed in that <em>cave opening</em> forever. He escapes, but the final obstacle is the iconic scene in which he is chased by the large <strong>stone</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vanilla_l">vanilla_l</a>] 23-4-2010(4): The <em>mouth</em> of the cave under the <em>cliff</em> is a good place to get<strong> stone</strong>d. Also, there&#039;s a lot of <em>rocks</em> and stuff. <em>Stones, rocks</em>.
