2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tcjeff">tcjeff</a>] 17-8-2008(134): (rgravina) To ensure she remained<strong> undefiled</strong>, a young girl <em>growing up</em> in a rough area always kept a <em>dagger</em> concealed under her <em>Spiderman underwear</em> (to remember the position of <em>thread</em>), even when she went into the <em>water</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 6-2-2008(28): <em>Venom</em>&#039;s suit is self-cleaning and remains<strong> undefiled</strong>, despite its forming weapons, <em>growing up</em> into <em>daggers</em> and killing people, sending <em>drops of fluid</em> (blood) flying everywhere. No <em>water</em> necessary, and his conscience is clean too.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 26-12-2006(24): Oh no, comeback of the dirty imagery.. And I thought I got rid of that. Anyway, the &quot;grown-up dagger&quot; is a, um, phallus (are these characters like the Rorschach ink blots? Freud would be proud). Here someone ties a thread around it, so that dirty liquid won&#039;t come out of it and his surroundings remain<strong> undefiled</strong>.

They dip their daggers in sacred water to ensure they are<strong> undefiled</strong> for this ultimate battle for the fate of Never Never Land. [propz bihzad, just changed thread -&gt; venom because of placement).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 13-12-2006(10): During the time I was <em>growing up</em>, at the times I went swimming in the <em>water</em> of the big swimming pool of our town, I got very tired of boys pulling the <em>threads</em> of my bikini. I wish I could have carried a <em>dagger</em> to teach them a lesson (but of course that was not permitted). Oh well, despite their fumblings I remained<strong> undefiled</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 20-3-2011(7): To ensure she remained<strong> undefiled</strong> by <em>Venom</em>, his sister <em>grew up</em> carrying a <em>dagger</em>, even when she bathed in the <em>water</em>. 簡潔 (かんけつ) : brevity, conciseness, simplicity; 清潔 (せいけつ) : clean; 不潔 (ふけつ) : unclean, dirty, filthy, impure; 潔い いさぎよい manly, sportsmanlike, pure, upright.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 10-1-2008(7): [modified version of rgravina&#039;s] To ensure he remained<strong> undefiled</strong>, <em>Spiderman, growing up</em> in a rough area, always kept a <em>dagger</em> with him, and some holy <em>water</em> for luck.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 22-3-2008(6): <em>Water</em> is the most <strong>undefiled</strong> <em>element</em> and pure<strong> undefiled</strong> water must be used to make katanas.
