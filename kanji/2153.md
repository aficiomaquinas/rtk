1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyland1">Hyland1</a>] 30-4-2007(281): Here we see the evil tyrannizing tiger. What is on his chest? A giant E, for EVIL, of course.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 7-1-2007(69): The &quot;E&quot; shape actually means claws here, and the real etymology is a tiger tyrannizing other animals with its claws (the etymologies actually make sense once in a blue moon!). I think of the claws here as two hooks, representing the front paws. (stroke order of that part: <a href="http://google.com/#q=二＋">二＋</a> last of 直 ).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ezmoreldo">ezmoreldo</a>] 30-6-2008(19): The way to<strong> tyrannize</strong> a tiger is to stroke it&#039;s fur the wrong way with a broom (you don&#039;t want to use a comb because he&#039;ll eat you.).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 17-6-2007(6): The father<strong> tyrannize</strong>d the kids by keeping a hungry tiger in a box. In fact, one of the kids has already been fed...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 9-10-2007(5): In &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot;, an evil <em>tiger</em> with an <em>E</em> on it&#039;s chest<strong> tyrannize</strong>s the railroad builders. Thanks Hyland1!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Satchmobgw">Satchmobgw</a>] 24-11-2010(3): The best way to<strong> tyrannize</strong> your neighbors is to put a tiger in a box on their doorstep (just one though, you don&#039;t want to overdo it).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Daizumi">Daizumi</a>] 24-11-2010(3): The tiger<strong> tyrannize</strong>s the neighborhood. Every seven years, he forces the elders of the village to brand 7 young men with the letter E on the chest, for Eat me. He then comes to Eat them.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jotakami">jotakami</a>] 8-4-2010(3): Imagine the <em>tiger</em> Sher Khan, <strong>tyrannizing</strong> the jungle. raulir&#039;s suggestion of <em>two</em>+<em>hooks</em> for the bottom part is perfect. Just picture Sher Khan extending and retracting the claws (hooks) on his two front paws.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 23-5-2006(3): The friends of 100 Acre Wood decide that they need to have a leader. Because rabbit is a hard worker and seems semi-competent he wins. But as soon as he becomes the leader he begins<strong> TYRANNIZE</strong>S the others. After TIGGER bounces all around the vegetable patch, destroying ONE BOX filled with harvested vegetables after another, RABBIT prohibits what TIGGERS do best, bouncing.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/delenir">delenir</a>] 26-12-2009(2): The TIGER is TYRANNIZING everyone with his backwards ヨヨ (yo-yo).
