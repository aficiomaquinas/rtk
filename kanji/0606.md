7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 25-4-2006(12): This character is related to <a href="../v4/560">quasi-</a> (#560 准). The turkey has now started to thaw (see how the ice has turned into water) and there&#039;s a thermometer needle stuck into it to determine when it&#039;s ready. Thus, it&#039;s now the<strong> semi-</strong>meal stage, one step closer to completion than the quasi-meal.
