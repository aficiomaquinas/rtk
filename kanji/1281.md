1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stefanot">stefanot</a>] 6-5-2007(232): History of Pompei: An unexpect<strong> erupt</strong>ion and from the <em>mouths</em> of the volcano come lava that threatens the farmers collecting <em>haystacks</em> in the fields and the fisherman catching <em>shells</em> on the coast.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 20-12-2007(66): A bit nasty (but makes the whole thing much easier to remember) is to take the right side and call it a <em>bearded clam.</em> For<strong> erupt</strong>, you can make your own story about the <em>mouth/opening</em> on the left.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 17-6-2006(37): Well, the local farmers stuffed the <em>mouth</em> of the dangerous volcano with <em>haystacks</em>, thinking that would prevent<strong> erupt</strong>ions. Even more stupid was one tourist who threw some sea food (<em>shellfish</em>) into the <em>mouth</em> of the volcano. This caused an instant<strong> erupt</strong>ion of unprecedented magnitude!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 3-10-2007(24): After eating some particularly bad <em>clams</em> at a dodgy seafood restaurant, you<strong> erupt</strong> and release them back out through your <em>mouth</em>. You cover up the mess with a <em>haystack</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 1-2-2010(21): For <em>30 clams</em>, a prostitute will let you<strong> erupt</strong> in her <em>mouth</em>.....LOL...

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 22-1-2011(18): Hint: the &quot;haystack-shells&quot; combination is itself a rare kanji, <a href="../v4/36033">Unicode-0x8cc1</a> (#36033 賁). It means &quot;decorate&quot;, but since that keyword is taken (<a href="../v4/1477">decorate</a> (#1477 飾)) , I&#039;ll call it &quot;ornament&quot; (easy enough to get from <em>flower arrangement</em> + <em>shells</em>). Now, a volcano<strong> erupt</strong>s from its <em>mouth</em> to <em>ornament</em> itself with shiny lava (forget geological pressures, the thing&#039;s just vain).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ambassadog">ambassadog</a>] 14-12-2009(7): Rumpelstiltkin (he can spin <em>hay</em> into <em>money</em>) <strong>erupts</strong>, shouting obscentities from his <em>mouth</em> when his promise is unfullfilled.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop">richcoop</a>] 25-9-2008(7): <strong>Erupt</strong> - ing from the MOUTH of the volcano into the HAYSTACK was a sack of MONEY.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wally">Wally</a>] 26-5-2009(6): My MOUTH<strong> ERUPT</strong>S in joy when I win a HAYSTACK OF MONEY.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xingji">xingji</a>] 1-10-2009(5): Hint: clams+needles everywhere = SEA - URCHIN - if you put some SEA -URCHINS directly in your MOUTH your going to<strong> ERUPT</strong> in curseword and possibly a oozy allergic reaction.
