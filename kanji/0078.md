heisig: "Here is the full kanji on which the last frame is based. If you can think of a table full of carpenter's <b>tools</b> of all sorts, each equipped with its own <i>eye</i> so that it can keep a watch over what you are doing with it, you won't have trouble later keeping the primitive and the kanji apart."

It jerks around, monitoring all who come near, and if anyone so much as removes a stapler from the bench - ZAP.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dusmar84">dusmar84</a>] 17-12-2009(8): For me this is a pictograph. What are the two most basic<strong> tool</strong>s every craftsman needs? A level (eye) and a<strong> tool</strong> bench.
