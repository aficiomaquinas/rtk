8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gibler">gibler</a>] 23-4-2011(5): A more simple Primitive than bonsai: <strong>3 people 三 ＋ 人 </strong> As I was aged and dying, I could hear something from <strong>3 people</strong> (angels).. They said:<strong> play music</strong>, and the sounds begun for the first time... I think it was time for me to pass into <strong>heaven</strong>....but then BAM the <strong>3</strong> nurses next to my stretcher woke me up with the defribrillator RTK2:　ソウ 伴奏 ばんそう(musical accompaniment).
