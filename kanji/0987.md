heisig: "This kanji has a pictographic resemblance to a number of grains of <b>rice</b> lying on a plate in the shape of a star."
primit: "As a primitive, it keeps its meaning of rice, and is meant to connote a very ordinary, commonplace grain, in contrast to the primitive for wheat that we just learned. (This meaning accords well with Japan, where the output of rice far exceeds that of wheat.) It occasionally takes the shape j when it stands on its own, or is joined to a line above. In this case, we shall have it refer specifically to grains of rice. This primitive is not to be confused with the similar-looking primitive for water. While the stroke orders are nearly alike, grains of rice has 5 strokes, while water only has 4 because it joins the second and third strokes into one. Finally, we may note that by itself the kanji for rice is an abbreviation used for the United States, which can then also serve as an alternate reading for the main primitive form, if you so wish."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(154): Stroke order: I like to think of the first two strokes as “chop sticks” with which one eats the<strong> rice</strong>. The rest then is the “tree” meaning “plant” in this contexct. also: USA.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 19-12-2007(52): Two <em>drops</em> of<strong> rice</strong> in a <em>tree</em>, simple.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inaka_rob">inaka_rob</a>] 17-4-2012(23): 88! Japanese people think of this Kanji as 88. Each grain of<strong> rice</strong> holds 88 gods inside. Anyway, that is the origins of this kanji. It&#039;s easy to remember: Each grain of<strong> rice</strong> holds 88 gods. 八十八 written as one character. just remember one 八 is upside down.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 29-9-2006(10): Avoid <em>rice-grains</em> in stories that use the full 6-stroke 米 , use cups of<strong> rice</strong> instead. Reserve <em>rice-grains</em> for the abbreviated 5-stroke version as in <a href="../v4/932">lacquer</a> (#932 漆)漆 and <a href="../v4/933">Esq.</a> (#933 様)様.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rinkuhero">rinkuhero</a>] 20-9-2011(9): <strong>Rice</strong> grows on trees in America.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog">stupiddog</a>] 8-8-2009(6): Condoleezza <em>Rice</em> was a Secretary of State of the <em>USA</em> (the 2nd primitive meaning of this Kanji).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Okonomiyaki">Okonomiyaki</a>] 27-1-2008(5): Not too long ago, most people from the <strong>US</strong> were not able to use chopsticks properly. Thinking that the sticks were supposed to <em>cross</em>, they found themselves <em>dropping</em> <strong>rice</strong> all over the place.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 3-10-2006(4): I use Condi<strong> Rice</strong> as personification for the primitive.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 4-6-2010(3): Trivia: besides being shorthand for America/亜<strong>米</strong>利加/<strong>米</strong>国, 米 means &quot;lucky 88&quot;. Henshall says (in the entry for 寿 , ＃1351, p. 431): &quot;Note that eighty-eight is considered a particularly felicitous age, owing to the fact that the character for<strong> rice</strong> (a symbol of bounty and the life-force), 米 ..., can be graphically interpreted as ten 十 ..., times eight [upside-down] ハ..., with a further eight ハ...&quot; 米寿 【べいじゅ】88th birthday. (Cf. inaka_rob&#039;s story, and mine for 寿 <a href="../v4/1565">longevity</a> (#1565 寿)).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 31-12-2007(3): When trees get horny they reproduce and have a litter of<strong> rice</strong> (believe me, i&#039;m a treeologist).
