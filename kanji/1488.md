heisig: "<i>Fingers</i> . . . <i>mysterious</i> . . . <i>turkey</i>. Note that the <i>top hat</i> is extended across both elements, though it belongs only to the <i>cocoon</i>. This means that you may either use <i>mysterious</i>&nbsp;- as we did here - or take the three elements separately."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Proxx">Proxx</a>] 17-11-2007(252): A <em>mysterious</em> <em>turkey</em> with human <em>finger</em>s wants to<strong> hug</strong> me... I will never go to Tokyo Disneyland again!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pupul07">pupul07</a>] 14-12-2007(62): Imagine Gandalf<strong> hug</strong>ging a turkey....ouch! It bit off his finger!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ivantolearnkanji">ivantolearnkanji</a>] 25-3-2008(33): Ok sweetheart, I want you to point your finger at the mysterious turkey who<strong> hug</strong>ged you inappropriately.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/felicitygreen">felicitygreen</a>] 18-3-2006(20): As you peer even more closely at the <em>top-hat</em> clad <em>cocoon</em> from frame 1383 you realise that it&#039;s actually ET in disguise, back on earth for Christmas (carrying a <em>turkey</em> from his home planet), and holding out a luminescent brown <em>finger</em> towards you. You leap up and give him a<strong> hug</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 13-11-2006(17): You can also break this into primitives as conjecture with mysterious stuck in the middle (I have enough finger and turkey primitives going through my head that I don&#039;t need any more...). As you<strong> hug</strong> your loved one who&#039;s going off on a mysterious mission, your conjecture is that you won&#039;t see them again.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch">NeoGlitch</a>] 21-10-2010(9): With my <em>finger</em>s I lifted the <em>top hat</em> from the ground... and under it, I found the weirdest scene ever: A <em>cocoon with a long tail</em> and my <em>turkey</em> were<strong> hug</strong>ging and cuddling!!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 13-1-2010(9): You wonder who the <a href="../v4/1383">mysterious</a> (#1383 玄) man (thanks gothats) is when, IN THE MIDDLE of your <em>conjecture</em>, he suddenly<strong> hug</strong>s you and announces that he is a long lost friend. [Thanks ergerg for pointing out that this kanji is also <a href="../v4/663">conjecture</a> (#663 推) 推 with <a href="../v4/1383">mysterious</a> (#1383 玄) 玄 sandwiched in the middle]. HINT: Note that final stroke of &#039;cocoon&#039; is extended downwards here. To remember this point, imagine the mysterious man&#039;s cocoon-like wrapping falling away slightly. Also, the brim of his hat is very wide!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Deborah">Deborah</a>] 28-12-2008(7): The opposite of a bear<strong> hug</strong> is a turkey<strong> hug</strong>. You<strong> hug</strong> the <em>MYSTERIOUS TURKEY</em> with your <em>FINGERS</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 4-6-2011(4): I simply poked him with my <em>finger</em> and said, &quot;I want a<strong> hug</strong>.&quot; He could no longer put up the <em>mysterious</em> man front without coming off like a real <em>turkey</em>. Got my<strong> hug</strong>. 抱擁 =ほうよう = embrace in one&#039;s arms; 擁する =ようする = to have; to possess; 人権擁護 = じんけんようご = protection of human rights.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yuta73">Yuta73</a>] 10-4-2013(3): The <em>fakir</em> <strong>advocates</strong> for non-violent shop lifting and hides a <em>turkey</em> inside his <em>cocoon hat</em>, tucking the wings with his <em>fingers</em>. Then, someone accuses him of <strong>possessing</strong> an illegal hidden <em>turkey</em>.
