1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 19-12-2007(161): Think RPG. The wizard points his <em>finger</em> to the guard and the <em>ivy</em> he has just animated with his <em>magic wand</em> climbs down the wall to <strong>hang</strong> the poor guy, opening the way for the adventurers into the dungeon.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 10-10-2005(105): 3 ways you could<strong> hang</strong> something: 1) the normal way, with your finger putting something on a hook or whatever, 2)<strong> hang</strong>ing from a vine the natural way, or 3) by means of the magic of the wand.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 28-5-2008(82): This kanji depicts 3 different ways to<strong> hang</strong> something: using your <em>fingers</em>, using<strong> hang</strong>ing <em>ivy</em>/rope, or with the flick of a <em>magic wand</em>. (much thanks to Darg Sama!).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lozza">Lozza</a>] 28-9-2008(44): Naked Tarzan is swinging through the jungle, gripping the ivy with his fingers, his wand<strong> hang</strong>ing out.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 8-8-2009(21): (<strong>Warning</strong> - <em>really</em> grotesque image ahead - <strong>Warning</strong>) Use your <em>fingers</em> to wrap the <em>ivy</em> rope around the convict&#039;s neck, and then see if there is any truth to the story about a man&#039;s, ahem, <em>magic wand</em> becoming swollen when executed by<strong> hang</strong>ing.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-4-2007(21): At the end of book 7(?) Lord Voldemort is <strong>hung</strong> with a noose of magical <em>ivy</em>. He scratches desperately at it with the <em>fingers</em> of one hand while vainly grasping for his <em>wand</em> with the <em>fingers</em> of the other.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 12-5-2007(12): The best way to<strong> hang</strong> yourself is with some <em>ivy</em> (see <a href="../v4/198">Japanese Judas-tree</a> (#198 桂)). But I found that my fat <em>fingers</em> were unable to tie a tight enough knot: I kept on falling out of my noose. Finally, I gave in and used a <em>magic wand</em> to<strong> hang</strong> myself.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb">elmaestrokgb</a>] 18-6-2009(9): When Harry Potter fell down the trap door (in the Sorcerer&#039;s Stone), he first tried to<strong> hang</strong> from the wall with his <em>fingers</em>, then the <em>ivy</em> came up and tried to<strong> hang</strong> him, then Hermione took out her <em>wand</em> and zapped it, and said &quot;were you two just planning to<strong> hang</strong> around?&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63">ashman63</a>] 16-4-2008(9): <strong>Hang</strong> on a minute! Isn&#039;t that a person up there,<strong> hang</strong>ing precariously from the <em>ivy</em> with just his <em>fingers</em>? ..................................................................................................... &quot;<strong>Hang</strong> on sir!&quot; ................................................................................... Now where did I put my magic wand? I could use my wand to gently lower the <em>ivy</em> he&#039;s <strong>hanging</strong> off. I bet his <em>fingers</em> will be pleased to let go.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 28-2-2007(8): At Christmas we<strong> hang</strong> mistletoe, not an <em>ivy</em> but still an evergreen and woody plant like most <em>ivy</em>, over a doorway usually using our <em>fingers</em> to hold it and tack it up. We then wait for the <em>magic</em> of the season to work it&#039;s power on our unspecting sweetheart.
