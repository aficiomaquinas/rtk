2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mbagsh55">mbagsh55</a>] 18-9-2007(66): Two crazy brothers vying for the guiness records books of stupidity by trying to stand on their heads the longest.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tummai">tummai</a>] 23-6-2008(31): Roman times. Coliseum. Two <em>teenagers</em> with <em>vases</em> of acid strapped to their heads. They<strong> vie</strong> with one another, each trying to break the vase on their opponent&#039;s head. Imagine what happens to the loser when his vase breaks. To avoid confusion with &quot;contend&quot;, &quot;war&quot;, etc, remember that<strong> Vie</strong> and Vase both start with &quot;v&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rhclaghorn">rhclaghorn</a>] 26-12-2007(26): Twin <em>brothers</em> lined up side to side, each<strong> VIE</strong> to <em>stand</em> taller than the other.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog">stupiddog</a>] 31-5-2009(10): My two <em>elder brothers</em> <strong>vied</strong> to impress the same girl by singing under her window. Unimpressed by the performance, both of her neighbours dropped their <em>vases</em> on them.
