heisig: "The kanji carries the abstract sense of the <b>self</b>, the deep-down inner structure of the human person that mythology has often depicted as a <i>snake</i> - which is what the kanji shows pictographically. Be sure to keep it distinct from the similar keywords, <i>oneself</i> (frame 36) and <i>I</i> (frame 17)."
primit: "As a primitive element, this kanji can be used for the snake-- of which it is a pictograph--or any of the various concrete symbolic meanings the snake has in myth and fable. [3]"

What word starts with the letter &#039;s&#039; and ends up producing someone like your &#039;self&#039; later on? Sperm. Sperm are wiggly, like a snake, Contain 記 written dna records of yourself into them like words on a page, 起 rise up and run out of the penis once they ejaculate. require wrapping to prevent having babies, 包 .
