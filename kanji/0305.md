heisig: "What you are meant to <b>take along</b> in this kanji are not things but people. The image of the <i>car</i> on the <i>road</i> should ground your image for picking up your friends to <i>take</i> them <i>along</i> to wherever you are going."

And the CAR will help you to GO ALONG the ROAD. This Kanji is the &quot;Union&quot; in Soviet Union and the &quot;United&quot; of United Nations (the countries that &quot;go along with each other&quot; at least some of the time).
