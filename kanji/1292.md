1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 5-3-2007(165): At a mysterious bazaar, you happen to come across something interesting: a rolled-up<strong> scroll</strong> for only <em>25¢</em>. You buy it up impulsively until you realize that the powerful spell contained within is cursed by a poisonous <em>snake</em>. If you try to cast this spell, the snake will pop out of nowhere and bite you! Hrmph. No wonder it was so cheap...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 7-5-2007(110): How to make snake <strong>maki</strong>: Take a <em>snake</em>. Roll it up in rice and nori (seaweed paper) like a<strong> scroll</strong>. Cut into <em>quarters</em> and serve on a wooden geta with ginger and wasabi.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nadiatims">nadiatims</a>] 7-2-2008(48): This<strong> scroll</strong> isn&#039;t long enough to show more than a quarter of a snake.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 9-4-2007(31): The <em>quartered</em> <em>snake</em> was the illustration on the famous<strong> scroll</strong> by Ben Franklin that read, &quot;United we stand, divided we fall.&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 25-4-2008(22): Orichimaru (Naruto) uses a<strong> scroll</strong> to summon a SNAKE. To his surprise, the snake demands a QUARTER. Orichimaru forgot his quarters, so back into the<strong> scroll</strong> goes the snake...

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 3-3-2009(21): The world’s smallest snake can roll up (like a<strong> scroll</strong>) on top of a quarter. TRUE: (<a href="http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_Worlds_Smallest_Snake_Can_Curl_Up_on_a_Quarter_21434.html">http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_Worlds_Smallest_Snake_Can_Curl_Up_on_a_Quarter_21434.html</a>). NOT TRUE. The people of the Bahamas where the snake was found used the snake to protect secret information, they would put the snake inside a rolled up<strong> scroll</strong> and anyone who unrolled it would be bitten and dead in 3 seconds.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/axelb">axelb</a>] 29-7-2009(15): A<strong> scroll</strong> can be rolled together like <em>a snake</em> and thus takes only one <em>fourth/quarter</em> of it&#039;s original size.

It&#039;s divided into four <em>quarters</em>, each <em>quarter</em> containing a single incantation. I wouldn&#039;t try to figure out the correct order unless you meet the level requirement (or you have a enough points in &quot;Use Magic Device&quot;).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 25-4-2011(6): The <strong>scroll</strong> cost a <em>quarter</em> and was made out of <em>snake</em>skin.
