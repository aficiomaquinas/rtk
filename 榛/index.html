<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 13-1-2008(37): Tip: <em>bonsai</em> and <em>wheat</em> are later combined into <a href="../v4/2877.html">Manchu dynasty</a> (#2877 秦). Story: I come across lots of <em>trees</em> all planted in the <em>Manchu dynasty</em>. Then I notice every single one is a<strong> hazel</strong> tree. I wonder why? In the <em>Manchu dynasty</em> people must have been<strong> hazel</strong> nuts.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 20-6-2007(10): I love<strong> hazel</strong>nuts so much that I had a<strong> hazel</strong> <em>tree</em> installed in my backyard. Mostly it's just for decoration, like a <em>bonsai</em> plant, but I harvest it like <em>wheat</em> every so often: there's just nothing better than homemade Nutella.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 14-2-2010(5): During the <strong>Qin dynasty</strong>, the<strong> hazel</strong> <em>tree</em> was by far the most popular plant around. Everyone was a<strong> hazel</strong> nut - they planted the <em>trees</em> everywhere, and went as far as naming all their daughters<strong> Hazel</strong>, and wearing<strong> hazel</strong>-coloured contact lenses so they could tell people their eye colour was<strong> hazel</strong>, and not brown.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(3): In the <a href="../v4/2877.html">Manchu dynasty</a> (#2877 秦),<strong> hazel</strong> <em>trees</em> were common as people went<strong> hazel</strong> nuts planting <em>trees</em> the color of <em>Wheaties</em>! (thanks Katsuo).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 14-1-2009(1): Little known fact: The<strong> hazel</strong>nut spread Nutella, which tastes so good on <em>bread</em>, does not in fact come the<strong> hazel</strong> <em>tree</em>, but the <em>bonsai</em> plant.</p>
