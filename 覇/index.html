<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 14-3-2007(253): In the <em>Old West</em>, cowboys had <strong>hegemony</strong> OVER the Indians despite their <em>leather</em>craft and ability to navigate by the <em>moon</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 2-1-2007(51): In the old west, animal skins were made into leather and their flesh was eaten, thus using the whole animal, which viewed from the animal side could be taken as humans asserting complete<strong> hegemony</strong> over them. All your base are belong to us.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 27-2-2008(33): In the <em>Old West</em>,<strong> hegemony</strong> over Indians was ensured by binding and whipping the Indians' <em>flesh</em> with <em>leather</em> straps.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 23-11-2008(32): Leather + flesh = scalping. It's commonly believed that the Indians invented scalping but in fact it was the American colonists that created the practice of cutting off a dead Indian's hair + skin as proof of the kill. In response the Indians started doing the same to them, but history is written by the winners so most people blame the Indians for this barbaric practice. (true story) In the Old West, colonists exercised their<strong> hegemony</strong> by scalping the Indians.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 31-3-2010(13): In the <em>Old West</em>, the colonists asserted<strong> hegemony</strong> over the Indians by killing all the bison and depriving the Indians of their much needed <em>leather</em> and <em>meat</em>.</p>
