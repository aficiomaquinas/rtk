<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kusterdu">kusterdu</a>] 28-9-2008(19): The talking cricket says, "you've been spending a lot of time in the house lately," and you say, "What is that supposed to mean?", to which the cricket replies, "I'm<strong> imply</strong>ing you need to get a job!".</p>
