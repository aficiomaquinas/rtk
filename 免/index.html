<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 5-1-2007(203): Obviously this is the rabbit from Alice, excusing himself and rushing away on his legs, as he has a binding day schedule. This is at the same time an image, with bound=ears, day=head and legs are just legs. The image is used in <a href="../v4/2093.html">rabbit</a> (#2093 兎).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 7-1-2008(48): What is the rabbit's<strong> excuse</strong> for being such a jerk? Well he was b<em>ound up for a whole day</em> while being stepped on by peoples <em>human legs</em> in some make-up labratory. Yeah I think I can<strong> excuse</strong> him after knowing that.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 3-7-2009(43): ''<strong>Excuse</strong> me.'' Jessica <strong>Rabbit</strong> walks past you, <em>bound up</em> in a red sequinned dress in which her voluptuous <em>tatas</em> are sublimely complemented by her long <em>legs</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 7-12-2006(18): The <em>rabbit</em> always thinks that "Trix are for kids!" is a terrible<strong> excuse</strong> for stealing his breakfast.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tinonet">tinonet</a>] 30-1-2010(15): This is a <em>Bugs Bunny</em> with <em>bound</em> up ears and big <em>teeth in the mouth</em>. As you know, he has kinda <em>human legs</em> as well….So he says: Eeeeh, <strong>EXCUSE</strong> me, what's up Doc?</p>
