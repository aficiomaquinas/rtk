    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>This key word is yet another synonym for &quot;I,&quot; somewhat more familiar in tone. As a rule, it is a word that boys and men use to refer to themselves. Its elements: <i>person</i> . . . <i>husbands</i> . . . <i>in a row upside down</i>.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster">snallygaster</a>] 13-5-2008(145): Building on johnskb: Although it goes against the Heisig<strong> me</strong>thod, this story is a lot easier to remember when you know it's the kanji for "boku." Males usually use either "boku" or "ore" (instead of "watashi") to refer themselves. "Boku" is slightly boyish and soft; "ore" is rough &amp; tough. Mr. T would definitely use "ore" – but when he's one of the husbands hung upside down in a row about to be punished by his wife, he puts on a sweet act and switches to "boku" when he pleads "come on baby, it's<strong> ME</strong>!".</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 21-5-2006(112): Mr. T also finds himself as one of the HUSBANDs, whose wives have had them hung UPSIDE DOWN IN A ROW. But when his wife comes up to punish him, he pleads, “It’s<strong> ME</strong>, Baby. I wasn’t behaving badly like these other foo’s.”.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 28-5-2008(16): <strong>Me</strong> awaken to discover<strong> me</strong>self upside down over Mr. T's knee getting slapped. Does this make Mr. T<strong> me</strong> husband??</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 26-12-2006(11): <em>Row of upside down husbands</em> all begging <em>Mr T</em> to set them free…"<strong>ME</strong>!<strong> ME</strong><strong> ME</strong>!".</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 9-12-2006(5): <em>Mr T.</em> watches the <em>rowboat-overturning</em> <a href="../v4/1793.html">slap</a> (#1793 撲) from the shore and says, "I'm sure glad that ain't<strong> me</strong>".</p>
