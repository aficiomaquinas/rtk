<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 20-6-2007(23): There's a knock on my door, and it's the local dentist accompanied by an elephant. The latter is a patient, and the dentist explains that he wants to<strong> drill</strong> a hole in its tusk, but his normal dentist's<strong> drill</strong> is too small, so could he borrow my big DIY<strong> drill</strong>. Anyway, I<strong> drill</strong> the <em>hole</em> in the <em>tusk</em> for him.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 22-6-2007(17): No<strong> drill</strong>? Pfft, just use this here <em>tusk</em> as a<strong> drill</strong> and make all the <em>holes</em> you can!</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 26-3-2007(5): The smugglers used live elephants to smuggle their drugs: they<strong> drill</strong>ed <em>holes</em> into the <em>tusks</em> and hid the drugs there.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Haych">Haych</a>] 8-11-2012(2): Stone age<strong> drill</strong>s were just people on mammoths trying to get them to use their <em>tusk</em>s to bore a <em>hole</em> in something.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ShinseiJiyuu">ShinseiJiyuu</a>] 28-12-2012(1): In the ancient days, elephants once had<strong> drill</strong>s for<em> tusks</em> and made <em>holes</em> in everything as they pleased. When the original continent broke apart as a result, God though to himself, "Maybe that wasn't such a good idea…".</p>
