<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(13): To cut down on カロries, the <em>king</em> <em>adds</em> a<strong> jeweled hairpin</strong> to his coffee rather than sugar.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 1-8-2010(12): This and <a href="../v4/2963.html">beaded hairpin</a> (#2963 琲) only seem to occur in the word 珈琲 (コーヒー) where they are used phonetically. So, in practice, it might be easier to remember them as a pair and not worry about their literal meanings. STORY: For 珈 : An assassin <em>adds</em> poison to the <em>king</em>'s <strong>coffee</strong>. For 琲 : However, fearing a plot against him, the <em>king</em>, summons a hapless convict from a <em>jail cell</em> to sample the <strong>coffee</strong> first.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 11-3-2010(6): When the Jewish <em>king added</em> jewels to his<strong> jeweled hairpin</strong> he was lauded. When the Palestinian <em>king</em> put beads on his 琲 <a href="../v4/2963.html">beaded hairpin</a> (#2963 琲) he was jailed.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 23-3-2011(2): I'm changing this to <strong>coffee creamer</strong> and the next kanji to <strong>coffee</strong> for obvious reasons. STORIES: 珈 The servant <em>added</em> <strong>coffee creamer</strong> to the <em>King</em>'s coffee. 琲 The <em>King</em> likes his <strong>coffee</strong> black, so the servant went to <em>jail</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Regular">Regular</a>] 17-11-2010(2): If my aunt adds a pe*is, she'll be my uncle. If the King adds a<strong> jeweled hairpin</strong>,… she's a queen.</p>
