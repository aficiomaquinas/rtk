    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>The cold air from the <b>north</b> is so strong that we see <i>two people sitting on the ground</i> back to back, their arms interlocked so they don't blow away. (Pay special attention to the drawing of the first 3 strokes.)</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 17-12-2007(148): <strong>Warning:</strong> The left part is NOT the primitive <em>turtle</em>! The stroke order is different. Sometimes it will look exactly the same but not always depending on the font / style used to draw this character. Be sure to study the difference!</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shadolite">shadolite</a>] 20-3-2008(122): In the<strong> north</strong>, the weather is so cold that people are often seen sitting back to back to preserve warmth.</p>

The stroke order is different. Sometimes it will look exactly the same but not always depending on the font / style used to draw this character. Be sure to study the difference! My 'story': There are NO <em>turtles</em> at the <strong>North</strong> Pole. What looks like turtle-backs are actually Igloos, so small you can barely <em>sit</em> inside them.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alatown">alatown</a>] 5-8-2009(17): The<strong> north</strong> is cold, so why doesn't this couple spoon to keep warm?</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63">ashman63</a>] 9-4-2008(11): People! this has nothing to do with turtles. The strokes are different. Don't use turtle in this story. Just stick to the people sitting back to back in the cold<strong> north</strong>.</p>
