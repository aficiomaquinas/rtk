<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 24-7-2009(23): The<strong> indecent</strong> man made even the <em>pack of wild dogs</em> <a href="../v4/2569.html">apprehensive</a> (#2569 畏).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 21-5-2007(17): An<strong> indecent</strong> video featuring a helpless victim taking hairpins in his brain while a pack of wild dogs tears him from limb to limb, has generated calls for compulsory censorship of the internet.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 13-6-2009(10): The<strong> indecent</strong> streaker started to feel a little <em>apprehensive</em> after security set a <em>pack of wild dogs</em> on him. Time to cover the family jewels!</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 28-3-2010(6): I was out in the woods wearing only a skirt made out of sausage links held together by a <em>hairpin</em> (don't ask why) when I came across a pack of <em>wild dogs</em>. I ran for my life, but the dogs kept chasing. I ran out of the woods and into a <em>rice field</em>. The dogs were getting too close. I undid the <em>hairpin</em> and let the sausages fall to the ground. The dogs took the bait! Seconds latter I was arrested for<strong> indecent</strong> exposure. Please post bail!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thairob">thairob</a>] 29-7-2008(4): Robert Redford's new<strong> INDECENT</strong> proposal is a little over the top. He will pay 1 million dollars if Demi Moore will eat a WILD DOG BRAIN with a HAIRPIN.</p>
