<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 15-4-2008(199): This famous ninja (I always use ninjas with <em>sabres</em>, distinct from samurai) used to<strong> engrave</strong> the kanji for his name onto <em>acorns</em>, and throw the <em>acorns</em> to distract his enemies. The legend goes that by the time his victims would pick up the <em>acorn</em> and read the<strong> engrave</strong>d kanji, they were already dead.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 3-8-2006(76): While it's traditional for lovers to<strong> engrave</strong> their names on a tree in many countries, in Japan, however, it was traditional for a samurai to signify his undying love for a woman by engraving the kanji of her name on an <em>acorn</em> with his <em>sabre</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 17-10-2009(20): TIP: This also means "time"… STORY: The Swiss watchmaker is a master<strong> engrave</strong>r. He<strong> engrave</strong>s the minutes and seconds on an <em>acorn</em> using a tiny <em>saber</em> to make a miniature cuckoo clock… 遅刻 [ちこく].</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet">sweetneet</a>] 14-8-2006(19): Whenever i think of "engraving" i think of wedding invitations. :) well there's this one bride who wanted to be unique, so rather than on paper, she decided to<strong> engrave</strong> their wedding invitations on an <em>acorn</em> with a <em>sabre</em>, and give that out to their guests. (Not true story, but with brides' crazy ideas these days, I wouldn't be surprised…) :-).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 9-1-2008(17): Just picture Zorro using his <em>saber</em> to<strong> engrave</strong> his name out on a giant <em>acorn</em>.</p>
