    <p>A tree . . . cliff . . . ten thousand.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey">onsen_monkey</a>] 6-9-2006(276): There are a bunch of<strong> HORSE CHESTNUT</strong> TREES on top of this CLIFF above the beach. Chestnuts keep rolling off the cliff and falling on people's heads. So far TEN THOUSAND people have been killed by falling chestnuts, and the Japanese government still ain't did shit about it.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 26-1-2008(72): There is a<strong> horse chestnut</strong> <em>tree</em> that has grown by a <em>cliff</em> for so long, it has deposited <em>10,000</em> <strong>horse chesnut</strong>s that lie at the bottom. Don't worry over this one too much, you'll spend so much time trying to figure out the right story for it, you probably won't forget it.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lizzie">Lizzie</a>] 9-7-2008(38): <strong>Horse chestnut</strong> trees grows in tens of thousands under the cliff.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog">stupiddog</a>] 29-3-2010(28): Strokes 5 and 6 are in reverse order, so it's not an ordinary cliff, but a <em>drag</em> (primitive at the beginning of lesson 50!) Story: When we were kids, we loved collecting the fruits of the <strong>horse chestnut</strong> <em>tree</em>. But because there were so many to collect, we sometimes <em>dragged</em> more than <em>ten thousand</em> of them behind us!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 7-12-2008(28): This is NOT a cliff. the first stroke is right to left and slanted a bit. in fact, it's more like the axe blade of the axe character. story: you didn't want to try to chop down the<strong> horse chestnut</strong> tree with an axe because the chestnut kept falling on you. so instead you just stacked up <em>10,000</em> <em>axe-blades</em> next to the tree, and eventually they the stack fell on the tree and sliced it to pieces.</p>
