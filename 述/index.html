    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>resin This tree has become a pole (that is, a tree with its branches not touching) because most of its branches have been pruned off by a naive but greedy gardener anxious to siphon off its resin (the drop at the top, written as the final stroke) as quickly as possible. [5]</p>

<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 16-5-2007(172): Why are the roads leading through the woods so sticky and dirty? Hmm… I think the forest ranger<strong> mention</strong>ed something about excess <em>resin on the roads</em>…</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tristanthorn">tristanthorn</a>] 18-3-2009(112): No-body <strong>mention</strong>ed that there was <em>resin</em> on the <em>road</em>. Now I'm stuck!</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 23-1-2008(52): The resin factory worker sees the boiler about to explode and hesitantly says to his boss, "um, there's something I should<strong> mention</strong> to you…" At that moment the factory explodes and sends an overflowing batch of resin is cascading down the road bringing fiery death. (Semi-true story, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Molasses_Disaster">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Molasses_Disaster</a>).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 24-1-2010(30): Resin <strong>Primitive</strong>: Cell Phone tower. They make <em>cell phone towers</em> look like <em>trees</em> by putting <em>fake branches</em> on them, but you know it's just a metal pole. The <em>antenna</em> at the top is a dead giveaway. <strong>Story</strong>: On the top 10 list of dumbest ideas, placing a <em>cell phone tower</em> in the middle of the road earned an honorable<strong> mention</strong>. I nearly hit it everyday when I drive to work.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kyle_N">Kyle_N</a>] 2-4-2008(21): Did I<strong> mention</strong> this road was freshly resined and you shouldn't walk on it? Sorry too late, sucker!</p>
