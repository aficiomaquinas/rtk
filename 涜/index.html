<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 26-4-2007(73): The church is <em>selling</em> holy <em>water</em> for the faithful, but if you dare to say its tap water, they'd tell you you were <strong>blaspheming</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 12-11-2009(4): During the Wedding at Cana, the Son of God had some people come up to complain after he performed his miracle. "This wine is terrible! Are you trying to <em>sell</em> me <em>watered</em>-down wine?" He replied, "It's a wedding, for God's sake, the wine is free, so stop complaining." The dissatisfied guest retorted, "Hey, don't<strong> blaspheme</strong>!" Jesus Christ just rolled his eyes and, under his breath, uttered his own name in vain.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harpagornes">Harpagornes</a>] 14-10-2011(2): "Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and <em>selling</em> there…" Mathew 21:12. In the Japanese version of this event, Jesus drives out the <strong>blasphemers</strong> by throwing <em>water</em> at them. Cf. 売 <a href="../v4/323.html">sell</a> (#323 売).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 7-4-2008(1): Crooks<strong> blaspheme</strong> the free-market system by trying to <em>sell</em> something as readily availabile (in Westernized countries, at least) as <em>water</em>. Don't spend $4 bucks for a plastic bottle of what you can get from your tap!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(1): Long ago people would<strong> blaspheme</strong> you for trying to <em>sell water</em>.</p>
