<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 7-10-2007(21): Tip: "snack" or "appetizer" would be better keywords for this kanji.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(10): <em>Wolverine</em> <em>possess</em>es his own <strong>snacks</strong> when he goes out drinking.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 3-12-2008(5): <em>Wolverine</em> <em>posess</em>es the most <strong>treats</strong> at the party because he's <strong>entreat</strong>ed for being famous.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 27-5-2009(2): The <em>Possess</em>or of the <strong>Snacks</strong> (i.e. Mom) thinks you've had too many, so she hands you a <em>sheaf of grain</em> and says to chow down on something healthy.

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 15-8-2008(2): You're out at a restaurant with your family when all of a sudden the <em>Grim Reaper</em> shows up to take your life. He's about to drag you away, when you say, annoyed: "Look, buddy. We just ordered the <strong>appetizer</strong>. Can you at least let us finish that part of our meal?" "That depends," says the <em>Grim Reaper</em>. "What did you order?" "A big <em>Fred-Flintstone-size side of ribs</em>," you say. "In that case," the <em>Grim Reaper</em> says, "it's a deal. And I'll join you, I'm hungry for <em>flesh</em> anyway.".</p>
