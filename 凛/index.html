<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 24-4-2007(45): Much more <strong>stately</strong> than that soil podium, this is made of <em>ice</em>. You can still see the dude standing behind it in his <em>top hat</em>, and he still spouts pretty much nonsense as many <em>times</em> as he can, but you have to admit his <em>showy altar</em> is quite <strong>stately</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 3-1-2007(13): This<strong> stately</strong> home in Brittain has been used for winter weddings <em>many times</em>. A reverend in a <em>top hat</em> stands behind the <em>altar</em> in the home's chapel, which is adorned with <em>ice</em> sculptures. Very romantic.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 11-10-2009(6): One can have a<strong> STATELY</strong> wedding in Hell, Norway. Stunning ICE sculptures all around, a TOP HAT clad wedding chapel reverend performing weddings many TIMES a day behind a frozen ALTAR. (Thanks astridtops) See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell</a>,_Norway for more info.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kioku3">kioku3</a>] 19-7-2009(3): Abe Lincoln visited the state of Minnesota in January 1863, and decided to give his speech from an <em>ice altar</em> at an unheated but<strong> stately</strong> church instead of a soil <em>podium</em>. It was a<strong> stately</strong> speech in the coldest state of the Union.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/faneca">faneca</a>] 14-7-2012(1): [See 禀<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/31104">Unicode-0x7980</a> (#31104 禀), 稟<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/31263">Unicode-0x7a1f</a> (#31263 稟): Chosen keywords: <strong>Salary in rice</strong>, <strong>disposition</strong>. Willy Wonka holds a <strong>meeting consultation</strong> with the oompa loompas to inspect their <strong>disposition</strong> to earn their <strong>salary in wheat</strong>. But they don't seem very eager: they drop the wheat and put Willy Wonka over the <em>evil altar</em>…]. Wonka then uses his baton to press a button and lower the temperature: the oompa loompas stay <em>iced</em> while he gets himself up on the altar and pretends to look <em>stately</em>.</p>
