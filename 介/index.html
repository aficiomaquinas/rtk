<h2>Reading:</h2>

<h3>On-Yomi: <a>カイ</a> </h3>


	
    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>umbrella The actual character on which this primitive meaning umbrella is based we shall not meet until FRAME 1026 傘. We may think of it as a large and brightly-colored beach umbrella. If you compare this with FRAME 8 八, you will notice how the two strokes touch here, while the kanji for eight would leave a gaping leak in the top. [2]</p>
	

  	
    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>The idea of something getting <b>jammed into</b> something else is depicted here by having a <i>walking stick</i> get <b>jammed into</b> an <i>umbrella</i> frame by someone shoving it into an already occupied slot in the <i>umbrella</i> stand at the door. First notice the vertical strokes: on the left is the curved umbrella handle, and on the right the straight <i>walking stick</i>. Now try to imagine the two parties tugging at their respective properties like two kids on a wishbone, creating a scene at the entrance of an elegant restaurant.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LucidFaia">LucidFaia</a>] 9-4-2008(194): The two strokes at the bottom look like a J and I, which stands for "jammed in.".</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alkulp">alkulp</a>] 29-10-2007(63): Two people<strong> jammed in</strong> under an <strong>umbrella</strong>. A woman with a dress and a man (straight). It's always me that ends up getting wet…. but the tail of the skirt is this time!</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yozora">Yozora</a>] 19-5-2009(55): J and I are "Jammed Into" an UMBRELLA.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne">sethimayne</a>] 18-10-2007(13): The <em>beach umbrella</em> is<strong> jammed in</strong>to the sand using <em>two poles</em> instead of one, so it's extra steady. I was a little rough though so I accidentally bent one of them.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 9-6-2008(12): 介する 【かいする】 (vs-s,vt) (1) (See を介して ) to use as an intermediary; to mediate; to assist; (2) to worry; to mind; to care. STORY: It's raining out and you are arguing with your bf/gf about why they didn't bring their own UMBRELLA. Now the two of you are<strong> JAMMED IN</strong> under one (J and I just how lucidfaia said). Then imagine another person who forgot their UMBRELLA JAMMES IN with you and offers to MEDIATE your argument in exchange for protection from the rain.</p>
