    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>locket The vertical stroke added here (the third stroke) turns the primitive element for a key into a locket. Below that, we find a square container (the mouth) and sunglasses with one of the lenses popped out. Note that in the primitive element for locket the final vertical stroke of sunglasses reaches all the way through to touch the mouth. [10]</p>

<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 1-5-2006(168): Mr. T is certainly an<strong> ADMIRABLE</strong> PERSON, so much so that parents are buying lockets with his picture in it and having their children wear them like amulets.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 21-2-2008(79): For <em>locket</em>: The <em>locket</em> (<em>key</em> dangling from something, the vertical stroke) opens like a <em>mouth</em>, but you need a jeweler's <em>monocle</em> to make out the pictures within. —– <em>Dracula</em> survives a staking attempt when the <em>locket</em> with Mina's<strong> admirable</strong> picture deflects the blow. "It was an<strong> admirable</strong> attempt," he admits as he sucks his attacker's blood.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 21-1-2008(52): <strong>Stroke order:</strong> Heisig says that the added vertical stroke is the third stroke, but it's the first of primitive (so it's the third of <em>this</em> kanji, but in the book he's talking about the primitive).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 23-5-2007(39): She thought that <em>Mr. T</em> was a tough, heartless guy, but then she found out that he carries around a <em>locket</em> with a picture of his daughter. Suddenly, she found it<strong> admirable</strong> that he had such a soft side.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brose">brose</a>] 17-2-2007(14): Hint: <em>locket</em> = <a href="../v4/17.html">I</a> (#17 吾) + <em>sunglasses with one of the lenses popped out</em> with the top line of 五 left off. <strong>えらい</strong>。.</p>
