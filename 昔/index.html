    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>salad The element for flowers joins with the long horizontal stroke beneath it to create the picture of a bowl of salad. [4]</p>
	

  	
    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p><i>Salad</i> . . . <i>days</i>. This is the character with which Japanese fairytales commonly begin.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the_marshal">the_marshal</a>] 30-4-2006(209): <strong>Once upon a time</strong>, the children were forced to eat their salad every day.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andye">andye</a>] 11-1-2007(147): For those who don't know the expression, "salad days" means the time of one's youth. (originally from Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_days">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_days</a>). I suspect Heisig chose "salad" as the name for the radical just for this phrase…</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 20-10-2007(107): <strong>Once upon a time</strong> there was a McDonald's <em>salad</em> and it was left out in the sun for a whole <em>day</em>. But … nothing happened because it was a McDonald's salad, chock full of preservatives and other garbage. The salad lived happily ever after (and so did the person who didn't eat it). The end. [I didn't write this… the original author deleted it… but it's my favourite story on the whole site.].</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 31-1-2010(19): This is the kanji for "mukashi". Often used for "once upon a time" or "long time ago". I will take this kanji to mean "really fucking long time ago"……A really fucking long time ago, I use to eat <em>salad</em> every <em>day</em> and was very slim…..those days are long gone and I'm now fat as a pig…</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 2-3-2009(8): <strong>Once upon a time</strong> there was a ruler called <em>ceaser</em> (shiza sarada). He ruled everything under the <em>sun</em>, even the <em>sun</em> worshiping egyptians, until one <em>day</em> he was killed and then his <em>sun</em> Augustous took over. I think Ceaser will be an easier primitive than<strong> once upon a time</strong>. N.B. It's worked really well for me over the next couple of kanji.</p>
