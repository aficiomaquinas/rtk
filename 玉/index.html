    <p>Note the drop here in the king’s scepter, which is exactly what you would expect it to be: a precious jewel handed down from of old as a symbol of his wealth and power. [5]</p>
	

  	
    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>Note the <i>drop</i> here in the king's <i>scepter</i>, which is exactly what you would expect it to be: a precious <b>jewel</b> handed down from of old as a symbol of his wealth and power.</p>
  
  
  	
    <h2>Heisig comment:</h2>
    <p>* As a primitive, we can use this to mean either <i>jewel</i> or <i>ball</i>. When it appears anywhere other than on the left side of a kanji, it takes the same shape as here. On the left, it will be lacking the final stroke, making it the same as the character in the previous frame.</p>
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip">Ramchip</a>] 24-4-2007(200): The king is said to have only one family<strong> jewel</strong> below the belt…</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 20-1-2008(36): The king is said to have only one family<strong> jewel</strong> below the belt…and he hangs left! (I always screw up the direction of the "drop").</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indiana23">indiana23</a>] 28-12-2009(35): I can tell you that there is only one thing that Japanese people think when they see this Kanji, and that's BALLS(no joke). Kintama, or gold balls, means testicles. Funny story, we met a European girl not to long ago who had this as a tattoo, and she thought it actually meant<strong> JEWEL</strong>. But as I said, the Japanese guys wanted to know why she liked BALLS so much. lol (True Story).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 7-12-2007(15): Only Kings can poop<strong> jewel</strong>s.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RobMow">RobMow</a>] 30-6-2009(13): King dropped his pants to reveal his<strong> jewel</strong>.</p>
