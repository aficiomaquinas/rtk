<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 13-4-2007(362): Can simplify this using <a href="../v4/1243.html">decay</a> (#1243 朽). Then: The expedition to the<strong> poles</strong> is bad for your health, and the <em>decay</em> that started in your <em>mouth</em> spreads to your <em>crotch</em> – at which point you fall to the <em>floor</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 17-3-2008(101): (modified Katsuo) Can simplify this using <a href="../v4/1243.html">decay</a> (#1243 朽). You travel to the <em>poles</em>, a frozen wasteland. In desperate need of food you try to set up a snare but the tree is <em>decayed</em> (see story for <a href="../v4/1243.html">decay</a> (#1243 朽)) so you catch no prey. The brutal cold first attacks your <em>mouth</em> as your lips turn blue, then your <em>crotch</em> also gets cold as your body fails; finally you fall to the <em>floor</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 24-12-2006(20): Santa Claus (from the North <strong>Pole</strong>, of course), has a <em>wooden</em> sled led by reindeer <em>snared</em> at the <em>mouth</em>. One unfortunate night, he jumps down a chimney and burns his <em>crotch</em> on a piece of coal as he hits the <em>floor</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 12-6-2007(7): The diverging magnetic fields at the<strong> poles</strong> actually attract cosmic radioactive <em>decay</em>, particularly the kind that causes cancer in the lips or the testicles. But don't worry, you can protect either your <em>mouth</em> or your <em>crotch</em> by digging a hole in the <em>ground</em> and covering it up. Which part do you protect? Imagine coming back home with cancer in the other, unprotected part.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aeryon">Aeryon</a>] 16-1-2012(4): I remember sharing this joke on the playground back in 1986. "Did you ear about the dumb polak who climbed a tall tree to see both<strong> poles</strong>? On the way up, stepped in his own snare, fell to the floor and ended up with his crotch in his own mouth. Then he said seeing his own crotch in his mouth… that's not the pole I wanted to see!".</p>
