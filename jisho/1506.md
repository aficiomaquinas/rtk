Sisyphe is the epitome of the<strong> tenacious</strong> men :for all eternity, he would have to push a rock up a mountain; on the top, the rock rolls down again and Sisyphus has to start over. This ROUND rock which makes him runs in circles doesn&#039;t prevent Sysiphe being HAPPY : he&#039;s too<strong> tenacious</strong> to relinquish. N.B: round as a primitive for Sysiphe (avoid confusion with plump).
