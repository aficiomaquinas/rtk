## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-9-2007(133): The <strong>hinge</strong> on <em>Wolverine&#039;s</em> <em>cardboard box</em> is made of wood because he doesn&#039;t have enough budget to buy metal <strong>hinge</strong>s.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 2-9-2008(101): You notice a<strong> hinge</strong> on a <em>tree</em> and realize there&#039;s a secret door. You open it up to find an <em>Xbox</em>!!!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 25-6-2006(47): The<strong> hinge</strong> in this hospital <em>ward</em> was made of <em>wood</em> because they didn&#039;t have enough budget to buy metal<strong> hinge</strong>s.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 5-4-2009(32): I like using &quot;X Box&quot; as the primitive instead of ward. The first <em>X Box</em> had a lot of problems. I guess Microsoft was in a hurry to get it out. I even noticed that the<strong> hinge</strong>s were made of <em>wood</em>... what the hell?

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 22-4-2007(17): Make sure you install the<strong> hinge</strong> the right way. If it opens <em>treeward</em> (= <em>tree</em> <em>ward</em>), you won&#039;t be able to get the fence open, make sure it opens houseward.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 5-12-2007(10): Only a goofy visual works here: Imagine a TREE, now you see a door on the TREE open up with a <em>squeek</em>, so that you&#039;re forced to notice the squeeking<strong> HINGE</strong>. Well, this noise wakes up WOLVERINE that was hiding in the BOX inside the TREE, that he comes out for a quick attack.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 29-6-2009(9): All the<strong> hinge</strong>s in the ward were made out of wood.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 24-12-2008(9): The metal<strong> hinge</strong> in the hospital <em>ward</em> kept squeaking and waking up the patients, so they replaced it with a <em>wooden</em> one.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/delbertmon">delbertmon</a>] 18-1-2010(6): In Japan, different areas are famous for different things. In the ward famous for trees everything is made of wood, even the<strong> hinge</strong>s.
