## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 6-3-2007(167): Re CharleyGarrett: This liquid looks like ordinary <em>water</em>, but it will instantly<strong> seethe</strong> when it comes in contact with counterfeit <em>dollar bills</em>. The inventor must be rich (and probably has dollar signs in his eyes).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 12-3-2007(115): When his daughter used a lot of <em>water</em> for her shower, the father could practically see the <em>dollar signs</em>, so he was <strong>seething</strong> with anger.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 3-3-2009(52): This kanji is more closely related to water and emotions boiling. Story: When his daughter used a lot of WATER for her shower, the unemployed father could practically see the DOLLAR SIGNS going down the drain. He began SEETHing with anger... (Thanks smithsonian).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 11-5-2008(29): Hint: This <em>dollar sign</em> is clearly one of those iced out dollar pendants. <a href="http://newworldtreasures.100megs2.com/Test/HHCP221.jpg">http://newworldtreasures.100megs2.com/Test/HHCP221.jpg</a> And just imagine <strong>seething</strong> after someone gets water all over your brand new <em>dollar bling pendant</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ivoSF">ivoSF</a>] 21-1-2008(24): I<strong> seethe</strong> (and not only from the heat)when i found out how many dollars one water bottle costs in this desert!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nac_est">nac_est</a>] 13-2-2008(16): <em>Water+dollars</em> = Jacuzzi. Think of all that <strong>seething</strong> and warm water!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 16-9-2009(10): Picture yourself at an amusement park. You&#039;re so thirsty, but you don&#039;t have much money, so you just decide to buy a bottle of <em>water</em>, thinking it won&#039;t be that expensive. However, you go to the kiosk and see the price: <em>$</em>5!!. Seeing that price makes you<strong> seethe</strong>. This also refers to boiling, so imagine that you buy the bottle of water, but you&#039;re so angry that when you take the bottle, your anger heats it up (like it would in a cartoon) and the water boils and spills out of the bottle!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 3-1-2008(9): When the US forcibly opened Japan to world trade the Japanese<strong> seethe</strong>d. <em>Water</em> represents the Pacific Ocean from whence the gaijin came and the <em>dollar</em> their economic power.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 29-3-2009(6): The ridiculous cost $$$ of hot water makes me<strong> seethe</strong>. My emotions boil over, just like the water. RTK2:　フツ 沸騰 ふっとう (boiling).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Artur83">Artur83</a>] 17-4-2009(4): Im Mittelalter war Salz sehr wertvoll. Man kann sich comic-artig vorstellen, wie Salz<strong>sieder</strong> beim <strong>sieden</strong> salzhaltigen <em>Wassers</em> <em>Dollar</em>zeichen in den Augen haben.
