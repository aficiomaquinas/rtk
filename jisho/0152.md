heisig: One of the things that causes the erosion of <i>soil</i> is the excessive <b>pressure</b> of the top<i>soil</i> on the lower <i>soil</i>. This can be caused by any number of things from heavy rainfall to heavy buildings to the absence of sufficient deep-rooted vegetation to hold the layers together. Here we see a steep <i>cliff</i> without a tree in sight. The <b>slightest</b> pressure on it will cause a landslide, which, with a little help from your imagination, you will be able to see happening in this character.
