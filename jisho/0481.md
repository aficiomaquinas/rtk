## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 6-8-2007(106): What is a<strong> RHYME</strong> but some SOUND that EMPLOYEES say to get them through work.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alunalun">Alunalun</a>] 4-7-2009(56): A<strong> rhyme</strong> is the <em>sound</em> of an <em>employee</em> going off to work. Everyone knows that ever since &#039;Snow White&#039; in 1937 all employees sing &#039;hi ho, hi ho, it&#039;s off to work I go&#039; (because it&#039;s so catchy!
