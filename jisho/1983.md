9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dat5h">dat5h</a>] 11-7-2009(7): Interestingly, there is a ward in Tokyo called   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/練馬区">練馬区</a>   (ねりまく). One of the prevailing theories of the origin of it&#039;s name is that it was a place for keeping and training horses during the   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/江戸時代">江戸時代</a>  . It has lot of farmland smack dab in the middle (north west, really) of Tokyo (trust me, I live there).
