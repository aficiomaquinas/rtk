## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 5-2-2007(205): <em>All</em> buildings of <em>The Pinnacle</em> are multi-<strong>storey</strong>. They don&#039;t have much room, so they have to build up. It sucks when someone presses <em>all</em> the buttons on the elevator! You have to stop at each <strong>storey</strong>! 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 25-2-2008(81): Some stupid kid has pushed <em>all</em> the buttons in the elevator. As it stops at <em>all</em><strong> storey</strong>s you reach a <em>pinnacle</em> of impatience. Finally you reach your<strong> storey</strong>, the last one, at the <em>pinnacle</em> of the building. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/b0ng0">b0ng0</a>] 4-2-2009(42): The <em>pinnacle</em> of a building is the sum of <em>all</em> the<strong> storey</strong>s. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 14-12-2006(11): The second<strong> storey</strong> of the acropolis is the Laundrymopolis, where the elite Greeks meet to compare the whiteness of their sheets. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jaunty">Jaunty</a>] 7-8-2009(9): You&#039;re taking the elevator up to the <em>pinnacle</em>, and someone presses <em>all</em> the buttons, making <em>everyone</em> wait while it stops at every<strong> storey</strong> (thanks dingomick). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 6-12-2007(7): In <em>osaka pinnacle</em> towers, <em>everyone</em> takes the elevator instead of the stairs.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/何階ですか？">何階ですか？</a>  . 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blubko">blubko</a>] 15-6-2012(4): To reach the pinnacle you have to get up ALL<strong> storey</strong>s. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/frychiko">frychiko</a>] 2-3-2009(4): ALL stories/floors of a hotel are usually the same, but the PINNACLE or penthouse is usually special. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/WithLoveFromExIA">WithLoveFromExIA</a>] 10-1-2009(3): Fancy walking up <em>all</em> the<strong> storey</strong>s of that skyscraper to reach the <em>pinnacle</em>? I&#039;d rather take the lift. Really stress the all in your image. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zodiac">zodiac</a>] 4-12-2008(3): You&#039;re trying to get to <em>The Pinnacle</em> (which is at the top of a building) but some stupid kid has pushed <em>all</em> the buttons... now you&#039;ll have to stop on <em>all</em> the<strong> storey</strong>s... (thanks Spidercat).
