## Heisig V6:

This kanji and primitive refers to the <i>part of the body</i> composed of the bones and their joints. The top part of the kanji, terminating in the element for <i>crown</i>, is a pictograph of a bone joint. I leave it to you to put the pieces together, so to speak.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 1-6-2006(145): Your body <em>meat</em> is attached to the <em>bone joints</em> of your<strong> skeleton</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 27-11-2009(105): The top box 口 is the skull and the brain 田 has shriveled to the size of marble (but following kanji convention it is depicted as a square) and rolled into the bottom right hand corner. With all the hair and flesh gone the crown has slipped down to the shoulders like a necklace. 月 represents the rest of the body of the<strong> skeleton</strong>. [Idea for position of crown thanks to n1williams].

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Medialis">Medialis</a>] 23-3-2010(44): The most awesome pictograph ever: It&#039;s a guy going through an x-ray examination. The crown primitive depicts a glowing power field that goes from the top of this head down to the floor, progressively revealing his <em>skeleton</em>. Now, it&#039;s at the position of his shoulders, so everything below it is still <em>flesh</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 5-3-2009(25): Imagine a king who died on his throne and was never removed. Since his<strong> SKELETON</strong> has no hair, ears, etc, the CROWN has slipped down past several bone JOINTS and rests amid other PARTS OF his BODY.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 26-6-2007(22): Imagine a<strong> skeleton</strong> wearing a <em>crown</em> and with <em>flesh</em> on just its <em>bone joints</em>. What a strange<strong> skeleton</strong>...

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 12-1-2008(10): Distinguish from bone. Since I used<strong> skeleton</strong> imagery in my previous primitives for bone, I picture this &quot;skeleton&quot; as the metal frame of the Terminator. His metal <em>bone joints</em> are visible, the <em>flesh</em> having been torn partially off of his metal exo<strong>skeleton</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 29-9-2007(9): Who has a <em>jaw-bone crown</em> over his <em>flesh</em>? Why it could only be Skeletor, He-Man&#039;s nemesis!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 17-4-2007(9): With <em>joints</em> <em>crowning</em> the <em>parts of the body</em>, this is the<strong> skeleton</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Revenant">Revenant</a>] 26-6-2011(6): Rote memorization...

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wynterp">wynterp</a>] 17-3-2008(5): <strong>Skeleton</strong> made me think of Jack Skellington from The Nightmare Before Christmas. His really skinny <em>body</em> is <em>crowned</em> with a bunch of <em>bone joints</em> for a head.
