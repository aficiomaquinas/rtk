5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 23-1-2009(3): At the risk of confusing with &quot;captured&quot; (frame 1018) I&#039;m going to use &quot;to capture&quot; as the keyword since this kanji often shows up in kidnapping related compounds and<strong> flexed</strong> is hard for me to work with. Here, you bind up the kidnapping victim&#039;s arms together at the elbows behind his back when you capture him.

Notes: Odd Keyword. Replaced by 拘 <a href="../v4/654">arrest</a> (#654 拘) in most compounds. ... Note2: Magatama ( 勾玉 ) a bit of historically important Japanese art (<a href="http://bit.ly/cTgQi8">http://bit.ly/cTgQi8</a>). ...
