heisig: What we have to do here is turn a <i>shellfish</i> into a <b>page</b> of a book. The <i>one</i> at the top tells us that we only get a rather short book, in fact only <i>one</i> <b>page</b>. Imagine a title printed on the shell of an <i>oyster</i>, let us say "Pearl of Wisdom," and then open the quaint book to its <i>one</i> and only <b>page</b>, on which you find a single, radiant <i>drop of</i> wisdom, one of the masterpiece poems of nature.
