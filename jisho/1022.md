heisig: "Let this doubling of one of the elements for &quot;<i>inside</i>&quot; yield the sense of &quot;<i>insides</i>&quot; to approach the key word, <b>meat</b>. The abbreviated form of this character gave us the primitive meaning of <i>flesh</i> or <i>part of the body</i> for the kanji 月."

## Heisig V6:

Let this doubling of one of the elements for &quot;<i>inside</i>&quot; yield the sense of &quot;<i>insides</i>&quot; to approach the key word, <b>meat</b>. The abbreviated form of this character gave us the primitive meaning of <i>flesh</i> or <i>part of the body</i> for the kanji 月.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 13-1-2008(176): Here we are looking at an x-ray of a cannibal whose insides are full on people-meat.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narafan">narafan</a>] 19-9-2007(61): A <em>person&#039;s</em> <em>inside</em> - fleshy, raw, pink,<strong> meat</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 24-12-2007(24): To avoid confusion with the <em>flesh</em> primitive from <a href="../13">month</a> (#13 月), I&#039;m nicknaming this one: <em>soylent green</em>. It&#039;s easy to remember since &quot;Soylent green is people!&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dontpokebadgers">dontpokebadgers</a>] 21-7-2010(14): Inside a person is<strong> meat</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 28-11-2007(10): I like narafan&#039;s story that captures the primitives nicely, but I&#039;m with Rakushun and fuaburisu - this is just a pictograph of a slab of<strong> meat</strong> (I picture a t-bone steak), and it gets reinforced since you constantly see it on menus.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RandomQuotes">RandomQuotes</a>] 6-12-2012(9): Honestly, I know Heisig cautions against pictographs, however, when I took Japanese in high school, the only thing i could think of when I saw this was two gay men in a bed giving each other their<strong> meat</strong>. Thing is it&#039;s 12 years later, and that image is stuck in my mind.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 1-6-2013(5): &quot;I want some<strong> meat</strong> <em>inside</em> me right now!&quot; she demanded on our first date. &quot;What kind of a <em>person</em> talks like that on a first date?&quot; I asked, a little shocked. &quot;A hungry<strong> meat</strong> eating <em>person</em>?&quot; she answered. The abbreviated form of this is the same as <a href="../13">month</a> (#13 月), which explains the hitherto seemingly unconnected primitive meaning of <em>part of the body</em>, or <em>flesh</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 7-8-2011(5): 肉食 , 皮肉 , 肉離れ , 筋肉 , 弱肉強食 , <a href="../1022">meat</a> (#1022 肉)ニク, ... Parts: 内 , 人 (cf: 腐さる <a href="../1023">rot</a> (#1023 腐), 宍 <a href="../2216">venison</a> (#2216 宍)) ... &#039;Meat primitive&#039; is 月 used many, many times, this Kanji should be brute forced memorized. Any story you come up with will end up getting confused with the 月 from hundreds of other stories. Luckily, the only time 肉 is used to make another kanji is the very next one: 腐る <a href="../1023">rot</a> (#1023 腐) ... Note:only 肉 and 宍 <a href="../2216">venison</a> (#2216 宍) have the reading of ニク.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kyoti">kyoti</a>] 27-12-2009(4): Inside a person is all<strong> meat</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/busaiku">busaiku</a>] 1-10-2009(4): Looks like the pictogram of an open pig. Can&#039;t you see the ribs in there?
