## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 14-1-2006(250): The top 16 strokes are the chinese radical for &quot;dragon&quot;. Joining up both meanings of the radical we can name the top part of this kanji &quot;imperial dragon&quot;. Two-headed snakes do exist as biological curiosities, and they look a bit like a <em>slingshot</em> (with the heads splitting at a junction). Our <em>imperial dragon</em> here, the pet of a Chinese emperor, is a rare &quot;three-headed slingshot-snake&quot; kept in a <em>vase</em> and fed with <em>meat</em>. When the emperor<strong> attack</strong>ed neighbours, his army wore the <em>imperial dragon garment</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jackswitch">jackswitch</a>] 31-3-2009(99): Fuaburisu&#039;s story is incredibly good, but I made it a bit simpler: The <em>imperial dragon</em> is a rare &quot;<em>three-headed slingshot-snake</em>&quot;, kept in a <em>vase</em> and fed with <em>meat</em>. It&#039;s very aggressive, so at feeding time you need to wear the special <em>garment</em> or it will<strong> attack</strong> you.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 20-2-2008(65): You<strong> attack</strong> an <em>old dragon</em> 龍 and take his <em>clothes</em>. REF: <a href="../v4/2981">dragon [old]</a> (#2981 龍).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 27-11-2009(21): You<strong> attack</strong> the <em>Ancient Chinese dragon</em> 龍 with the help of your fire-proof <em>garment</em>. Ref: <a href="../v4/2981">dragon [old]</a> (#2981 龍).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/plumage">plumage</a>] 23-5-2009(15): Legend of Zelda: Link<strong> ATTACK</strong>S by throwing a VASE at the FLESH of the boss, fires his SLINGSHOT, uses his HOOKshot 3 TIMES, and wears a magic GARMENT, all to try to find its weakness.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 9-1-2007(10): You go to the <em>garment</em> district and you see a <em>vase</em> full of <em>meat</em> ...something looks fishy so you pull out your <em>slingshot</em> ...<em>three snakes</em> come out and you<strong> attack</strong> them.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 27-5-2011(6): After the<strong> attack</strong>, all that was left <em>standing</em> was some <em>meat</em>, <em>three slingshots mangled into a snake</em> over strewn <em>garments</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jajaaan">jajaaan</a>] 5-1-2010(3): I used the meaning of <strong>air raid</strong> for this kanji, since it&#039;s used in that compound, is easier to get from the primitives, and is a kind of<strong> attack</strong>. STORY: to survive an air raid by dragons, especially <em>old dragons</em> who can&#039;t be arsed to do anything more than breathe fire on the village as they fly <em>overhead</em>, all you need is a fireproof <em>garment</em> to wear.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hknamida">hknamida</a>] 10-11-2007(3): Someone <strong>attacks</strong> you by launching a <em>vase</em> of rotten <em>meat</em> using a <em>slingshot made from a three-headed snake</em> (yes, that&#039;s what I call that compound). The force of the impact is not enough to injure you, but the rotten meat completely drenches your <em>garments</em>, ruining them.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jessem">jessem</a>] 7-2-2013(2): Legend of Zelda. Link fights a dragon boss; you have to throw a vase at its flesh to stun it and then fire your slingshot at it to<strong> attack</strong>. Do this three times and it&#039;ll die, rewarding you with magical garments impervious to<strong> attack</strong>s at the end!
