## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 12-7-2006(208): The secrets of<strong> fermentation</strong> are passed to the son who displays the most filial piety.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 14-6-2006(131): Since <em>filial piety</em> is all about respecting ones elders, and the older a <em>whiskey bottle</em> is (i.e. the time it have spent undergoing<strong> fermentation</strong>) the more respect you should give it, the meaning of this kanji becomes clear. If it doesn&#039;t, sink back some whiskey and it will.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-7-2008(104): Add a phrase to Raichu&#039;s story: The secrets of<strong> fermentation</strong> are written on a <em>whiskey bottle</em> and passed to the child who displays the most <em>filial piety</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonny_wonny">jonny_wonny</a>] 23-3-2009(29): In a family of alcoholics, <em>filial piety</em> is saving the more <strong>fermented</strong> <em>whiskey</em> for the elders.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 21-2-2008(15): The boy throws the body of the old man in the whiskey barrel. There he lets<strong> fermentation</strong> do his work. The best whiskey ever.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vengeorgeb">vengeorgeb</a>] 23-4-2009(8): The secrets of whiskey<strong> fermentation</strong> are passed to the son who displays the most filial piety.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 6-1-2008(6): &quot;Much like a fine <em>whiskey</em> <strong>ferments</strong> over time, a child too must ferment into adulthood.&quot; This is the <em>filial piety</em> motto.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SuzuBell">SuzuBell</a>] 19-2-2011(3): Proper<strong> fermentation</strong> requires years of patience: When an old man drinks his <em>whiskey</em> he knows its process began back when he was but a child. In a sense, a properly <strong>fermented</strong> bottle of <em>whiskey</em> is much like <a href="../v4/1253">filial piety</a> (#1253 孝) in that it is respected for its age and wisdom!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/myglagata">myglagata</a>] 22-4-2009(3): For a birthday treat, an <em>old man</em> wants to see the alcohol<strong> fermentation</strong> process, so his <em>child</em> carries him to the <em>whisky</em> distillery.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kosutakuru">kosutakuru</a>] 14-3-2009(3): Proper <em>fermentation</em> takes years and years and years of patience. If you put the <strong>whiskey</strong> in the bottle when you&#039;re still a <strong>child</strong>, you have to let it ferment and mature a very long time, and only pop it open when you&#039;ve become an <strong>old man</strong>.
