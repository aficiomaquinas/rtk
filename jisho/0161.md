heisig: "Just as sitting before a <b>fire</b> enlivens the imagination and lets you see almost anything you want to in the flames, this kanji is so simple it lets you see almost any sort of <b>fire</b> you want to see. It no longer makes a good pictograph, but I invite you to take a pencil and paper and play with the form - first writing it as shown below and then adding lines here and there - to see what you can come up with. Everything from matchbooks to cigarette lighters to volcanic eruptions to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah have been found here. No doubt you, too, will find something interesting to bend your memory around these four simple strokes."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/munia">munia</a>] 22-2-2008(57): For some reason, this kanji reminds me of a person running, her arms (the two drops) raised up, because she caught on<strong> fire</strong>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LoneDeranger">LoneDeranger</a>] 7-2-2009(11): Looks like a flame of a campfire with two <em>drops of</em> sparks flying off.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 9-9-2006(4): (When appearing on the left as in   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/煩">煩</a>   <a href="../163">anxiety</a> <span class="index">(#163 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/煩">煩</a>)</span> and   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/畑">畑</a>   <a href="../166">farm</a> <span class="index">(#166 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/畑">畑</a>)</span>, I use the primitive <em>burning fuse,</em> as in the fuse from the intro to the old Mission: Impossible TV show, which burned from left to right. This helps me keep the<strong> fire</strong> on the left side of the kanji, as the fuse burns towards the field or the head or whatever is on the right of the kanji.).
