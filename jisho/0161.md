heisig: "I don't like it any more than you do, but this kanji is not the pictograph it is trumped up to be: a mound of <b>soil</b> piled on the ground. All I can recommend is that you memorize it as it is. Anyway, it will be occurring with such frequency that you have almost no chance of forgetting it, even if you try."
