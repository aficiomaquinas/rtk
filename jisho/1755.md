## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 24-4-2007(235): To print something with bountiful colour, they use<strong> glossy</strong> paper.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 25-3-2010(37): If you go to have photo’s printed, you may be asked if you would like a matted or<strong> GLOSSY</strong> finish. For nature shots, with BOUNTIFUL COLORS, I would recommend going with<strong> GLOSSY</strong> paper.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 29-12-2006(10): Similar to the previous frame. The<strong> glossy</strong> pages of many magazines are bountiful in &quot;color&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yLaguardia">yLaguardia</a>] 4-7-2012(5): This a special edition of a comic book about the adventures of BENDER and Mr. BEAN (check sindikhara story on <a href="../1443">bountiful</a> (#1443 豊) to see one of the adventures). It would normally be black and white on cheap paper, but being this one a special edition, it was printed COLORED on<strong> GLOSSY</strong> paper and BOUND UP in hard cover.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 2-3-2008(4): Bender thinks he is filthy rich with all his beans. He wont get away from it. Finally they found a way.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 27-4-2010(3): The adverts for <em>bounty</em> bars are always in<strong> glossy</strong> <em>colours</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 19-8-2009(2): If you&#039;ve never heard it before, definitely listen to the song &#039;Alice&#039;s Restaurant&#039; by Arlo Guthrie to help learn this kanji (also becuase it&#039;s a really great and funny song). The cops took <em>bountiful color</em><strong> glossy</strong> photographs, with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tenaciousjay">tenaciousjay</a>] 19-7-2009(2): The new<strong> GLOSSY</strong> Apple monitors supposedly have more BOUNTIFUL COLORS.

I&#039;m black! My skin is naturally<strong> glossy</strong> and they were out of black paint; so I had to use white.&quot; He runs away because he&#039;s afraid of getting arrested for committing an act of racism.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 23-4-2013(1): The<strong> glossy</strong> &#039;male interest&#039; magazines of my youth featured <em>bountiful</em> babes and were in full <em>colour</em>!
