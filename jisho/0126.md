## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Beeber">Beeber</a>] 12-6-2007(238): I find it<strong> strange</strong> that so many people commit suicide in Tokyo by throwing themselves in front of the train. To me when I look at this kanji, I see a train just about to come out of a tunnel, and above the man waiting for his oppourtunity where he can end it all.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 30-7-2007(77): Imagine a ST. BERNARD DOG carrying a CAN instead of a barrel in rescue missions. How<strong> strange</strong>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 12-12-2007(58): A <em>dog</em> that <em>can</em> do the &quot;Can Can&quot; would be a<strong> STRANGE</strong> sight indeed.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hazyjazy">hazyjazy</a>] 25-10-2008(16): Big things can be<strong> strange</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen">Ningen</a>] 29-7-2008(13): This may sound<strong> STRANGE</strong> but if you think <em>big</em> you <em>can</em> do it!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epangelia2k2">epangelia2k2</a>] 11-9-2007(11): What a staggeringly<strong> strange</strong> sight. &#039;The Little Engine That <em>Can</em> (Could)&#039; is still climbing the hill, but now instead of a whistle there is a <em>large St. Bernard</em> perched on the cab. <strong>WOOF * WOOF</strong>.
