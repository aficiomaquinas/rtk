## Heisig story:

&quot;<b>Plump</b>&quot; is one of those delightful English words that almost sound like their meaning. No sooner do you hear it than you think of a round and ample-bodied person falling into a sofa like a <i>large drop</i> of oil plopping into a fishbowl - kerrrr-<b>plump</b>!

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lilpea">lilpea</a>] 3-8-2007(152): A <em>large</em> person with a big <em>drop</em> of sweat dripping off of him because he is so<strong> plump</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 27-2-2006(80): Fat(&quot;plump&quot;) men always have small penises.....the kanji is a combination of &quot;large&quot; with a drop(representing the small penis between his legs).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 28-1-2008(36): A big,<strong> plump</strong> sumo wrestler with a loincloth covering his little drop. (Thanks Fabrice).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 5-2-2006(19): To keep this distinct from the primitive meaning of &quot;round&quot; (&quot;fat man&quot;) I suggest to use a specific image, such as that of a<strong> plump</strong> Japanese sumo wrestler, and let the <em>drop</em> between the legs be the loincloth (which compared to their <em>large</em> body size, is quite a <em>drop</em>). To illustrate the importance of this, have a look at the kanji for &quot;tenacious&quot; (frame 1506) and &quot;burdensome&quot; (frame 1986).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ctalbottclark">ctalbottclark</a>] 8-3-2008(15): The<strong> plump</strong> <em>dog</em> <em>drop</em>ped its tail between its legs.
