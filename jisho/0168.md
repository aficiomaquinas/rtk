heisig: "The kanji for <b>ashes</b> naturally includes the primitive for <i>fire</i>, or more specifically, a <i>fireplace</i>. Now what do you do with that bucket of <b>ashes</b> you have just cleaned out of the <i>fireplace</i>? You walk to the edge of a <i>cliff</i> and tip it upside down, watching as they are swept away in the wind like a swarm of gray mosquitoes. Thus the <i>fire</i>, once it has turned to <b>ashes</b>, ends up at the bottom of the <i>cliff</i>."
