## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 2-2-2006(165): A person <em>pent in</em> is obviously<strong> captured</strong>. Imagine a man put inside a wooden box, his evil capturers waiting for ransom money.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adhmm">adhmm</a>] 13-5-2008(122): Mr. T can&#039;t be<strong> captured</strong>. This kanji is lying.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 6-2-2007(27): They&#039;ve finally <em>pent in</em> <em>Mr. T</em>. But don&#039;t worry; no one can keep T<strong> captured</strong>, foo!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 14-10-2009(23): There is a butt<strong> captured</strong> within this picture. Lol!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/miyadamuraman">miyadamuraman</a>] 25-8-2011(15): This is a very easy kanji. A PERSON who is PENT IN is obviously<strong> captured</strong>. DO NOT USE MR. T! Why people are using this as a primitive element is beyond me. MR. T is the variant of person when it appears on the left side of a kanji. Do not confuse your PERSON and MR. T or you&#039;ll never know which one to use when you have a MR. T story. Keep each version of a primitive distinct in your naming. (Think of the difference between using &quot;heart&quot; and &quot;valentine&quot;).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 16-12-2008(10): Be careful not to confuse with <a href="../1991">captive</a> (#1991 虜). Think in terms of having just<strong> captured</strong> a <em>person</em> by <em>penning</em> them in. (You can toss them in the tiger pit later).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adjnor">adjnor</a>] 16-2-2012(6): Way too easy.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 4-6-2009(5): They tried to <strong>capture</strong> <em>Chuck Norris</em> by <em>penting</em> him <em>in</em>, but <em>Chuck Norris</em> doesn&#039;t get <em>pent in</em> - the <em>pen</em> gets <em>Chuck Norris</em>sed-in. Then, because <em>Chuck Norris</em> cannot be<strong> captured</strong>, he roundhouse-kicked the <em>pen</em> (and this kanji) in the face.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johngwk">johngwk</a>] 3-2-2011(4): A<strong> captured</strong><em> person</em> is <em> pent in</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Earthlark">Earthlark</a>] 16-8-2010(4): <em>Han Solo</em><strong> captured</strong> and <em>pent up</em> in carbonite: <a href="http://philosophistry.com/scans/2009/09/carbonite.jpg">http://philosophistry.com/scans/2009/09/carbonite.jpg</a>. (Recommendation: use another person for this kanji so as not to confuse it with the other person primitive.).
