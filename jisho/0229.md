heisig: "Ah, but haven't modern <i>graveyards</i> become a parody of their ancestors! The flowers are plastic, the writing on the stones is unimaginative and cold, and the whole thing looks more like a marble orchard than a right and proper graveyard. This kanji continues with the modernization trend by picturing <b>imitation</b> <i>trees</i> in the <i>graveyard</i>. But of course, how convenient! They don't need pruning or fertilizing, their leaves don't fall, and they remain the same color all year long. graveyard(cmentarzysko) The element shown here should be taken to represent a modern graveyard. Gone are the cobwebs and gnarled trees, the tilted headstones and dark, moonless nights that used to scare the wits out of our childhood imaginations. Instead, we see brightly colored flowers placed before the tombstones, the sun shining gloriously overhead, and a cuddly St. Bernard sitting at the gate keeping watch. [10]"

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 21-1-2008(149): If I find out this furniture you&#039;re selling me is made of<strong> imitation</strong> <em>wood</em>, I&#039;ll put you in the <em>graveyard</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 15-1-2008(67): The Japanese are so enamored of everything plastic, they even put<strong> IMITATION</strong> plastic <em>trees</em> in their <em>graveyards</em>! (No, not really, but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elanlan">elanlan</a>] 29-12-2009(40): This kanji was a real asshole. No one liked this kanji. That is why that when this kanji died, no one cared, and it received a <em>wooden</em>,<strong> imitation</strong> tombstone; not a fancy marble one, at its resting place in the <em>graveyard</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peepiceek">peepiceek</a>] 14-5-2008(22): The<strong> imitation</strong> <em>tree</em> looked like a <em>big sun flower</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 8-5-2006(21): <strong>imitation</strong>: we left a wodden sculpture (an <strong>imitation</strong>) at the <em>graveyard</em> of our old dog. (<strong>graveyard</strong>: were we put <em>flowers</em> for our deceased <em>big St. Bernard</em>, good ol&#039; <em>Sunny</em>).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 4-5-2007(16): In <em>graveyards</em>, everything is fake, the <em>flowers</em>, the <em>sun</em>, and the little happy <em>dogs</em>. Heck, even the <em>trees</em> are just<strong> imitation</strong>s. It&#039;s a clean aesthetic that&#039;s supposed to help people recover, but all the<strong> imitation</strong> material really unnerves me.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Atomik">Atomik</a>] 30-1-2010(14): I did such a good<strong> imitation</strong> of a <em>tree</em> by staying perfectly still that they sent me to the <em>graveyard</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 12-11-2008(7): Lol @ all the fake<strong> imitation</strong> trees in the graveyard.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 13-11-2009(6): Don&#039;t use<strong> imitation</strong> <em>wood</em> to make crosses for the <em>graveyard</em> (Graveyard primitive - Against a <em>rose</em>y sky, the <em>sun</em> set over the <em>large</em> graveyard.).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 10-10-2007(6): <em>Tree</em>s in <em>graveyard</em>s are part of the attempt to create an<strong> imitation</strong> of heaven for the souls buried there.
