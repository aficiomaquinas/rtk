## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ceryn">Ceryn</a>] 16-4-2008(137): They say that when an INSECT flaps its wings even the single DROP of<strong> WIND</strong> that it creates is sometimes enough to create a hurricane on the other side of the Earth.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 29-1-2008(82): The<strong> WIND</strong> usually carries things around in it - <em>drops</em> of rain or snow, and lots of <em>insects</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 31-8-2007(38): Most people don&#039;t know that<strong> wind</strong> is actually created by a bunch of insects at the end of the earth. They wake up in the morning, twist their fitted blue baseball caps backwards (see it on top of their head?), and get to work flapping their wings as hard as they can, causing the<strong> wind</strong> shockwave to spread in all directions.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/burritokun">burritokun</a>] 28-8-2008(32): Ever heard of the butterfly effect? All it takes is <em>one</em> flap of an insect&#039;s wings to alter the <em>wind</em> patterns around the world. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect</a>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rujiel">Rujiel</a>] 15-8-2009(22): <em>Mediocre insects</em> get caught in the<strong> wind</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brainrobert1">brainrobert1</a>] 6-9-2010(6): <strong>Wind</strong> (primitive) + insect (with drop on top) =<strong> wind</strong> (kanji). My<strong> WIND</strong>screen is covered with INSECT DROPpings.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smujohnson">smujohnson</a>] 16-7-2008(5): Anyone who&#039;s ridden a motorcycle knows that the<strong> wind</strong> hits you with <em>insects</em> like rain <em>drop</em>s.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 6-1-2008(5): I keep confusing the primitive for<strong> wind</strong> and the complete kanji for<strong> wind</strong>. Remember that the complete kanji for<strong> wind</strong> is carrying something - the gnats, while the primitive is empty.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johngwk">johngwk</a>] 2-11-2010(4): A <em>drop</em> in the<strong> wind</strong>- that&#039;s all an <em>insect</em> amounts to.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ellasevia">ellasevia</a>] 22-1-2010(4): When it&#039;s <em>windy</em>, <em>insects</em> will blow around and smash into the<strong> wind</strong>shield of your car, sending <em>drops</em> of <em>insect</em> juices flying all over.
