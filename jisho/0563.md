## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu">ruisu</a>] 14-11-2007(461): Stop | spooning | turkeys. Spoon<strong> female</strong>s. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 25-2-2007(124): To become feminine you must stop using a spoon to eat turkey and use a knife and fork like a proper lady. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-2-2008(50): Tip: <em>stop/footprint</em> + <em>spoon</em> : This combination of primitives appears seven times in Heisig, including as a separate character, which he names <a href="../2043">this here</a> <span class="index">(#2043 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/此">此</a>)</span>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 11-10-2005(43): Oh I love this one, it&#039;s so silly but fun to picture. Imagine a turkey walking in the snow (in the North pole for example) wearing spoons for snowshoes. Turkeys have small feet so they can use spoons as snowshoes, right ? Now you&#039;re looking down at the footprints left by the spoon-wearing turkey who is walking off in the distance, and you think to yourself that those footprints look feminine : curvy and slender. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 13-3-2008(21): Mother to daughter - &#039;You are not a   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/雌">雌</a>  （めす） <strong>female</strong> animal! Now <em>stop</em> <em>sitting on the ground</em> with those <em>turkeys</em>; its not <strong>feminine</strong>!&#039;-----------Building from Katsuo&#039;s tip about how (<em>stop spoon</em>) is used often and later becomes (FRAME 2043)=<em>This here</em>； used for the words ここ、これ＆この maybe we should imagine the daughter｀s name is   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/ここ＝此">ここ＝此</a>  . 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 7-10-2008(11): To keep her <strong>feminine</strong> figure, she knew she had to <em>stop</em> <em>spooning</em> so much <em>turkey</em> during the holidays. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yawfosu88">yawfosu88</a>] 15-8-2007(8): Imagine a feminine <em>turkey</em>, wearing a pink skirt, a pink bow, blonde wig and with big eyelashes, wielding a giant <em>spoon</em> in a very girly fashion, then suddenly wacking a <em>stop sign</em> with it. Imagine the turkey&#039;s feminine grace and style being messed up by doing this, blonde wig to one side, pink skirt all ruffled and fake eyelashes falling out. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ikeda_kat2007">Ikeda_kat2007</a>] 1-10-2007(7): A pregnant, barefoot woman in the kitchen-sooty footprints all over the floor, a large cooking spoon in her hand, and turkey leftovers in front of her.
