1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple">greenapple</a>] 28-8-2006(151): The<strong> waver</strong> for this kanji means to hesitate. I<strong> waver</strong>ed before going into the bar with a bunch of horned wild dogs drinking whiskey straight out of the bottle.

Because of this warning you will surely<strong> waver</strong> as you bring the shot glass to your lips.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bladethecoder">bladethecoder</a>] 2-6-2010(34): I<strong> waver</strong>ed when the <em>pack of wild dogs</em> was blocking the way, but then I drank some <em>Red Bull</em> and charged through. (thanks shakkun).

It puts a pair of <em>horns</em> on a <em>whisky bottle</em> and leaves that behind as a decoy. The dogs don&#039;t fall for the decoy, they see it&#039;s a whisky bottle, but still they<strong> waver</strong>. Should they let their quarry go and just drink the whisky?

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 21-7-2009(8): You&#039;d<strong> waver</strong> too if you came across a pack of <em>wild dogs</em> all hopped up on <em>Red Bull</em>.
