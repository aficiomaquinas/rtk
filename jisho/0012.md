heisig: "This kanji is intended to be a pictograph of the sun. Recalling what we said in the previous frame about round forms, it is easy to detect the circle and the big smile that characterize our simplest drawings of the sun - like those yellow badges with the words, &quot;Have a nice <b>day</b>!&quot; Used as a primitive, this kanji can mean SUN or DAY or A TONGUE WAGGING IN THE MOUTH. This latter meaning, incidentally, derives from an old character outside the standard list meaning something like ""sayeth"" and written almost exactly the same, except that the stroke in the middle does not touch the right side (曰, FRAME 578 曰). SIMPLE  Pictograph of the sun."
