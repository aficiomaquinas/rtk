## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 30-7-2007(245): Many<strong> farm</strong>s are created by first setting FIRE over the land to clear the land for the FIELDS.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 16-7-2007(49): When creating a <strong>farm</strong>, the prospective <strong>farm</strong>er must first set <em>fire</em> to the forest to clear the ground. Only then can he plow the <em>fields</em>. <em>Fire</em> before <em>fields</em> to make a <strong>farm</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kashikoi">kashikoi</a>] 9-1-2009(45): This kanji actually makes a boatload of sense. In Japan, rice<strong> farm</strong>ers are constantly making little fires on their rice<strong> farm</strong>s burning up all the old stalks and things probably to be used as fertilizer. In moving to Japan, I found this practice to be very new and odd to me. So I would venture to guess that&#039;s exactly where this kanji comes from. If not, it certainly makes it really easy to remember.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 5-10-2008(14): Crap! the <em>field</em> in our neighbour&#039;s<strong> farm</strong> is on <em>fire</em>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johngwk">johngwk</a>] 23-6-2010(5): On a Japanese<strong> farm</strong>, <em>fire</em> is often set to the <em>rice</em> fields (after harvest).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta">Dualta</a>] 16-3-2008(4): On<strong> FARM</strong>S things are often <strong>BURNED</strong> in <strong>FIELDS</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mazel">mazel</a>] 29-8-2007(4): [L2]. はたけ. A kaingin<strong> farm</strong> is created by placing the FIELD into FIRE. This would prepare the field for planting.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nijuro">Nijuro</a>] 20-7-2010(3): <em>Fire</em> <em>A</em>nd <em>Ricefield</em> <em>M</em>ake<strong> FARM</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jbudding">jbudding</a>] 16-10-2012(2): They use <em>fire</em> to clear the <em>fields</em> of the<strong> FARM</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SuZumeee">SuZumeee</a>] 5-5-2012(2): If you have a <em>burning</em> passion for <em>ricefields</em> you may want to work at a<strong> farm</strong>.
