## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 24-8-2007(244): Add <em>water</em> THEN the <em>flowers</em>. With <em>both</em> the vase will be <strong>full</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 22-5-2007(128): I was thirsty so I gulped down the <em>water</em>. Then I realized I was also hungry. So I ate the <em>flowers</em>. Yes, I am responsible for <em>both</em> the missing <em>water</em> and the missing <em>flowers</em>. Yes, I&#039;m afraid <em>both</em>. Am I still hungry or thirsty? Thank you for asking! How kind! But no, I feel quite <strong>full</strong> now.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 20-11-2007(67): I hate going on dates where a girl says &quot;I&#039;ll have a <em>salad</em> and a <em>water</em>&quot; and then insists that they <em>both</em> make her<strong> full</strong>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Machine_Gun_Cat">Machine_Gun_Cat</a>] 10-3-2009(45): Just imagine you and your closest Japanese class rival having a contest to see who can get<strong> full</strong> marks ( 満点 ）in a test, the winner is given <em>Flowers</em>, the looser is drenched with ice cold <em>water</em>, now imagine you <em>both</em> get<strong> full</strong> marks and so <em>both</em> of you get drenched and flowered.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 16-7-2006(20): In spring, the <em>water</em> of Kyoto&#039;s waterways is<strong> full</strong> of cherry blossom <em>flowers</em>, right up to the banks on <em>both</em> sides.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 13-1-2008(11): <em>Water</em> is<strong> full</strong> of nutrients that helps <em>flowers</em> grow <em>both</em> tall and pretty :).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 10-1-2009(7): Is water in the cup Half-Full or Half-Empty? BOTH are valid answers.. Just make sure after your useless philosophical discussion that you at least conserve the water by putting it on some flowers.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 3-6-2009(6): Put <em>both water</em> and <em>flowers</em> into the bath. When it&#039;s<strong> full</strong>, you&#039;ll realize what a great combination it is for a romantic night with your lover!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 8-12-2006(6): I take this as water+salad+both. A vegetarian can enjoy himself to the<strong> full</strong> (or get a<strong> full</strong> stomach) if he can get both salad and water.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 4-1-2010(5): &quot;You&#039;re<strong> full</strong> of s***. You did not just drink all that <strong>water</strong> and eat those <strong>flowers</strong>.&quot; &quot;I did eat <strong>both</strong> the flowers, but then I threw up all over. See, there are the rose petals.&quot;.
