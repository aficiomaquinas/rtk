## Reading:

### On-Yomi: シン、ジン &mdash; Kun-Yomi: たつ

## Heisig story:

Cliff . . . two . . . hairpins.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 26-4-2007(273): <strong>Bruce Lee</strong> is such a badass he climbed a sheer vertical <em>cliff</em> using only <em>2 hairpins</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 6-3-2010(39): The kid said &quot;I don&#039;t believe you! Dragons don&#039;t exist!&quot; so we made a little surprise for him: we pinned a huge <strong>dragon </strong> (it was just a <strong>sign</strong> really) on a nearby <em>cliff</em>. &quot;Whoaaa! Dragon!&quot; the kid said. &quot;But why won&#039;t it move?&quot; &quot;I tell you why, cause it&#039;s pinned there with <em>two hairpins</em>&quot; I thought to myself.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 14-1-2006(31): As a primitive I use the image of <em>Bruce Lee</em> .

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 20-3-2009(20): This is the image(sign) of a dragon carved into a <strong>cliff</strong> face. However, the dragon has no eyes. Legend has it that there are <strong>two</strong> magical <strong>hairpins</strong> that can be inserted into the eye sockets to make the dragon come to life.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tryllid">tryllid</a>] 29-12-2008(11): Cliff + two + Hairpins: The<strong> sign of the dragon</strong> was carved into the <em>cliff</em> face with <em>two hairpins</em> that were abandoned in the sand below.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Machine_Gun_Cat">Machine_Gun_Cat</a>] 30-3-2009(7): I use Dragon Ball as a meaning for this as a primitive element.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kioku3">kioku3</a>] 17-10-2009(4): I too already used &quot;Bruce Lee&quot; for <em>shape</em> so I decided to use the beautiful <strong>Zhang Ziyi</strong> (Crouching Tiger, Hidden <strong>Sign of the Dragon</strong>). So with dingomick&#039;s great story, it becomes: <strong>Zhang Ziyi</strong> is such a badass she climbed a sheer vertical <em>cliff</em> using only <em>2 hairpins</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jajaaan">jajaaan</a>] 4-1-2010(3): People born under the<strong> sign of the dragon</strong> are often free spirited, brave and self-assured, resembling the wild and untamed dragon of folklore. However, their disregard for conformity often causes them to rub others the wrong way. In a half-hearted concession, here is a free spirited rock climber (one who scales <em>cliffs</em>) with <em>one single hairpin</em> in her scraggly, untamed hair. PRIMITIVE: either ROCK CLIMBER or NON CONFORMIST.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 18-3-2008(3): Whoops... I already used Bruce Lee for the three scar-like strokes of &quot;shape&quot;. OK, so let&#039;s call this primitive Lara Croft, who in Tomb Raider II is searching for the Dagger of Xian which, when plunged into the heart, turns its victim into the <strong>dragon</strong> (the dagger is thus a<strong> sign of the dragon</strong>). Story: from dingomick; Lara Croft scales the <em>cliff</em> with <em>two</em> <em>hairpins</em> in search of the magical<strong> sign of the dragon</strong>, the Dagger of Xian.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dannyboy4885">dannyboy4885</a>] 1-11-2012(2): In<strong> Sign of the Dragon</strong>, <em>Bruce Lee</em> climbs a sheer vertical <em>cliff</em> using only <em>2 hairpins</em>.
