heisig: "<b>Kudzu</b>&nbsp;is a word taken over from Japanese to name the crawling vines that creep up and completely take over trees. Seeing it at its worst in the Georgia countryside makes it easy to understand why it has a reputation as the &quot;plague of the South.&quot; From there it should not be hard to arrange the primitives, <i>flowers</i>&nbsp;and <i>siesta</i>&nbsp;into a memorable image."

## Heisig story:

<b>Kudzu</b>&nbsp;is a word taken over from Japanese to name the crawling vines that creep up and completely take over trees. Seeing it at its worst in the Georgia countryside makes it easy to understand why it has a reputation as the &quot;plague of the South.&quot; From there it should not be hard to arrange the primitives, <i>flowers</i>&nbsp;and <i>siesta</i>&nbsp;into a memorable image.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 17-5-2008(78): Flower, siesta: The muchacho was not careful. He passed the warning signs and decided to hold a <em>siesta</em> in the<strong> kudzu</strong> field. The<strong> kudzu</strong> grew so fast, he was completely covered by it in a few hours and not able to escape. Now, the<strong> kudzu</strong> <em>flowers</em> mark his grave.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(15): The muchacho takes a <em>siesta</em> under the <em>flowers</em> of the<strong> kudzu</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 11-1-2009(10): <strong>Kudzu</strong> is a <em>flowering</em> plant that never takes a <em>siesta</em>...it grows constantly and has already overtaken most of the southeastern United States. Beware the<strong> kudzu</strong>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aaroncp">aaroncp</a>] 21-2-2011(6): Ok so I don&#039;t know about anyone else, but the bottom part of this kanji does not look like <em>siesta</em> on this site. In the supplement pdf it does, but not here so I came up with this:<strong> Kudzu</strong> vines and <em>flowers</em> grow so fast by <em>day</em> that by night they have <em>bound up</em> all the <em>animal legs</em> in the forest like <em>fish hooks</em> bind fish. It is long and convoluted, but it contains everything similar to the elements here.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amillerchip">amillerchip</a>] 8-1-2012(3): My Windows font is displaying the traditional form of this character, however the bottom primitive is <em>siesta</em> as listed. A couple of links to confirm: <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/845b/browsertest.htm">http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/845b/browsertest.htm</a> <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/%E8%91%9B">http://jisho.org/kanji/details/%E8%91%9B</a> Also I&#039;d never heard of<strong> kudzu</strong> before, so thought I might as well rename this to <strong>くず</strong> and learn the reading too.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 29-5-2009(3): 葛 [つづら] mainly grows in tropical areas such as southern Mexico. We thus can combine learning something useful with the image of a <em>muchacho taking a siesta</em>. 葛 has a neat purple blossoms: the <em>flower</em> on his head makes him look a bit feminine. That&#039;s why the other <em>muchachos</em> make fun of the &quot;sleeping gay&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 25-1-2007(3): A mexican is holding his <em>siesta</em> between the<strong> kudzu</strong> <em>plants</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 11-3-2011(2): 葛 , 葛布 , 葛折り , 葛藤 , 葛餅 , 葛粉 , 葛篭 =葛籠, 葛飾郡 (Katsushika-gun)＊, <a href="../v4/2398">kudzu</a> (#2398 葛) カツ(曷), つづら, くず, かずら ... Parts: 艹, 曷 ... Story:<strong> Kudzu</strong> grows so fast it makes all other <em>Plants</em> look like they are taking a <em>Siesta</em>. The Speedy Gonzalez of the plant world.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 15-1-2009(2): <strong>Khatzumoto</strong> taking a <em>siesta</em> under the<strong> kudzu</strong> <em>flowers</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 15-11-2008(2): When <em>Cheech</em> smokes these flowers, he begins speaking<strong> Kudzu</strong>.
