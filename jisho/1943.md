## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 2-3-2007(202): The original version of the &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot; was about a<strong> crane</strong> who grew up in a <em>turkey coop.</em> All the other <em>birds</em> made fun of it for not having a wattle or a snood or fanning its tail... 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 6-10-2008(72): I ordered a<strong> crane</strong> to move my <em>turkey coop</em>, but they sent me this damn <em>bird</em> instead. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 13-2-2008(47): Do you know how<strong> crane</strong>s came to be? Well, they used to keep the poor <em>bird</em> <em>cooped</em> all the time. But the<strong> crane</strong> really wanted to be free, so it would always streatch its head and neck out of the <em>coop</em> trying to be free. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 5-1-2006(22): The<strong> crane</strong> was the only <em>bird</em> allowed to sleep in the <em>coop</em> (the <em>turkey house</em>). See, the old turkeys deemed the chicken and most of the other <em>birds</em> inferior... but they wouldn&#039;t mess with a majestic<strong> crane</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 15-2-2007(18): During the construction of the <em>Turkey house</em>, there was a mistake and instead of ordering a metal<strong> crane</strong>, they got a <em>bird</em><strong> crane</strong>! Nonetheless, it was happy to help wherever it could. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BooBooQ88">BooBooQ88</a>] 15-12-2009(10): I went into the turkey house to check on my birds but found a<strong> CRANE</strong> instead... WTF. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cheechuan">cheechuan</a>] 19-6-2008(7): The family only realized that the <em>bird</em> that they kept in the <em>turkey coop</em> wasn&#039;t a turkey but a<strong> crane</strong> when they slaughtered it for dinner. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 8-7-2009(5): Imagine a bird using a<strong> crane</strong> to build a strong turkey house. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/parttimeSalaryman">parttimeSalaryman</a>] 29-7-2011(4): The Japanese<strong> crane</strong> was endangered so they raised the <em>birds</em> in <em>turkey coops</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/melchan">melchan</a>] 27-7-2009(4): The<strong> crane</strong> (<em>bird</em>) invaded the <em>turkey house</em> and refused to leave.
