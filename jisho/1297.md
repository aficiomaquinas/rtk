heisig: "This kanji is based on the pictograph of a tree with some branches going upwards and others hanging down, split right down the middle. When that picture's right side is isolated, it becomes the kanji for <b>one-sided</b>, in the sense of only one part of a whole."

## Heisig story:

This kanji is based on the pictograph of a tree with some branches going upwards and others hanging down, split right down the middle. When that picture's right side is isolated, it becomes the kanji for <b>one-sided</b>, in the sense of only one part of a whole.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saranich">saranich</a>] 11-12-2006(282): Fuaburisu&#039;s pictograph of a man kneeling and presenting the ring to his future wife is a<strong> one-sided</strong> version of the story. Others say he was giving her the finger.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 5-2-2006(121): Taking the keyword in the sense of only one part of a whole, I see this as a pictograph of a man kneeling and presenting the ring to his future wife (I couldn&#039;t see any trees or branches in there).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 21-7-2009(45): A<strong> one-sided</strong> romance--he proposes and she says no. (Thanks to fuaburisu).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Odieone">Odieone</a>] 15-12-2008(15): If you look at this image from <strong>one side</strong>, it looks like the <strong>top hat</strong> is floating over a <strong>chair</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 5-1-2010(8): There is also other side (left-side) of the tree, which is the kanji - 爿(radical no. 90, which has the meaning of &quot;piece of wood&quot; and was earlier used in <a href="../v4/239">status quo</a> (#239 状), <a href="../v4/321">robust</a> (#321 壮), <a href="../v4/731">leader</a> (#731 将), but then was simplified to &quot;half-turtle&quot; element). Now put them together - 爿片 - and you can see a tree.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 13-3-2007(8): This is a pictograph of a <em>chair</em> with a figure in a <em>top hat</em> sitting in it. He&#039;s a witness, providing his<strong> one-sided</strong> testimony for the prosecution. This kanji will take the primitive meaning of <em>witness</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 11-3-2013(4): <strong>One-sided</strong> unrequited love. He bends his left leg back slightly (1st stroke), takes the ring out from his pocket (2) and stretches out his arm to proffer (3) it to her whilst bending one knee (4). Too bad she&#039;s having none of it.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 29-3-2011(4): This is a pictograph of a boxer or martial artist in a very<strong> one-sided</strong> match. 片付ける かたづける put in order, tidy up, finish; 鉄片 てっぺん iron scraps; 断片 だんべん fragment.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bej001">bej001</a>] 5-9-2012(3): Here&#039;s a<strong> one-sided</strong> situation: He proposes to her not with a ring but with a top hat. He knows she will never wear it so it will be all his.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asriel">Asriel</a>] 6-4-2009(3): This is a<strong> one-sided</strong> dinner. There&#039;s only one chair sitting at the candle-lit table.
