## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 1-3-2007(144): He&#039;s so <strong>short</strong>, he can&#039;t even throw over a <em>table</em> while playing <em>darts</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 25-11-2008(79): Sort of like ping pong, this kanji represents a game where you throw <em>darts</em> over a <em>table</em> at your opponent. The serve is rarely returned, so the games tend to be<strong> short</strong>.------------ This character apparently refers to duration, not just to height. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sindhikara">sindhikara</a>] 4-1-2009(78): <em>Mr. Bean</em> somehow finds himself in an archery contest. He has no arrow&#039;s so he uses <em>darts</em>, (even though they are quite too<strong> short</strong>!). All of his shots land extremely<strong> short</strong>! (Picture Mr. Bean trying to shoot a dart and it landing<strong> short</strong>). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop">richcoop</a>] 30-6-2009(37): A<strong> short</strong> man can DART under the TABLE. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Angrybeez">Angrybeez</a>] 13-9-2008(22): My<strong> short</strong> friend plays darts, but when he goes to pick them out, he has to climb up on the table we put next to the board. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 11-6-2009(17): My midget friend is so<strong> short</strong> that he can only play <em>darts</em> at the bar if he stands on a <em>table</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 5-9-2006(12): What&#039;s<strong> short</strong>er than a dart? A bean, of course. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 10-4-2006(10): I threw a <em>dart</em> at the dartboard, but it fell<strong> short</strong> and got stuck in the <em>table</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/squeaky_lill_mk">squeaky_lill_mk</a>] 23-5-2009(9): A<strong> short</strong> man threw a <em>dart</em> at <em>Mr Bean</em>. Ouch, with the man being this<strong> short</strong>, imagine where it is going to hurt. . . 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/flameiguana">flameiguana</a>] 3-10-2012(4): <em>Mr. Bean</em> was too<strong> short</strong> to reach the <em>dart</em> that he threw at the board.
