Eye . . . fiber.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 28-5-2007(192): Lots of girls in Japan wear<strong> gauze</strong> patches over one <em>eye</em> made of course white <em>fibers</em>. They think it is cute, and I must admit, I have come to think so too.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 30-8-2006(125): Rocky won the match but left with a nasty <em>eye</em> injury, and needs some<strong> gauze</strong> for it. I use a modified version of the Rocky theme song to remember this one -- &quot;the <em>eye</em> and the <em>fiber</em>&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/testoman">testoman</a>] 10-8-2008(55): The <em>eyes</em> on Spiderman&#039;s mask are made of carbon <em>fibre</em><strong> gauze</strong>. Light, strong and see-through.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eltjopoort">eltjopoort</a>] 13-9-2008(24): <strong>Gauze</strong> is a <em>net</em> of <em>fiber</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 6-12-2006(21): This is also used to mean &quot;web&quot; (e.g. in 網羅 ) and &quot;ordered&quot; (e.g. in 羅列 ). The web meaning is the basic one, and a web consists of fibers and the &quot;eyes&quot; (holes, 網の目 ; like &quot;eye&quot; of a needle) between them.<strong> Gauze</strong> is just a form of web. &quot;Ordered&quot; comes from the order inherent in the matrix formed by the holes. Think of ghastly eyes peeking at you from between the fibers (and fabric of space?) when you&#039;re not looking, and you won&#039;t look webs the same way ever again.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 20-8-2008(10): <strong>Gauze</strong> is what you call the <em>fibrous</em> patch used to protect <em>eye</em> wounds.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rakushun">Rakushun</a>] 14-8-2007(7): A<strong> GAUZE</strong> is a special kind of cloth that the <em>eye</em> can easily see through because of the fabrics special <em>fibers.</em> Unfortunately, <em>Sauron</em> has not been eating much <em>fiber</em> lately and he can&#039;t even see through the<strong> GAUZE</strong> his enemies put under his eye.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bloodge1">bloodge1</a>] 16-8-2012(6): Spiderman got in a fight with a turkey. The turkey pecked at his eye, and now he has to wear a<strong> gauze</strong> over it.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jackwarne">jackwarne</a>] 22-2-2009(6): A<strong> Gauze</strong> is = A NET of FIBERS that you wrap around a wound on your EYE!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei">javiergakusei</a>] 19-9-2007(5): This is a new high-tech<strong> gauze</strong> for your eye injury, says the doctor. It is made of “fiber optics”.
