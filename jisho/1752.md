## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/msukovich">msukovich</a>] 3-6-2008(225): Japanese censorship laws require pornos to use a <em>mosaic</em> screen, so you can&#039;t see what the porno chick is <strong>grasping</strong> with her <em>fingers</em> (but you can assume, neetch). 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tristanthorn">tristanthorn</a>] 18-3-2009(139): Your <em>fingers</em><strong> grasp</strong> the <em>Rubic&#039;s cube</em>... if only your brain could too. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 17-5-2007(43): <em>Mosaic</em> primative = <em>rubic&#039;s cube</em>. Here <em>Shrek</em><strong> grasp</strong>s his <em>Rubic&#039;s cube</em> trying to get a<strong> grasp</strong> on how it&#039;s done. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 2-3-2007(25): The <em>Rubik&#039;s Cube</em> keeps slipping out of my <em>finger&#039;s</em><strong> grasp</strong> every time I try to turn it. One of the children must have been playing with it earlier... 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 2-8-2009(22): To me, the &#039;mosaic&#039; primitive looks just like a <em>computer mouse</em>. (<strong>Grasp</strong>ing your <em>fingers</em> around the <em>computer mouse</em>.). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 11-5-2006(10): You’re redesigning your bathroom and decide to use small glass tiles to make a MOSAIC. Your FINGERS are in the box of tiles fishing for just the right color. When you see it, you<strong> GRASP</strong> it and glue it onto the wall. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ivantolearnkanji">ivantolearnkanji</a>] 28-4-2008(6): <em>Mosaic</em> primitive = <em>Rubik&#039;s Snake</em>, which was released following the initial success of Rubik&#039;s Cube. It didn&#039;t have the huge success of the Cube but was MUCH easier for people to<strong> grasp</strong>, intellectually or with their fingers. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mairov">mairov</a>] 13-3-2008(6): You are not seeing colors   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/色">色</a>   in this kanji becos your fingers are not correctly<strong> grasp</strong>ing the kaleidoscope   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/巴">巴</a>  . 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 5-3-2012(4): <em>fingers</em><strong> grasp</strong> at the pieces of the <em>mosaic</em> (don&#039;t confuse with <a href="../3022">clasp</a> <span class="index">(#3022 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/摯">摯</a>)</span>). 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 1-7-2009(4): My fingers cannot<strong> grasp</strong> the mosaic that is the rubix cube.
