## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bluestocking">bluestocking</a>] 18-9-2007(335): Behind closed DOORS, the TASKMASTER tortures to get prisoners to open their MOUTHS and<strong> DISCLOSE</strong> information. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 19-6-2007(62): You signed a non-<strong>disclosure</strong> agreement with the <em>taskmaster</em> but you opened your mouth as soon as you got out the <em>door</em>! 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 29-12-2007(31): It&#039;s best not to<strong> disclose</strong> what you were forced to do with your <em>mouth</em> behind closed <em>doors</em> for your <em>taskmaster</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 3-4-2010(15): Before they go out of the <em>door</em>, the <em>taskmaster</em> makes everyone sign non-<strong>disclosure</strong> forms to keep on top of the possibility that they might open their <em>mouths</em>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 18-10-2005(11): A closed <em>door</em> refuses to<strong> disclose</strong> (dis-close) whatever is happening behind, so someone asked the <em>taskmistress</em> to whip the <em>door</em>, and force it to reveal/disclose what is going on behind. The <em>door</em> gives up (who can resist the <em>taskmistress</em>, hehe) and<strong> disclose</strong>s the information by way of a <em>mouth</em> that appears, just like that (even in imaginary world, doors need a <em>mouth</em> to talk). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 1-12-2008(5): A press conference. &quot;Sorry, we can&#039;t<strong> disclose</strong> that information right now,&quot; says the politician. He then runs behind a <em>door</em> and a security guard(<em>taskmaster</em>) moves to block the door. The reporters <em>mouths</em> blabber away, but they don&#039;t get any answers to their questions. (picture as if on TV, so the reporters are down at the bottom and the camera&#039;s focus is on the closed door and security guard above). 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penot">penot</a>] 30-10-2008(5): Marsellus, (the big black guy chasing Bruce Willis in Pulp Fiction) was forced to do something terrible behind &#039;<strong>close</strong>&#039;d <em><strong>d</strong>oors</em> for the <em>taskmaster</em> ; after the odeal, he said, &quot; Don&#039;t <strong>d</strong>is&#039;<strong>close</strong>&#039; this to anyone <em>O</em><strong>K</strong>!(<em>mouth</em>+<strong>ケイ</strong>), Not a <em>mouth</em> to anyone!, <em>O</em><strong>ケイ</strong>!&quot; // <strong>ケイ qi3 계 (gye)</strong>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enerccio">enerccio</a>] 4-8-2009(4): <em>Taskmaster</em> is guarding the <em>door to his left</em>, so no <em>mouths</em> inside can<strong> disclose</strong> some company secrets... 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/drivers99">drivers99</a>] 19-6-2009(4): I immediate thought of the movie &quot;Disclosure&quot; (1994, starring Demi Moore and Michael Douglas). Behind closed doors the taskmistress (Demi Moore) warned Michael Douglas to keep his mouth shut if he wanted to keep his job. Here&#039;s a trailer of the movie: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih2-TLzLjgk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih2-TLzLjgk</a>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KanjiHantaa">KanjiHantaa</a>] 26-5-2013(3): Los trabajadores se pusieron a <strong>manifestar</strong> en la <em>puerta</em> de la compañía en contra de su <em>capataz</em> porque no les dejaba abrir la <em>boca</em> en horas de trabajo.
