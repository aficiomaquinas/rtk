## Heisig story:

Box . . . human legs.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 26-2-2008(176): This kanji is used commonly as a <strong>counter for small animals</strong>. This is a pictograph of a SMALL ANIMAL&#039;S view from inside a CARDBOARD BOX looking out at his masters HUMAN LEGS. He&#039;s probably hiding so the master does not COUNT him with the other animals which will probably be eaten (thus he avoids everyones<strong> EQUAL</strong> fate on the farm: the kitchen table).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 21-7-2008(97): Put a <em>box</em> over everyone&#039;s heads, letting only the <em>legs</em> show, and we all look pretty much<strong> equal</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 30-6-2006(58): Imagine a magician doing that trick where he puts his assistant in a <em>box</em> and proceeds to saw her in half. Don’t the <em>human legs</em> sticking horizontally out of the <em>box</em> remind you of an<strong> equal</strong> sign?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alantin">alantin</a>] 10-7-2008(32): Four minus one stroke is<strong> equal</strong> to..?

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 16-8-2009(28): <em>4 - 1</em> <strong>=</strong> this kanji.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 9-2-2007(20): Imagine in Orwell&#039;s &quot;Animal farm&quot; that one of the top animals secretly keeps a pair of <em>human legs</em> in a <em>box</em>. When alone, he sometimes puts them on, saying &quot;All animals are <strong>equal</strong>, but some are more <strong>equal</strong> than others&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 13-10-2005(19): This kanji is also a counter for small animals, but for the meaning that James Heisig chose it is to be understood as : to be the<strong> equal</strong> of, to be a match for, to rival with. Picture a human trying to be a match to a four-legged extraterrestrial. The latter tells the human &quot;If you want to be my<strong> equal</strong>, you&#039;ll have to bring another pair of <em>human legs</em>&quot;. Which the human does, carrying them in a big <em>tupperware box</em> so they stay fresh (to be grafted on, who knows...).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 21-4-2009(16): <em>Solid Snake</em> has met his<strong> equal</strong>. Across the room he can see another <em>box</em> with a pair of <em>human legs</em> sticking out.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 29-10-2010(7): 匹敵 , 馬匹 <a href="../v4/1695">equal</a> (#1695 匹) ヒツ, ひき ... Parts:匚, 儿 ... Story: As noted, this is the <strong>Counter for Animals</strong> with a leg count<strong> Equal</strong> to <em>Four</em>. This Kanji covers most animals in most circumstances. IRL, even Japanese people don&#039;t know how to count things properly in Japanese: There are specific counters for Squid, Dolphins, Crabs, certain kinds of fish, cows, horses, etc., but Japanese people use 匹 (or 疋 ) for most of them anyway. 疋 <a href="../v4/2098">critters</a> (#2098 疋) means reads the same.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 4-12-2008(7): Put a box over everyone&#039;s heads, letting only the legs show, and we all look pretty much<strong> equal</strong>.
