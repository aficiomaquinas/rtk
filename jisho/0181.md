heisig: The key word <b>den</b> refers to an animal lair hollowed out in the side of a mountain. Now if we keep to the image of the monastic life as an image for <i>same</i>, we can picture a <b>den</b> of wild beasts dressed up in habits and living the common life in a mountain cavern. To bring in the element of <i>water</i> we need only give them a sacred "puddle" in the center of their <b>den</b>, the focus of all their pious attentions.
