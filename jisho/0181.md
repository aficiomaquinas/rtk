## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 27-7-2007(226): The FORTUNE TELLER was burned by FLAMES on the<strong> spot</strong> because she was accused of being a witch.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/etpan">etpan</a>] 12-6-2008(138): You have to stimulate the G-spot with your <em>magic wand</em> in order to get her on <em>fire</em>. Or you can juste use your <em>mouth</em>...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/noushina">noushina</a>] 23-11-2012(33): The <em>Fortune Teller</em> stares into an <em>Campfire</em> until she sees <strong>SPOTS</strong>. She then interprets those<strong> spot</strong>s in the same manner than another fortune teller would look at tea leaves or the bumps on your head.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix">kaminix</a>] 2-3-2008(14): Alternate meaning of the kanji is <strong>mark</strong>, or <strong>points</strong>. Like japanese tests are graded from 0 to 100 depending on how many <strong>percent</strong> of the questions they got correct. Before I learned any alternate meaning to this I took it as <strong>percentage</strong> = statistics. Now, wouldn&#039;t some pure and concrete <strong>statistics</strong> be just the thing you need to set that <em>fortune tellers</em> mind on <em>fire</em>? Relate the setting him/her on fire to the entry for <a href="../v4/163">anxiety</a> (#163 煩) if it helps. :).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 29-3-2008(10): &quot;Out damn<strong> spot</strong>!&quot; Yelled the crazy <em>fortune teller</em> as she leaped into the <em>fire</em>. I guess thats not quite how it happened in Hamlet though, so I got a low <strong>mark</strong> on my English test.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu">ruisu</a>] 7-9-2007(7): We took a<strong> spot</strong> around the fire and listened to the fortune-teller.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/solarmist">solarmist</a>] 27-10-2008(6): The fortune tell pointed at a<strong> spot</strong> in the fire.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skakanka">skakanka</a>] 18-4-2012(5): This kanji also means grade, or %. <em>てん</em> A student at an exam is like a <em>fortune teller</em>, <em>fired</em> up by enthusiasm and eagerness to get a good grade, red <em>spots</em> lit up on his face from the excitement.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BobDG">BobDG</a>] 4-9-2010(5): The fortune teller was thrown into flames on the<strong> spot</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaoskastle">kaoskastle</a>] 31-12-2008(5): Meet<strong> Spot</strong>, the four-legged, fortune-telling dog!
