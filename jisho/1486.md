## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 28-6-2006(205): A<strong> two-mat area</strong> is just about as much <em>ground</em> as you will need for a <em>lily</em> pond. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 21-1-2008(114): A<strong> two-mat area</strong> is plenty of space for sleeping in a tent but you won&#039;t be comfortable unless the <em>ground</em> is <em>even</em>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 5-3-2006(30): A<strong> two-mat area</strong> is exactly how much ground a giant lilypad will cover. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 27-2-2008(21): Place the two mats on the <em>ground</em> <em>even</em>ly to get a<strong> two-mat area</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Weber">Weber</a>] 21-2-2007(15): Since one full tatami mat&#039;s length is twice as long as its width, a two mat area would create an even, square floorspace: a somewhat more convenient unit of measuring the ground. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 1-2-2008(8): While staying with a friend in a room the size of a<strong> two-mat area</strong>, the <em>ground</em> was divided <em>evenly</em>, yet it still felt unfair that I had to stay on my mat&#039;s side. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tom2000">tom2000</a>] 29-10-2010(6): The world largest waterlily, the magnificent Victoria Amazonica, is 3m in diameter, covering about the same amount of ground as 2 tatami mats! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_%28waterlily%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_%28waterlily%29</a>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aikou">Aikou</a>] 7-9-2006(4): Für einen Teich für <em>Seerosen</em> muss man mindestens eine <em>Boden</em>fläche in der Größe zweier Tatami einplanen (<em>Tsubo</em>), dort muss man dann den <em>Boden</em> so bearbeiten, dass die empfindlichen Seerosen wachsen können. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 24-1-2010(3): <em>Kermit the Frog</em> and I were doing yoga on a<strong> two-mat area</strong>. He was clumsy and kept kicking me. Eventually, I gave up and did my yoga on the <em>dirty ground</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 21-1-2008(3): Ancients believed in 4 elements: earth, water, wind, and fire. In a small garden, the size of a<strong> two-mat area</strong>, two separate compartments have been devoted to the elements earth (<em>soil</em>) and water (with <em>water lilies</em>). (The other elements air and fire are too ephemeral to be captured in a garden.).
