## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(154): Stroke order: I like to think of the first two strokes as “chop sticks” with which one eats the<strong> rice</strong>. The rest then is the “tree” meaning “plant” in this contexct. also: USA.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 19-12-2007(52): Two <em>drops</em> of<strong> rice</strong> in a <em>tree</em>, simple.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inaka_rob">inaka_rob</a>] 17-4-2012(23): 88! Japanese people think of this Kanji as 88. Each grain of<strong> rice</strong> holds 88 gods inside. Anyway, that is the origins of this kanji. It&#039;s easy to remember: Each grain of<strong> rice</strong> holds 88 gods. 八十八 written as one character. just remember one 八 is upside down.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 29-9-2006(10): Avoid <em>rice-grains</em> in stories that use the full 6-stroke 米 , use cups of<strong> rice</strong> instead. Reserve <em>rice-grains</em> for the abbreviated 5-stroke version as in <a href="../932">lacquer</a> (#932 漆)漆 and <a href="../933">Esq.</a> (#933 様)様.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rinkuhero">rinkuhero</a>] 20-9-2011(9): <strong>Rice</strong> grows on trees in America.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog">stupiddog</a>] 8-8-2009(6): Condoleezza <em>Rice</em> was a Secretary of State of the <em>USA</em> (the 2nd primitive meaning of this Kanji).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Okonomiyaki">Okonomiyaki</a>] 27-1-2008(5): Not too long ago, most people from the <strong>US</strong> were not able to use chopsticks properly. Thinking that the sticks were supposed to <em>cross</em>, they found themselves <em>dropping</em> <strong>rice</strong> all over the place.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 3-10-2006(4): I use Condi<strong> Rice</strong> as personification for the primitive.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 4-6-2010(3): Trivia: besides being shorthand for America/亜<strong>米</strong>利加/<strong>米</strong>国, 米 means &quot;lucky 88&quot;. Henshall says (in the entry for 寿 , ＃1351, p. 431): &quot;Note that eighty-eight is considered a particularly felicitous age, owing to the fact that the character for<strong> rice</strong> (a symbol of bounty and the life-force), 米 ..., can be graphically interpreted as ten 十 ..., times eight [upside-down] ハ..., with a further eight ハ...&quot; 米寿 【べいじゅ】88th birthday. (Cf. inaka_rob&#039;s story, and mine for 寿 <a href="../1565">longevity</a> (#1565 寿)).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 31-12-2007(3): When trees get horny they reproduce and have a litter of<strong> rice</strong> (believe me, i&#039;m a treeologist).
