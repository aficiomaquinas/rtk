## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu">ruisu</a>] 26-11-2007(231): The <em>talk</em> was so boring the<strong> audience</strong> took a <em>siesta</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 30-10-2008(59): Note: The keyword meaning is &quot;Have an<strong> audience</strong> with . . . (Pope, King, etc)&quot;. Story: When you arrive for your<strong> audience</strong> with the Pope, he appears to be dozing. His assistant says, &quot;Sorry about your<strong> audience</strong>, but you won&#039;t get a <em>word</em> out of him while he&#039;s having his <em>siesta</em>&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/GenPDP7">GenPDP7</a>] 20-12-2007(36): The man talking during his siesta (in his sleep) is saying strange things and drawing an<strong> audience</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lasercorn">lasercorn</a>] 5-6-2008(24): A good<strong> audience</strong> doesn&#039;t <em>talk</em> or take a <em>siesta</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FuDaWei">FuDaWei</a>] 30-5-2010(10): The Pope granted an<strong> AUDIENCE</strong> to the entire Mexican village, but since he didn&#039;t <em>talk</em> in Spanish, it quickly turned into a mass <em>siesta</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stevieman">Stevieman</a>] 19-3-2010(8): If you break up SIESTA into <em>tongue wagging in mouth</em>, <em>bound up</em>, <em>sitting man</em>, you have somewhat the image of a prisoner begging. This gives you the general sense of <em>BEGGAR</em>. Using <em>BEGGAR</em> as a primitive is better I think. A <a href="../v4/451">thirst</a> (#451 渇) beggar begs for water. A <em>BEGGAR SPEAKS</em> requesting an<strong> audience</strong>(to beg for money), a beggar&#039;s garments are usually <a href="../v4/453">brown</a> (#453 褐)(dirty), and beggars sleep so much when they open their mouth, their voice is <a href="../v4/454">hoarse</a> (#454 喝). (btw, chinese etymology: the bottom part of siesta means to beg).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tritonxg">tritonxg</a>] 11-2-2010(3): [FR]audience N1 <strong>ETSU </strong> k&amp;k:1920 <em>mot+soleil+paquet +cuillere</em> <strong>audience solennelle :</strong> lors d&#039;une<strong> AUDIENCE</strong> solennelle les bons orateurs usent de MOTS brillants comme le SOLEIL qui bien qu&#039;EMPAQUETES n&#039;y vont pas moins avec le dos de la CUILLERE 謁する 【えっする】to have an<strong> audience</strong> with 謁を賜わる 【えつをたまわる】to be granted an<strong> audience</strong>謁見【えっけん】audience (with someone) 内謁 【ないえつ】private<strong> audience</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peacemik">peacemik</a>] 7-6-2008(3): If you have an<strong> audience</strong> with the emperor, it&#039;s good protocol not to <em>talk</em> till you are spoken with. And not to have a <em>siesta</em> during the<strong> audience</strong>. Sense of &quot;audience with someone in authority&quot; vs. &quot;audience at a performance&quot;. (Thanks to dwhitman and lasercorn).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 30-10-2006(3): Imagine the first part of <em>Return of the Jedi</em>. There&#039;s a big room where <em>speeches</em> are made, but the desert sun is so hot that everyone is just taking a <em>siesta</em>. The room is Jabba the Hutt&#039;s main<strong> audience</strong> chamber, of course.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 7-12-2005(3): Socrates (see <em>say</em>) gets an<strong> audience</strong> in the royal chamber but finds everyone there is taking a siesta.
