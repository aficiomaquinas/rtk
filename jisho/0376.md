## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 25-2-2008(314): A<strong> CURRICULUM</strong> is a <em>calendar</em> that replaces days with reasons to <em>stop</em> having fun.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 19-1-2007(96): A little like a <em>calendar</em>, your <strong>CV</strong> records your <em>footsteps</em> through time.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 17-10-2011(91): A<strong> curriculum</strong> (vitae) is similar to a <em>calendar</em> except that, instead of mentioning every <em>day</em> in your life, it only mentions the main <em>stop</em>s. (Compare <a href="../213">calendar</a> (#213 暦)).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 25-8-2007(25): Stop underneath a grove of trees by the cliffs to sit down and write your CV.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TwoGoats">TwoGoats</a>] 6-9-2009(20): When the school<strong> CURRICULUM</strong> started covering TREES that grow in cliffs, I decided to STOP attending.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 3-10-2007(14): Because the Japanese class<strong> curriculum</strong> required sooooo much memorization, I promised myself that I would stop smokin trees for a couple months. I broke down about 2 hours later though and ran from the classroom to under a nearby cliff where I puffed tuff like always.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix">kaminix</a>] 3-4-2008(10): Relate to the kanji for <em>calendar</em>. Here you&#039;ve replaced the primitive for <em>day</em> with the one for <em>stopping</em>. As you write your <strong>curriculum</strong> you might want to go through your old <em>calendars</em>, <em>stopping</em> at the most important <em>days</em> and noting them down.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 15-6-2008(6): 歴 【れき】 (suf) history of; experience of. 歴史 【れきし】 (n) history; (P) 学歴 【がくれき】 (n) academic background; (P) STORY: A scientist is interested in the HISTORY of a particular CLIFF where a small GROVE just STOPPED growing. Could it be the power plant down the road?

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/haus9tus">haus9tus</a>] 6-2-2012(5): A <strong>curriculum</strong> (vitae) is like a <em>calendar</em> (#213 暦), but instead of mentioning every <em>day</em> in your life, it mentions only the main <em>stop</em>s.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ZxHIROxZ">ZxHIROxZ</a>] 24-6-2012(4): At Extreme Schooling, our<strong> curriculum</strong> includes <em>cliff</em> diving, <em>grove</em> climbing, and time <em>stopping</em>.
