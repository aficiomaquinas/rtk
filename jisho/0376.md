## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 10-10-2007(289): A PETA activist <em>speaks</em> at a <em>meeting</em> of <em>butchers</em> to<strong> rebuke</strong> them.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 16-3-2008(54): I imagine <em>Socrates</em> gate-crashing a <em>meeting of butchers</em> and REBUKING them: &#039;You&#039;ve been killing things again; you have, haven&#039;t you?&#039; while the embarrassed butchers blush and try to hide their knives behind their backs and stand in front of hanging sides of beef.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sannomiya">sannomiya</a>] 26-2-2007(36): I had to SPEAK to the MEETING OF BUTCHERS and<strong> REBUKE</strong> them for mad cow disease, e-coli, and the bird flu.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jshield1">jshield1</a>] 23-4-2009(18): To<strong> rebuke</strong> is to take what someone <em>says</em>, and <em>butcher</em> it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 14-6-2008(9): 諭す 【さとす】 (v5s,vt) to admonish; to persuade; to warn; to remonstrate; (P) STORY: Be careful what you SAY at the BUTCHERS MEETING because they only give you one WARNING and then you become part of a hot dog.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg">johanvg</a>] 9-8-2006(8): To<strong> rebuke</strong> means to meet someone&#039;s words with butchering.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 9-6-2008(6): The <em>words</em> of her<strong> rebuke</strong> stung like a <em>saber meeting the flesh</em>! Ouch...

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 28-5-2013(5): Keep getting this wrong so I looked at the origin of the word and it may be Old French <strong>rebuchier</strong>. The French health minister <em>speaks</em> at a <em>meeting</em> of British <em>butchers</em> to give them a good old <em>rebuchier</em> (<strong>rebuke</strong> them). His <em>words</em> of<strong> rebuke</strong> are mainly about how their sloppy butchering practices gave the world BSE (mad cow disease). <a href="../340">chastise</a> (#340 討) is more associated with an adult to a child and with criticism and corporal punishment and <a href="../336">admonish</a> (#336 警) I think of as coming from an <em>awe</em> inspiring superior.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ecdrewello1">ecdrewello1</a>] 29-7-2012(4): Dexter almost always verbally<strong> rebuke</strong>s his victims when they are under his &quot;roof&quot;, on his table, and then inevitably the flesh slicing begins.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 6-3-2009(4): The butcher&#039;s stern<strong> rebuke</strong> cuts like knives in my flesh. The butcher<strong> rebuke</strong>d me because I came to the meeting without my vehicle and offered excuses (words) instead.
