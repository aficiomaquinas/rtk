heisig: That same <i>grove of trees</i> we met in frame 226 shows up here in the character for <b>curriculum</b> (in the sense of a record of one's life or academic achievements, the <b>curriculum</b> vitae). Instead of the <i>grove</i> making its way slowly through the surface of the <i>cliff</i> as before, here we see it <i>stopped</i>, much the same as a <b>curriculum</b> vitae calls a halt to the calendar and talks only about the past.
