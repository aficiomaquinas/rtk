It&#039;s a flower with a mouth and it grows up out of a pipe! Seems to make sense to me. But instead of regular Mario you have Socrates! So here is what is going on. Two Piranha Plants are<strong> discreet</strong>ly discussing when they will come up out of their pipes to hit Socrates. They have to talk<strong> discreet</strong>ly however becuase Socrates is standing right next to their pipes.

The advertisement promises &quot;discreet packaging! No one but you will know what&#039;s inside.&quot; The package arrives in a plain brown paper box with no <em>words</em> on the outside - very<strong> discreet</strong> indeed. And, what&#039;s more, when you open the package, you see a <em>cabbage</em>. The &quot;toys&quot; are hidden inside the cabbage for another layer of<strong> discreet</strong>ness.
