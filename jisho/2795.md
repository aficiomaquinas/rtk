## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 29-7-2009(72): Your<strong> chin</strong> is the part of your <em>head</em> under your <em>nostrils</em> that forms the <em>double snare</em> that is your jaw. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 31-8-2007(21): Left side is <em>crocodile</em> primative. <em>crocodile&#039;s head&#039;s</em> most prominent feature is his <strong>jaw</strong>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 17-7-2007(14): <em>Both</em> my friend&#039;s and my <em>mouths</em> dropped open when we saw a person&#039;s <em>head snared</em> up to the <em>ceiling</em> by his<strong> chin</strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cb4960">cb4960</a>] 7-2-2009(6): <em>Two mouths</em> are attached to the <em>ceiling</em> with a long tongue hanging down ready to <em>snare</em> someone&#039;s <em>head</em>. This is why you should always have a positive attitude and keep your <strong>chin</strong> up (so you can avoid these kinds of things). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 29-11-2008(5): After I got my <em>head</em> caught in <em>double snares</em>, it looked like my<strong> chin</strong> had <em>two mouths</em>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 5-2-2011(4): Poor guy. He tried scratching his pet <a href="../2824">alligator</a> <span class="index">(#2824 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/鰐">鰐</a>)</span> under the<strong> chin</strong> and ended up losing his <em>head</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mirnkaya">mirnkaya</a>] 18-4-2012(3): This <em>page</em> summarizes the story of <strong>JAWS</strong>, the shark which ate <em>two mouthfuls</em> of humans and was killed by <em>one</em> unlikely <em>snare</em> - the pressurized scuba tank he swallowed - that was blown in its mouth by the hero. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 3-2-2011(2): A man-eating alien with <em>two mouths</em>---he hides <em>one</em> with a beard that&#039;s really a <em>snare</em>, and when he goes to eat people, his whole <em>head</em> flips back at the<strong> chin</strong>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 22-5-2009(2): The left part looks like a picture for me (okay, maybe I hallucinate, but try it): <em>two eyes</em>, a <em>nose</em> (the horizontal stroke) and the <em>snare</em> depicting the<strong> chin</strong>: an open mouth, as if loughing out loud. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tguk911">tguk911</a>] 3-12-2012(1): The man got surgery on his <em>head</em> and got a wider<strong> chin</strong> so he could install another mouth. The <em>two mouths</em> share one <em>tongue</em> though cause he didn&#039;t have enough money to buy another one. But since he has another mouth he can en<em>snare</em> double the amount of food that he used to.
