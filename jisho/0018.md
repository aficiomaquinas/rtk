heisig: Remember when you were young and your mother told you never to look directly into the <i>sun</i> for fear you might burn out your <i>eyes</i>? Probably you were foolish enough to <b>risk</b> a quick glance once or twice; but just as probably, you passed that bit of folk wisdom on to someone else as you grew older. Here, too, the kanji that has a <i>sun</i> above and an <i>eye</i> right below looking up at it has the meaning of <b>risk</b> (see frame 12).
