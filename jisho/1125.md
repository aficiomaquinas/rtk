## Heisig story:

<i>A banner</i> . . . <i>a zoo</i>. Hint: think of a merry-go-round.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 13-2-2006(248): A merry-go-round with a big <em>banner</em> on top and below a veritable zoo of bakelite animals on poles in perpertual<strong> rotation</strong> accompanied by silly music. Giraffes, elephants, zebras, rhinos...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 25-10-2007(135): Don&#039;t confuse with revolve or axis! Think of<strong> rotation</strong> as a<strong> rotation</strong> of animals in the <em>zoo</em> - some are on display (in<strong> rotation</strong>), some are in cages in the back (out of<strong> rotation</strong>). The ones currently in<strong> rotation</strong> (on display) are advertised with a large <em>banner</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bennyb">bennyb</a>] 3-6-2009(38): I had trouble remember this with previous zoo-banner-rotation stories, so here is something a bit more vivid: The future of ZOO technology: There is a giant Ferris Wheel-type contraption with individual plastic cages, each with an animal that ROTATES every 10 minutes. It&#039;s built half-way into the ground, can you envision it? The lazy people who watch wouldn&#039;t know what animal was what without the colorful BANNERS that accompany each cage.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 17-12-2008(17): The zoo is now open and the electric BANNER that says &quot;ZOO&quot; is in full<strong> rotation</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CarolinaCG">CarolinaCG</a>] 7-8-2009(6): The zoo banner rotates.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 29-1-2008(6): <em>Banners</em> at the <em>zoo</em> are reading &quot;Come watch our animals get high and f**k up the<strong> rotation</strong>!&quot; A comedy show for the whole family on their day at the zoo.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rakushun">Rakushun</a>] 12-6-2007(4): I imagine a merry-go-round at the zoo rotating so fast that a nearby banner gets sucked into it, wrapping itself around the kids and causing havoc. All because of the<strong> rotation</strong> of the merrygoround.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 20-3-2007(4): The BANNERS<strong> ROTATION</strong> shows everyone that a ZOO is near by.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LunaSlave">LunaSlave</a>] 1-5-2012(3): A <em>banner</em> is hung at the Tokyo <em>Zoo</em> advertising an upcoming AKB48 concert. They&#039;re sure to play their hit single &quot;Heavy<strong> Rotation</strong>&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 20-6-2010(3): <strong>Rotation</strong> of kids with their assorted <em>banners</em> from one <em>zoo</em> animal on merry-go-round to another (felt it necessary to distinguish<strong> rotation</strong> from <a href="../v4/420">revolve</a> (#420 転), so I have the kids rotating rather than the merry-go-round, which could also be said to revolve).
