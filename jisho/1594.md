## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 13-3-2007(308): The<strong> preface</strong> to all human history was written <em>beforehand</em> in <em>caves</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 29-1-2008(45): Rename the &quot;beforehand&quot; part to be <em>glove</em> (because you have to wear <em>gloves</em> beforehand if you want to wield the halberd, which is why this primitive is an incomplete halberd). The story: a winter morning. A textbook author is holed up in his tiny office, a veritable <em>cave</em>. He wants to start his masterpiece textbook by first writing the<strong> preface</strong>. But he can&#039;t get started. He sits and stares at empty paper until evening. It gets cold and he puts on <em>glove</em>s, shivering, but still unable to start his<strong> preface</strong>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 10-6-2009(41): In the<strong> preface</strong> to his latest edition of RTK, Heisig tells us that until he invented his brilliant kanji-learning method, he was living in a <em>cave beforehand</em>. Luckily, the publishing of the book gave him enough money to move out of the <em>cave</em> into an apartment. He could also finally afford to put a handle on his <em>halberd</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lankydan">lankydan</a>] 30-11-2007(9): Read<strong> preface</strong> on the <em>cave beforehand</em> or you&#039;ll be sorry... 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 24-1-2010(7): I suck at <em>tennis</em> so I picked up a book by Roger Federer. The<strong> preface</strong> tells how he was so awesome that he managed to defeat a <em>cave wall</em> in a one-on-one <em>tennis</em> match. The cave wall eventually gave up and collapsed. The rest of the book was about boring <em>tennis</em> strategies. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tryllid">tryllid</a>] 23-10-2008(7): Cave + Beforehand: The<strong> preface</strong> to the book - is really the <em>cave</em> entrance to the book where <em>beforehand</em> someone gives you directions on how to navigate the book. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gaignun">Gaignun</a>] 29-12-2010(5): (From FudoMyo) Historians were about to write the<strong> preface</strong> of human history before realizing that it had all been written <em>beforehand</em> in <em>caves</em>, so they saved time and didn&#039;t bother. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shoopa">shoopa</a>] 25-10-2010(3): We all know Heisig for writing about remembering kanji, but most people don&#039;t know that beforehand, he spent a couple years as a spelunker (exploring <em>caves</em>). He wrote about it in the<strong> preface</strong> to the first edition, but the editor took it out because it wasn&#039;t at all related. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavin.schultz-ohkubo">gavin.schultz-ohkubo</a>] 18-6-2010(3): The<strong> preface</strong> to all human history was written <em>beforehand</em> in <em>caves</em>. Indeed, <em>before hands</em> were capable of even writing. [+1 FudoMyo]. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/manubear">manubear</a>] 5-5-2012(2): In ancient times - ie. the<strong> preface</strong> to modern history - <em>Genghis Khan</em> used to live in a <em>cave</em>. That&#039;s where he stored all his broken halberds (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/秩序">秩序</a>  ,   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/序文">序文</a>  ,   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/序列">序列</a>  ).
