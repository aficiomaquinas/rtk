## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 12-10-2008(114): I wanted a convertible so I <strong>chopped off</strong> the top of my <em>car</em> with an <em>axe</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 30-9-2007(43): A &quot;chop shop&quot; is a place where stolen <em>cars</em> are taken, and parts <strong>chopped off</strong> with an <em>axe</em>, to be sold.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 24-11-2008(23): Picture a death-mobile car with rotating axes on the hood that drives by and chops off people&#039;s heads. [beheading is another common meaning].

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 23-5-2008(4): Seen before in &quot;Steadily&quot; and &quot;Temporarily&quot;. Both stories talked about taking an AXE to a CAR. Here, either take the horror movie approach where a driver in a CAR had his head CHOPPED OFF by a maniac with an AXE, or take the<strong> CHOP OFF</strong> shop approach where a guy is cutting up a CAR with an AXE.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 17-2-2007(3): In movies <em>cars</em> often have their tops <strong>chopped off</strong> as if with an <em>axe</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harpagornes">Harpagornes</a>] 3-11-2011(2): Lol: According to the dictionary this kanji means beheading, kill, murder.&quot; Conveniently the kunyomi just happens to be き.る. 語彙 : 斬る (き.る) to kill (a human) using a blade (sword, machete, knife, etc.); to slice (off); to lop (off); to cut (off) 斬に処される (ざん に しょ.される) to be sentenced to a beheading. Ref: <a href="http://www.jisho.org/kanji/details/">http://www.jisho.org/kanji/details/</a>斬.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiwiburner">kiwiburner</a>] 26-9-2012(1): To make a <em>car</em> into a covertible,<strong> chop off</strong> its roof with an <em>ax</em>. Classy.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hinsoog">Hinsoog</a>] 8-8-2012(1): Oh, so remember the time I had a giant battle <em>ax</em> lodged into my <em>car</em> making me <em>temporarily</em>(<a href="../1134">temporarily</a> (#1134 暫) reference) immobile for a few <em>days</em>? As it turns out it was just my friend trying to<strong> chop off</strong> the top of my car to make it into a convertible.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog">stupiddog</a>] 15-5-2011(1): Do you remember the car axe day from <a href="../1134">temporarily</a> (#1134 暫)? Well, it has finally come! Now, regarding that <em>car</em>, what is the first thing to <strong>chop off</strong> with my trusty <em>axe</em>?

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 10-6-2010(1): The chop shop CHOPPED OFF parts of my CAR.
