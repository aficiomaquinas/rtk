heisig: "&quot;To <b>lose</b>&quot; here takes the sense of &quot;misplace,&quot; not the sense of <i>defeat</i>, whose kanji we learned in frame 67. It pictures a <i>husband</i> with something falling from his side as he is walking along, something he <b>loses</b>."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rich_f">rich_f</a>] 19-7-2007(222): The <em>drop</em> falling here is the <em>husband&#039;s</em> toupee... he&#039;s already <strong>lost</strong> his hair once, now he&#039;s <strong>losing</strong> it again. Such is life, I suppose. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-8-2007(64): Note: Heisig&#039;s stroke order is wrong. It&#039;s the same as vermilion, drop first. <em>Homer</em> <strong>loses/drops</strong> his wedding ring.
