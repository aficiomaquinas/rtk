Don&#039;t really want to talk about it. - Let&#039;s just say the authorities thought it such a SLUM, that they placed AIEN EGGS there to try and wipe us out. Luckily I has a stash of SILVER that I managed to bribe the gate keeper with just in time. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Renaissance">Renaissance</a>] 18-11-2009(6): <em>Mister Burns</em> is actually not human. In his<strong> home town</strong>, everyone is born from <em>cocoons</em> made of <em>silver</em>.

They think back in fear to Shelob&#039;s <em>cocoon of silver</em> that once wrapped up Frodo in paralysis and the <em>city walls</em> that guarded Mordor. Frodo has his first instinct that he can&#039;t have his old life in his<strong> home town</strong> back after all.　　　  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/郷関">郷関</a>   / きょうかん : n 1）one&#039;s hometown   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/郷軍">郷軍</a>   / ごうぐん : n 1）veteran 2）reservist 3）ex-soldier.
