Keep in mind that in feudal societies there was no kind of money to speak of, so<strong> tax</strong>es were paid by serfs in <em>wheat</em> to the <em>devils</em> who came over to keep them poor. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku">genbaku</a>] 11-1-2008(98): This is an easy one.<strong> Tax</strong>es is like the devil taking away your hard earned wheat. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei">javiergakusei</a>] 22-7-2007(21): I don&#039;t know if it makes sense, but it works for me: If the Warrior cannot levy the shells [frame 378], then the Devil will come and colllect your Wheat as<strong> Tax</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pangolin">Pangolin</a>] 21-12-2008(9): When the church takes 10% of your <em>wheat</em> harvest, it&#039;s a tithe. When the <em>devil</em> takes it, it&#039;s a<strong> tax</strong>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 18-12-2007(9): &quot;Yes I&#039;m the<strong> tax</strong>man, If you take a walk I&#039;ll<strong> tax</strong> your feet, If try to eat I&#039;ll<strong> tax</strong> the wheat...taxman!!&quot; What a devil, that<strong> tax</strong>man is - If you don&#039;t get the reference listen to the song &quot;Taxman&quot; by The Beatles.
