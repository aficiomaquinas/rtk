## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/szreter">szreter</a>] 15-2-2008(283): <strong>Emotion</strong> is a <em>march of mouths</em> inside your <em>heart</em> telling you what to feel.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 17-7-2008(130): Strong<strong> EMOTION</strong>S don&#039;t stay hidden. They march right out of one&#039;s <em>heart</em> (below) and out <em>one</em>&#039;s <em>mouth</em> (shouted, snarled, or gently whispered - depending on exactly what kind of<strong> emotion</strong> it is!).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 19-5-2009(24): When you get<strong> emotion</strong>al, words come marching out of your mouth from your heart, and it&#039;s impossible to stop them.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 10-9-2007(17): Picture a site that consists solely of emoticons (represented by the mouth) marching across the screen - you know, hundreds of them. Imagine how much this website would slow down your computer. At this point you might consider stabbing the site&#039;s creator in the heart. (inspired by taijuando).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 24-3-2008(9): Emoticons held a <em>march</em> to protest against their low status in communication. Along went all those <em>little mouths</em>, shouting as <em>one</em>, riding not on horses but big squidgy <em>hearts</em>, bouncing one pace with each beat. Sadly, many were &#039;tired and<strong> EMOTION</strong>al&#039; (<em>euphemism for &#039;drunk&#039; in the British Press</em>) and they all started squabbling, at which point the march fell apart.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jaresty">jaresty</a>] 30-9-2007(9): A mouth march - each showing a different<strong> emotion</strong> (happy, sad, anxious, etc). The mouths are marching on top of a human heart. It is a commentary on how easily you can know the heart, by seeing its mouth.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 15-10-2008(7): Here we have the <em>Grim Reaper</em> (the <em>one</em> with the <em>scythe</em>, see <a href="../360">overgrown</a> (#360 茂) and <a href="../364">intimidate</a> (#364 威)). When he opens his <em>mouth</em> to speak, his words go right to your <em>heart</em> causing a great fearful<strong> emotion</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dizzwave">dizzwave</a>] 14-7-2008(7): The most<strong> emotion</strong> I&#039;ve seen in one place was at an anti-war protest in downtown San Francisco. A huge <em>march</em> of screaming <em>mouths</em>, lots of feeling pouring right out of their <em>hearts</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 23-12-2010(6): <strong>Emotion</strong>s are generated in the <em>heart</em>. Then they <em>march</em> right up and burst out of your <em>mouth</em>, usually in the form of you shouting something unfortunate. 感じる かんじる feel.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/killtheclock">killtheclock</a>] 5-2-2009(6): <strong>Gefühl</strong>e wollen nicht im Verborgenen bleiben, sie <em>marschieren</em> direkt aus dem <em>Herzen</em>, durch den <em>Mund</em> in&#039;s Freie. Man jauchzt, jubelt, heult oder schreit.
