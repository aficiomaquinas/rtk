## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 11-2-2008(260): (re: taijuando) When you are in New York City you have to be alert, i.e. in the &quot;New York <em>State of Mind</em>&quot;: you need <em>ten</em> <em>eyes</em> to make sure no one will go through your <em>garments</em> and pick your<strong> pocket</strong>s. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 26-3-2007(44): She had me in her<strong> pocket</strong>. It was a <em>state of mind</em> that would eventually <em>demolish</em> me... ---I use this story with a kind of unrequited love theme not only because it jives with my romantic soul, but also because this kanji also has connotations of attachment and sentiments/feelings. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 15-1-2008(39): <em>Data</em> is a good security officer because his <em>piercing eyes</em> can even scan <em>garments</em> for hidden<strong> pocket</strong>s. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 23-6-2007(36): Imagine Darth Vader&#039;s state of mind when he discovers his garment has not<strong> pocket</strong>s. &quot; D O NOT WANT!&quot;. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 25-2-2008(23): The tailor&#039;s state of mind when he eyed the needle and the simple garment:<strong> Pocket</strong>s! We must add<strong> pocket</strong>s! 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/testoman">testoman</a>] 29-5-2008(20): While Data&#039;s and Darth Vader&#039;s uniforms are very different they have one thing in common: neither has<strong> pocket</strong>s! 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 11-6-2008(18): <em>Data</em> keeps <em>ten</em> spare <em>eyes</em> in the <strong>pocket</strong> of his <em>garments</em>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 29-11-2009(15): Kanji have feelings too. If you swipe   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/土">土</a>   from   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/壊">壊</a>   <a href="../400">demolition</a> <span class="index">(#400 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/壊">壊</a>)</span>, this kanji will replace the missing primitive with a <strong>yearning</strong> <em>state of mind</em> - one meaning for this kanji. Yearning is a state of mind close to the heart, contained in a breast<strong> pocket</strong> perhaps. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Angrybeez">Angrybeez</a>] 8-7-2008(13): What&#039;s in my<strong> pocket</strong>? Gollums state of mind was frantic after ten riddles his twisted eye fell on Bilbos garments.... 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PenguinOnTheGreen">PenguinOnTheGreen</a>] 3-7-2008(12): This kanji also carries a meaning of nostalgia  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/、懐かしい">、懐かしい</a>  　なつかしい.
