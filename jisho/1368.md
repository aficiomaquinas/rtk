## Heisig story:

Top hat . . . father.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey">onsen_monkey</a>] 6-9-2006(257): Even though your FATHER is an old man, he can&#039;t give up his party lifestyle. Once a week he still dons his cool TOP HAT (well, it was cool 40 years ago) and goes out on the town to<strong> MINGLE</strong> with the ladies. This is a pretty common thing in Japan, where old motherfuckers still think they can pick up 19 year old girls.

What is <em>he</em> doing here, wearing his crusty old top hat? He starts to move over to where you are, and you feel the terror of potential parental embarrassment start to rise...
