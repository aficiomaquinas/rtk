## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 19-1-2006(195): You&#039;ve entered in a chinese shop where apparently the only<strong> item</strong> in sale is old, dusty, <em>hardened bamboo</em> (for construction for example). It looks like these<strong> item</strong>s have been there forever. Asking the clerk if anything else is available, he doesn&#039;t understand and instead asks - &quot;Two<strong> item</strong>s? Three<strong> item</strong>s?&quot; (the kanji is a counter for<strong> item</strong>s) - thinking you want to buy something. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 30-1-2008(96): Dragon Quest - You find a <em>hardened bamboo</em> stick, perfect for a weapon, but you can&#039;t pick it up because your<strong> item</strong>s are full. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 2-1-2008(23): When I checked the <strong>items</strong> on the shopping list my wife gave me, I did a double take when i saw <em>hardened bamboo</em>. What the hell kind of<strong> item</strong> is that and what could she want with it? 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtcamero">dtcamero</a>] 22-9-2010(18): When she saw my <em>BAMBOO HARDEN</em> we became an <strong>ITEM</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BooBooQ88">BooBooQ88</a>] 20-12-2009(9): Bamboo<strong> ITEM</strong>S will become hard and brittle over time. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thurd">thurd</a>] 27-8-2009(9): This <strong>item</strong> is made of <em>hardened bamboo</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog">stupiddog</a>] 30-12-2009(5): While playing an RPG, you suddenly get a <em>bamboo</em> <strong>item</strong>. What should you do with that? Turns out that is <em>hardens</em> every other <strong>item</strong> it touches, making everything stronger. Groovy! 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 17-1-2010(3): <em>Bamboo</em> is a tasty<strong> item</strong> but not once it <em>hardens</em> (<em>bamboo</em> element on top reminding us that it has now grown high and is therefore mature and hard). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 4-4-2007(3): <em>Bamboo</em> is very versatile. It can be made (<em>hardened</em>) into almost any<strong> item</strong>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lernsky">lernsky</a>] 18-2-2012(2): You check with a <em>bamboo</em> stick if something is <em>hard</em>. If so, it counts as an <strong>item</strong>.
