heisig: "<i>Each field</i> has its own <b>abbreviations</b> (chemistry, philosophy, sports, etc.). Needless to say, the &quot;stronger&quot; primitive - thatis to say, the simpler and more often used one - takes the dominant position on the left, even though the story would read them off the other way around."
