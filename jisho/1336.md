## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 16-5-2007(259): A <em>crown</em> was <em>bestowed</em> to the British royalty museum, but it was only a<strong> copy</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pm215">pm215</a>] 16-4-2008(84): True fact: in the UK the right to print a <strong>copy</strong> of the KJV Bible is <em>bestowed</em> by the <em>crown</em> -- there are only a few authorised bible printers. (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Bible#Copyright_status">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Bible#Copyright_status</a>).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narazumono">narazumono</a>] 8-12-2008(57): A <em>crown</em> is <em>bestowed</em> upon each Burger King patron, why not? It&#039;s just a cardboard<strong> copy</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu">ruisu</a>] 10-12-2007(22): I actually knew this one, until Heisig&#039;s keyword threw me off. Heheh. It&#039;s the very part of the very familiar kanji for <strong>photograph</strong>: 写真 （しゃーしん）, which is what I will let this kanji represent.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 13-10-2007(20): I think of the<strong> COPY</strong> of the CROWN that was BESTOWED upon David after he slew Goliath with ONE SLING.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 9-10-2008(12): The <em>crown</em> I was <em>bestowed</em> with was just a<strong> copy</strong>. Dammit!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eightyd">eightyd</a>] 17-1-2012(8): I will bestow a crown to whoever has a good story i can<strong> copy</strong> for this kanji.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raschaverak">Raschaverak</a>] 13-8-2009(8): Picture you are a museum robber and you want that fancy crown. But the museum was way ahead of you. Instead of costy surveillance systems they made a lot of copies (out of paper) of the original crown…and placed them in the same room (Picture a room full of these crowns, at least a hundred). Now you sneak in...but you can&#039;t enter the room until you are sure which to pick. So you pull out your slingshot and start firing the crowns one by one off their pedestals. At the very end only one remains! Halleluya!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 29-12-2008(5): 写真 （しゃしん）　－　can you<strong> copy</strong> this photo for me?

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 26-2-2009(4): Archimedes was able to discern that the <em>crown bestowed</em> to the king was only a<strong> copy</strong> made of cheap metals.
