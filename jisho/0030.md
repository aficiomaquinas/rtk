heisig: While we normally refer to the start of the day as "daybreak," Japanese commonly refers to it as the "opening up of night" into day. Hence the choice of this rather odd key word, <b>nightbreak</b>. The single stroke at the bottom represents the <i>floor</i> (have a peek again at frame 1) or the horizon over which the <i>sun</i> is poking its head
