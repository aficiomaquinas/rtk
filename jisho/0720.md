2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 28-6-2008(93): Four straight kanji here with   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/叔">叔</a>   in it, so let&#039;s make one story: Your UNCLE was full of <a href="../720">loneliness</a> <span class="index">(#720 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/寂">寂</a>)</span> (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/寂">寂</a>  ), and he lived by himself. He was naturally <a href="../721">graceful</a> <span class="index">(#721 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/淑">淑</a>)</span> (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/淑">淑</a>  ) in the water, and you knew he was once on the Olympic synchronized swimming team.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Beneus">Beneus</a>] 10-3-2008(28): This obviously refers to <em>uncle</em> Scrooge. Remember before he started to hang out with his nephews, he lived all alone in a huge <em>house</em>, old and broken because of the<strong> loneliness</strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 3-9-2007(19): Aww. I mean, you kinda gotta feel sorry for creepy <em>Uncle Herbert the Pervert</em>. When he goes to his house, which is nothing more than a <em>floating roof</em>, nobody else is there. It&#039;s so <em>small</em> there&#039;s only room for him and his <em>crotch</em>. What an image of<strong> LONELINESS</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 7-2-2007(14): This is the famous Japanese emotive word SABI. For a good image of SABI, here is a quote from the Haiku poet Basho (translated by Robert Haas): &quot;If a man goes to war wearing stout armor or to a party dressed up in gay clothes, and if this man happens to be an old man, there is something lonely about him. Sabi is something like that.&quot; Now just put your old <em>uncle</em> in the picture and imagine the<strong> loneliness</strong> he feels in the <em>house.</em>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inaka_rob">inaka_rob</a>] 17-4-2012(10): The unmarried <em>uncle</em>&#039;s <em>house</em> is the picture of<strong> loneliness</strong>. I know we are studying JAPANESE, but you might want to spell the key word correctly (gorgon さん）. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 21-7-2012(5): The epitomy of<strong> loneliness</strong>: an <em>uncle</em> in a <em>house</em> with no immediate family around. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(4): Uncle Junior is confined to his house (while on house arrest) feeling very lonely (while Tony Soprano is taking care of the “family”). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjidummy">kanjidummy</a>] 24-9-2010(3): <strong>Loneliness</strong> is epitomized by your single <em>uncle</em> living alone in his empty <em>house</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/libsrone">libsrone</a>] 6-5-2008(3): Loony spinster aunts don&#039;t get lonely in their houses because they&#039;ve got their million cats to keep them company. It&#039;s the uncles you&#039;ve gotta worry about.
