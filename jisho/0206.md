heisig: "To avoid confusing this frame with the last one, try to think of <b>savings</b> as actual money. The only difference is that our currency is not paper bills but <i>shells</i>, a not uncommon unit of exchange in older civilizations. The <i>nail</i> under the roof of the <i>house</i> points to a hiding place in the rafters on which one strings up one's <i>shells</i> for safekeeping."

## Heisig story:

To avoid confusing this frame with the last one, try to think of <b>savings</b> as actual money. The only difference is that our currency is not paper bills but <i>shells</i>, a not uncommon unit of exchange in older civilizations. The <i>nail</i> under the roof of the <i>house</i> points to a hiding place in the rafters on which one strings up one's <i>shells</i> for safekeeping.
