## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 4-9-2007(223): The person in charge of <em>running</em> the <em>parade</em><strong> surpass</strong>ed all our expectations (by just a extra drop...).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 7-1-2008(102): The <em>parade</em> of <em>runners</em> are all trying to<strong> SURPASS</strong> each other - and they end up running all the way to <em>Vietnam</em> (note that this kanji is also used for the country of Vietnam).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hoolan">hoolan</a>] 2-3-2009(36): A RUNNER will always<strong> SURPASS</strong> a PARADE.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 16-6-2008(32): This kanji is read the same way as # 385 &quot;transcend.&quot; The difference is that this kanji talks about<strong> surpass</strong>ing or crossing over a mountain (or the like) while 385 is used when<strong> surpass</strong>ing or transcending a amount of money, an expectation, etc. STORY: Some punk kids dared one of their friends to PASS/SURPASS the PARADE. So the kid got a RUNNING start but slipped on a DROP of something and landed face first in front of the PARADE ruining it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 6-3-2010(13): To make the marathon more challenging for the runners, they made them try to out-<a href="../384">run</a> (#384 走) a parade going down the same path. The runners must come out before the parade, and<strong> SURPASS</strong> it, to win a shopping spree at Mitsukoshi or a trip to Vietnam. Oddly, this is a kanji in Mitsukoshi Dept store ( 三越 ) and Vietnam ( 越 ).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 20-8-2006(12): The race was neck and neck until one runner was shot with a grappling <em>hook</em> which pulled him,<strong> surpass</strong>ing everyone else. As he crosses the finish line, a <em>parade</em> is held in his honor.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 5-10-2008(9): On the left: a <em>runner</em>, on the right: a <em>scythe</em> (see <a href="../360">overgrown</a> (#360 茂)) whose blade is bent out of shape. This means crossing over a mountain or a border, whereas <a href="../385">transcend</a> (#385 超) is to exceed something (as in superman 超人 , superconductivity 超電導 etc..) Story: the relay race (see <a href="../386">proceed</a> (#386 赴)) is now much harder: the runners carry a <em>scythe</em> as a baton, and they have to <strong>surpass</strong> a mountain ridge.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kilioopu">kilioopu</a>] 27-8-2009(7): I <strong>surpassed</strong> my expectations! While <em>running</em> the marathon, I was able to<strong> surpass</strong> the <em>parade</em> en route! I was so fast, they drafted after me. (Note that &quot;parade with hook&quot; is enclosed in <em>run</em>: the <em>parade</em> hooked onto and drafted off of the <em>runner</em>.).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nisshawn">Nisshawn</a>] 24-8-2009(7): The marathon RUNNERS<strong> SURPASS</strong>ED the entire PARADE without one DROP of sweat.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 21-7-2009(6): One man is trying to<strong> SURPASS</strong> his end by RUNNING away from the Battle Axe (鉞 = battle axe, i.e Scythe with a hook on it, the hook denoting the small fat blade of a battle axe).
