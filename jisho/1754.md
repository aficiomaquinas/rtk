## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laxxy">laxxy</a>] 3-10-2006(195): Press your ear to the gates and see if you can<strong> hear</strong> what is going on inside.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ambrokusa">ambrokusa</a>] 2-4-2007(50): To distinguish from listen, you<strong> hear</strong> someone at the door (gate).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 11-5-2008(34): At the GATES of Hell, along with the mouth that asks the impossible questions there is of course a giant EAR to<strong> HEAR</strong> the answers. The ear doesn&#039;t really listen as it knows they will always be wrong.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-9-2008(15): The genius tells me to put my <em>ear</em> up to the <em>gates</em> in order to<strong> hear</strong> the <em>lesbians</em> better (see <a href="../v4/1623">closed</a> (#1623 閉).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joxn_costello">joxn_costello</a>] 5-2-2009(9): Your ears are the gates that allow you to<strong> hear</strong>. NOTE: You <a href="../v4/1626">hear</a> (#1626 聞) with your <em>ear</em> alone, but to <a href="../v4/827">listen</a> (#827 聴) you need to engage your <em>heart</em> as well.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 26-10-2005(6): Hint : try to distinguish this one from &quot;listen&quot; by focusing on the passive aspect of<strong> hear</strong>ing, as opposed to the active listening. Here I have the <em>Sultan</em> who fits a big <em>ear</em> on the <em>gates</em> of his palace, so as to<strong> hear</strong> whatever happens outside of the walls of his palace. See &quot;<em>gates</em>&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/childofthetao">childofthetao</a>] 20-8-2011(4): <em>Ears</em> are <em>gates</em> to<strong> hear</strong>ing.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thairob">thairob</a>] 26-12-2007(4): BILL GATES is having trouble<strong> HEAR</strong>ING at his convention so he puts on his<strong> HEAR</strong>ing aid which is actually just a huge rubber EAR.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sick4paradise">sick4paradise</a>] 16-4-2010(3): In order to<strong> hear</strong> something, the sound has only to pass through the <em>gates </em>of your<em> ear</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/konakona50">konakona50</a>] 21-12-2008(3): Your ears are the gates that allow you to<strong> hear</strong>.
