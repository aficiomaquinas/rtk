## Heisig story:

This character rightly belongs to the previous lesson, but we held it until now because of the final element, the <i>tail feathers</i>. After the <i>drop</i> at the outset, the next three strokes are completely novel and should be given special attention.

## Premitive:

tail feathers So as not to confuse this primitive element with the character for feathers, think of the extravagant tail-feather plumage of the peacock. The form itself is too pictographic to need breaking down further. [5]

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 12-3-2008(392): In this kanji, you can see 3 katakana characters: ソ, ユ, and then ユ again followed by TAIL FEATHERS. STORY: &quot;So (ソ) you (ユ) wanna<strong> DO</strong> it?&quot; &quot;Only if you (ユ)<strong> do</strong>&quot; says the female bird as she raises her TAIL FEATHERS.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 12-10-2007(42): <strong>Do</strong> me <em>from</em> behind, says the bird, as she shakes her <em>tailfeathers</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alunalun">Alunalun</a>] 11-8-2009(20): Tell a story - a reluctant magician is asked to<strong> do</strong> a trick. The audience chant &#039;Do it,<strong> do</strong> it!&#039;, so eventually he<strong> do</strong>es one. He takes a <em>drop</em> of water (stroke 1), drops it on the ground where it runs<strong> do</strong>wn and smears out (stroke 2). It drops<strong> do</strong>wn two steps (strokes 3 and 4) (imagine some nice setting with steps), growing and becoming multicoloured, like a petrol drop, as it goes. Then at the bottom the magician touches it with his wand and you see it has turned into a set of peacock&#039;s <em>tail feathers</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavin.schultz-ohkubo">gavin.schultz-ohkubo</a>] 20-11-2010(12): The keyword &quot;do&quot; is just too generic for me, so I use &quot;<strong>for the sake of</strong>&quot;, which is perhaps a more common reading; for those familiar with the phrase ために, I believe this is the kanji for ため.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 18-1-2009(9): &quot;I <strong>do</strong>!&quot; says the bride before tripping over a <em>spear</em>, falling<strong> do</strong>wn the stairs and into the <em>flames</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 7-7-2007(7): [do; change; make; benefit; welfare; be of use; reach to; try; practice; cost; serve as; good; advantage; as a result of] 為 = ソ + <em>&quot;two steps stair&quot;</em> + <em>tail feathers</em>. My nephew is going to a costume party, dressed as an &quot;Native American Chief&quot;. He couldn&#039;t <strong>do</strong> the headdress by himself, <em>so</em> (ソ) I climbed my <em>two steps stair</em> to get the <em>tail feathers</em> (from a <em>Dodo</em>, of course) I have saved on the top of the wardrobe for something like this.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 7-9-2009(6): The 3 special strokes give us a diagonal line and a pictograph of two steps, so I look at it as: stairs. A redneck <strong>doo</strong>fus in the national park <em>drops</em> a <em>peacock</em><strong> do</strong>wn the stone <em>steps</em> as he attempts to take it home to eat and it lands on it&#039;s <em>tail feather</em> with a tortured squawk. &quot;<strong>Duuu</strong>de what are you<strong> do</strong>ing? Let&#039;s get out of here!&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rhclaghorn">rhclaghorn</a>] 25-10-2008(5): ソ, ユ, and then ユ + <em>tailfeathers</em> (thanks Romanrozhok). <em>ソ</em><strong> do</strong> <em>ユ</em> take this chicken to be your wife? I<strong> DO</strong> And<strong> do</strong> <em>ユ</em> take this rooster to be your husband? I<strong> DO</strong> Cock-a-doodle<strong> do</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KanjiVirtuoso">KanjiVirtuoso</a>] 2-12-2011(4): This reminds of the vulture scene from The Jungle Book. A vulture turns to another and says: &quot;So (ソ), what&#039;da you (ユ) wanna<strong> do</strong>?&quot;. The other replies: &quot;I dunno. What&#039;da you (ユ) wanna<strong> do</strong>?&quot; Now, imagine that discussion between <em>peacocks</em> [ad. romanrozhok].

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 16-10-2007(4): する！So to<strong> do</strong> something, you take the TAIL FEATHERS of a peacock (line w/4 bright<strong> do</strong>ts) and you then start the long task of climbing up the task, STEP BY STEP-- see it? Until all that is left is one little DROP of whatever you&#039;re<strong> do</strong>ing, and you can waggle around your TAIL FEATHERS with a peacock&#039;s pride.
