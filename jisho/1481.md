## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 20-1-2008(222): Distinguish from <a href="../501">formerly</a> <span class="index">(#501 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/曽">曽</a>)</span>. Think of<strong> previously</strong> as &quot;the previous customer&quot; in a restaurant. At a cheap sleazy diner, the <em>waitress</em> gives you unwashed <em>silver</em>ware that was<strong> previously</strong> used by the previous customer. Yuck. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 8-1-2008(78): For the waitress primitive, I don&#039;t really see the receipt. So instead, I imagine a waitress holding a plate above her head, using those legs to weave through the tables. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jotun">jotun</a>] 2-6-2008(31): <strong>Previously</strong> on The Silver Surfer. The Silver Surfer took the <em>Silver Waitress</em> back to his place. Now we get to see what happens next. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 14-1-2007(28): <strong>Previously</strong> -&gt; <strong>previews</strong> at the movies. Almost all the actresses on the <em>silver</em> screen<strong> previously</strong> were <em>waitresses</em>. Story by mspertus. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 20-6-2007(24): <strong>Previously</strong>, we left some <em>silver</em> on the table for the <em>waitress</em>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 22-3-2009(21):   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/既に">既に</a>  （すでに） is formal language for &#039;already&#039;. &#039;Already&#039; (or   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/既に">既に</a>  ) is a better keyword that works well with compounds too. Story: &#039;Have you rescued the <em>waitress</em> <em>Silver</em>surfer?&#039; &#039;<strong>Already</strong> done. I whisked her away while she was putting down the <em>silver</em>ware.&#039;. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vengeorgeb">vengeorgeb</a>] 24-4-2009(13): <strong>Previously</strong> on Lost. Kate works as a hooter waitress and collects the <em>silver</em> from the clients. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wonderflonium">wonderflonium</a>] 18-10-2009(10): <a href="Http://www.psfk.com/2009/10/ogori-cafe-service-with-a-surprise.html">Http://www.psfk.com/2009/10/ogori-cafe-service-with-a-surprise.html</a> - Go to this restaurant and the waitress will bring you silverware and the food that was ordered<strong> previously</strong>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pgp27">pgp27</a>] 2-8-2009(7): <strong>Previously</strong> I used to give SILVER to the WAITRESS now she wants gold ! 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/HydroKirby">HydroKirby</a>] 15-7-2012(6): This kanji and the 2 after it frustrate me so much, so I researched the Chinese etymology. 旡 is actually   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/欠">欠</a>  , <em>yawn/lack</em>, written backwards and therefore means <em>swallow</em>. So the origin of   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/既">既</a>   is a <em>meal</em> that was <em>swallowed</em>. Story: My plate <strong>previously</strong> had a <em>meal</em> on it, but I <em>swallowed</em> it all.
