## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 28-10-2006(355): This is another way of <em>fortune telling</em> -- throw<strong> sticky</strong> <em>rice</em> against the wall, and look for the message in whatever sticks.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aniseed">aniseed</a>] 22-8-2008(35): Despite Heisig&#039;s warnings against this form of thinking, this is one of those rare kanjis that makes a good pictogram. Think of<strong> sticky</strong> as in<strong> sticky</strong> mochi paste, which is traditionally made by dropping rice in a bucket and pounding it with a mallet. So, you have the rice on the left, and on the right you have the mallet poised over the bucket. Nuff said.
