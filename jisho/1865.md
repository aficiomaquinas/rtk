## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 26-4-2007(206): The big mouthed <em>diretor</em> is even picky about the <strong>parts of speech</strong> you use, shouting, &quot;More verbs! Less adjectives!&quot; and such all the time.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 4-12-2006(49): A Grammar is basically a <em>word director</em> that tells us what part of speech each word is.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fergal">fergal</a>] 11-10-2009(24): This kanji is the ending of lots of<strong> parts of speech</strong> like noun, verb, adverb: 名詞 , 動詞 , 動詞 . People are messing around with <strong>parts of speech</strong> all the time now. <em>Company directors</em> are the worst, making up new <em>words</em> by verbing nouns and nouning verbs. &quot;please action that&quot;, &quot;what is the take-home from that?&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 19-7-2009(9): This <em>director</em> speaks very fast. So fast that you can understand only <strong>parts of</strong> his <strong>speech</strong> (some of the <em>words</em>). To make it even more memorable, imagine that this <em>director</em> speaks in Japanese and you are his interpreter. All you can understand at your current level is only<strong> parts of speech</strong>. You think to yourself: &quot;Probably this word was a noun and that word was a verb, but what the hell is he speaking about?&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 4-1-2008(9): A lot of the keywords in this book are a little difficult to figure out because you don&#039;t know the actual part of speech. Imagine a new edition with a friendly, chubby little <em>Alfred Hitchcock</em> holding a sign up telling you exactly which part of speech each word is.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 13-8-2007(8): <em>socrates</em> is a film <em>director</em>...his movies typically have pretentious titles like &quot;<strong>parts of speech</strong>&quot; or &quot;Nouns, adjectives, and verbs&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 26-5-2010(4): A <strong>part of speech</strong> is basically a <em>word director</em> that tells us what the words do.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sskaggs">sskaggs</a>] 18-8-2011(3): <strong>Parts of speech</strong> act as <em>word</em> <em>director</em>s, giving it meaning and indicating its correct placement and usage in grammar.
