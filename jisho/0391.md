Take a brush and brush out the blueprints. 2. Get a visual image of the blueprints all rolled up like they usually are. The second step is easy, it&#039;s just the architecht stretching out the blueprints and showing it to his clients. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois">Francois</a>] 16-3-2008(95): A construction worker&#039;s classic morning. <em>Stretch, brush</em> his teeth, and then start to<strong> build</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 12-3-2009(10): To<strong> build</strong> something first you have to <em>write</em> the plan and then <em>stretch</em> it into reality. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 21-7-2008(8): A Legendary architectual tool, The <em>stretchy</em> <em>brush</em>. Anything you paint will be magically <strong>built</strong> for you when you wake up the next day.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wzafran">wzafran</a>] 20-7-2007(4): (Modified from CharleyGarrett:) Imagine a <em>brush</em> painting a blueprint on a piece of paper. An architect then puts his hands on the drawing, and <em>stretches</em> the ink until it comes out of the paper and takes the shape of a house. And that is how architects <strong>build</strong> houses, really.
