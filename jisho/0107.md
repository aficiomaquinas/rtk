heisig: "By now kanji like this one should &quot;look like&quot; something to you even though it is more of an &quot;ideogram&quot; than a &quot;pictograph.&quot; The large <i>mouth</i> on top and the <i>human legs</i> below almost jump off the page as a caricature of <b>elder brother</b>, the one with the big <i>mouth</i> (or if you prefer a kinder image, the one who &quot;has the say&quot; among all the children). As a primitive this character will take the meaning of TEENAGER, in accord with the familiar image of the big MOUTH and the gangling, clumsy LEGS. SIMPLE My elder brother was basically a mouth on legs when he was a teenager."
