## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 22-10-2006(280): A ninja must be able to<strong> endure</strong> the pain of clinging to a ceiling, motionless, for hours at a time, waiting for just the right moment to drop down and thrust the <em>blade</em> of his sword into the <em>hearts</em> of his enemies. By the way, this character is used in the compound 忍者 (<em>ninja</em>) which is why I choose to use <em>ninja</em> as its primitive meaning.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 17-3-2008(60): 忍び （しのび）Shinobi the 忍者 （にんじゃ）Ninja was able to <strong>endure</strong> the massacre of his family &amp; horrors of his training by placing the way of the <em>blade</em> above the way of the <em>heart</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 7-4-2009(54): To<strong> endure</strong> unrequited love is like living with a <em>blade</em> in your <em>heart</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 11-10-2005(39): Someone with a <em>razor blade</em> stuck in their <em>heart</em> has to<strong> endure</strong> the pain wherever they go and can tell no one about it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/WeTsTICK">WeTsTICK</a>] 15-6-2009(17): I doubt you can<strong> endure</strong> a blade in your heart for very long.
