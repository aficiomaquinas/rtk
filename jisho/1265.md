## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 6-12-2006(296): A <strong>gorge</strong> is where God has cut into a <em>mountain</em> with a pair of <em>scissors</em>. (synewave,6-10-2006) <a href="http://www.travelblog.org/Photos/197361.html">http://www.travelblog.org/Photos/197361.html</a>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 10-2-2007(29): A<strong> gorge</strong> is where God has cut into a <em>mountain</em> with a pair of <em>scissors</em>. Nice pic mspertus!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 1-1-2006(27): A kid cuts a<strong> gorge</strong> into a paper <em>mountain</em>, with a pair of <em>scissors</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shinyclef">shinyclef</a>] 26-5-2009(25): Etymology of right half = 夾 (Type 1 Phonetic) (be pressed between). Interesting? <a href="../1265">gorge</a> (#1265 峡) <a href="../1266">cramped</a> (#1266 狭) <a href="../1267">sandwiched</a> (#1267 挟). Very directly related to the meaning of these three kanji.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 24-7-2008(16): For the radical on the right, I suggest using <em>zipper</em> instead of <em>scissors</em> (chosen by Heisig merely because it slighty looks like one), as I found it made this batch a walk in the park. What&#039;s more humorous than the image of a <em>mountain</em> <strong>gorge</strong> that can be opened or closed at will with a <em>zipper</em>?

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 16-10-2008(11): <em>Edward Scissorhands</em> fashions a bush into a <em>minature Mt. Fuji</em>, but his hand slips and now Mt. Fuji has a<strong> gorge</strong> on one side. Of course, all the girls think that the most <strong>gorge</strong>ous thing on the screen is Johnny Depp.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penot">penot</a>] 29-11-2008(6): Mneumonic for SCISSORS primitive and its dominant on-yomi : Today(<strong>キョウ</strong>) scissors are a safer way to cut your <em>husband</em>&#039;s hair (<em>dashes</em> of hair pictographically drop down as you cut)//キョウ、 コウ xia2 협 (hyeob).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 13-2-2008(5): <em>Homer Simpson</em> had to jump across the split in the <em>mountain</em> that made up Springfield <strong>Gorge</strong>, remember? Of course, his painful plummet to the bottom meant he had to be extracted from the rocks and debris with <em>scissors</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 28-5-2013(2): To<strong> gorge</strong> himself on a <em>mountain</em> of doughnuts is <em>Homer Simpson</em> heaven. After<strong> gorge</strong>ing on this <em>mountain</em> though <em>Homer</em> has to cut his waistband with <em>scissors</em> to relieve the pressure. (<em>Homer Simpson carrying scissors</em> will be the primitive meaning for 夹).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiwiburner">kiwiburner</a>] 22-1-2013(2): The way the<strong> gorge</strong> cuts into a <em>mountain</em>, you&#039;d think it was done with a giant pair of <em>scissors</em>!
