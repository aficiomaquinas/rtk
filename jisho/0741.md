## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun">sutebun</a>] 18-10-2007(218): <strong>FROM</strong> a pictograph of a thumbs up. That&#039;s how it also gets the primitive meaning of fist.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 13-10-2005(86): Pictograph, see book. This kanji, as a chinese character, is in fact the origin for the hiragana possessive particle “no”. Try drawing this kanji fast, in a single stroke and you will end up with の .

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie">mhheie</a>] 6-3-2008(46): Think Charlton Heston: &quot;<strong>From</strong> my cold, dead fists&quot;. Speech given to the National Boxing Association, in response to stricter control on boxing gloves.
