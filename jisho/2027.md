heisig: "The element for <i>day</i> on the left is logical enough. Next to it we see <i>staples</i> being held in <i>mouth</i> (one stroke is doubled up), indicating working in one's hobby or handicrafts at home on one's <b>spare time</b>. The small <i>box</i> at the top right is facing backwards, or more properly &quot;inside out.&quot; Finally, we have the <i>crotch</i> at the bottom."

## Heisig story:

The element for <i>day</i> on the left is logical enough. Next to it we see <i>staples</i> being held in <i>mouth</i> (one stroke is doubled up), indicating working in one's hobby or handicrafts at home on one's <b>spare time</b>. The small <i>box</i> at the top right is facing backwards, or more properly &quot;inside out.&quot; Finally, we have the <i>crotch</i> at the bottom.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zareon">Zareon</a>] 5-4-2007(314): Some jackass-like people have way too much<strong> spare time</strong>. You can find video&#039;s of them all over the internet, if you like such things, you can watch it all <em>day</em>. You see them <em>stapling</em> their <em>mouths</em> shut, or throwing eachother <em>upside down in boxes</em> or kicking each other in the <em>crotch</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-2-2008(94): Tip: The complex right side of this kanji appears twice more in Heisig. He later names it &quot;hobby&quot;. REF: <a href="../2689">shrimp</a> (#2689 蝦), <a href="../2779">haze</a> (#2779 霞).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster">snallygaster</a>] 18-6-2008(48): I avoid using &quot;mouth&quot; here because it makes me mess up the stroke order. Instead I use a flag/staple combo. Hopefully you&#039;ve seen the Justin Timberlake &quot;dick in a box&quot; spoof. Someone has a lot of<strong> spare time</strong>, so he decides to spend the <em>day</em> making an especially elaborate dick in a box. There&#039;s a <em>flag</em> <em>stapled</em> to the box as decoration (like wrapping paper). He rigs it up so he can instantly flip the <em>box inside-out</em> to reveal his <em>crotch</em>. Well, it&#039;s a vivid image once you get it. He&#039;s my hero.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 17-9-2009(23): A pervert&#039;s <strong>hobby</strong> (see Katsuo): He turns <em>two boxes</em> upside-down (&quot;コ&quot;) and <em>staples</em> them together - that makes them look like a bench. Then he hides in it and waits until some girls come and sit down. What can he see? Of course their <em>crotches</em>! If he does that all <em>day</em> he won&#039;t have<strong> spare time</strong> for anything else.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inaka_rob">inaka_rob</a>] 17-4-2012(13): WARNING EXPLICIT!!! In my<strong> spare time</strong>, basically all DAY long, I STAPLE a few things to the wall. a picture of a woman&#039;s mouth and outward facing &quot;box&quot;. I think you know what I do with my crotch.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/happyjolteon">happyjolteon</a>] 27-10-2009(12): (+Hujis) In my<strong> spare time</strong> I like to sit cross-legged in the sun and staple together packets of cocoa (Katakana ko ko).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 31-3-2011(11): On <em>days</em> when I have<strong> spare time</strong>, I indulge myself in my <em>hobby</em>: I painstakingly assemble elaborate sexual diaoramas (featuring lots of <em>crotch</em>) out of nothing but <em>staples</em>. I enjoy drinking mugs of cocoa (ココ) while I do this. Hey, don&#039;t judge! 暇 (ひま) : free time, leisure, leave,<strong> spare time</strong>, farewell; 休暇 (きゅうか) : holiday, day off, furlough; 余暇 (よか) : leisure, leisure time,<strong> spare time</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 8-8-2010(8): 暇も無く , 暇がない <a href="../1882">spare time</a> (#1882 暇) カ, ひま, (いとま） ... Parts: 日 , 尸, 二 , コ, 又 ... 熟語 : ... Katsuo Tip extended: RHS appears twice more in Heisig. He later names it &quot;hobby&quot;, 蝦 <a href="../2689">shrimp</a> (#2689 蝦), 霞 <a href="../2779">haze</a> (#2779 霞). Also in the old version of 仮 <a href="../966">sham/provisional</a> (#966 仮), as 假, and an alt.version of 蝦 <a href="../2689">shrimp</a> (#2689 蝦) as 鰕. It also appears in two not in RTK rare kanji 鍜 and 遐. All read カ．.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 22-5-2009(8): In my<strong> spare time</strong> I like to sit in the sun, drink two cups of coco (Katakana ko ko), then rub my crotch with my walking stick.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mistamark">mistamark</a>] 22-1-2009(6): In his<strong> spare time</strong> during the <em>day</em>, he practices writing out <em>RO</em> (katakana &#039;ro&#039;) <em>KO</em> (katakana &#039;ko&#039;) and &#039;<em>F</em>&#039; &#039;<em>X</em>&#039;. I think he&#039;s getting ready for RTK [props: xingji].
