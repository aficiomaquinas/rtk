## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jamiemw">jamiemw</a>] 11-10-2007(246): Oh no <em>Spiderman</em> has some <em>migrating ducks</em> stuck in his web, he has to<strong> slacken</strong> it so they can get out.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 8-7-2007(35): [slacken; loosen; relax; lessen; be moderate; ease] The <em>thread</em> in this story is a cable line, something like a power or phone line. The <em>thread</em> was tense with all the <em>migrating ducks</em> perched on it, but got back to being <strong>slacken</strong>ed when the entire flock flew away. (darg_sama-modified,2-11-2005).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 15-6-2006(16): A flock of migrating ducks has been complaining that their leader is flying too fast. So they attach a thread to him, whenever they want him to<strong> slacken</strong> his pace they just give a tug on the thread.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimitha">jimitha</a>] 5-11-2009(13): <em>Spiderman</em> is flying a flock of <em>migrating ducks</em> as one would fly a kite, using his web lines as the <em>thread</em>. But he notices the ducks are pulling away hard, threatening to break the line. Then he remembers the advice of dear Aunt May, a noted kite freak: you&#039;ve gotta<strong> slacken</strong> it. Put some <strong>slack</strong> in it!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 8-10-2007(6): When <em>Daffy</em> and <em>Spiderman</em> go rock climbing, <em>Spidey</em><strong> slacken</strong>s the rope too much, so that when <em>Daffy</em> falls, he slams on the ground. &quot;Your desp-p-p-picable!&quot;, he yells.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sboegema">sboegema</a>] 25-2-2008(5): <strong>Slacken</strong> the thread noose around your duck&#039;s neck, or soon they&#039;ll be quackin.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 2-11-2005(5): The thread in this story is a cable line, something like a power or phone line. The line is forced to<strong> slacken</strong> when an entire flock of migrating ducks tries to perch on it simultaneously.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavin.schultz-ohkubo">gavin.schultz-ohkubo</a>] 23-11-2010(3): You&#039;re flying a kite, when suddenly the <em>thread</em> <strong>slackens</strong>. You look up; what the...? Damn <em>migrating ducks</em>!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Vasek+N">Vasek+N</a>] 27-10-2010(2): Long live pixar... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjoDEQqyTig">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjoDEQqyTig</a>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/agrant">agrant</a>] 2-9-2010(2): Don&#039;t ask me why this works but I just imagine <em>Spiderman</em> holding a flock of <em>ducks</em> by the neck.. but he&#039;s holding too tight! and he needs to<strong> slacken</strong> his grip. This is when <em>Spiderman</em> first started and didn&#039;t know his own strength.
