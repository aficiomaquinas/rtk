heisig: "<i>Old man</i> . . . <i>sun</i>. This key word looks to be difficult because of its proximity to <i>somebody</i>. In fact, it is a very common kanji that will cause you no difficulty at all. Its meaning should be seen as the human referent for the abstract noun &quot;something.&quot; As a primitive it means a puppet-on-a-string."

## Heisig story:

<i>Old man</i> . . . <i>sun</i>. This key word looks to be difficult because of its proximity to <i>somebody</i>. In fact, it is a very common kanji that will cause you no difficulty at all. Its meaning should be seen as the human referent for the abstract noun &quot;something.&quot;

## Premitive:

As a primitive it means a puppet-on-a-string.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shizuru">Shizuru</a>] 24-8-2007(196): I find the best way of memorizing this kanji is in conjunction with the Japanese compound for <strong>ninja</strong>: 忍者 -- i.e.<strong> someone</strong> who <strong>endures</strong> (see FRAME 597 for the kanji 忍 ). A 忍者 is not just a 身 (somebody), it&#039;s 者 who can 忍 great 拷 !

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 20-1-2007(72): Back in the <em>day</em>, the <em>old man</em> used to be<strong> someone</strong>. His name was in the papers and all that. I use CHUCKY from the movie Child&#039;s Play as my major alternate meaning for this primitive.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 25-11-2009(42): An <em>old man</em> is<strong> someone</strong> who has seen many <em>days</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 14-3-2007(32): The <em>old man</em> who desperately wanted a <em>son</em> (<em>sun</em>) was Gepetto. He just wanted<strong> someone</strong> to love. As a primitive, this character will mean <em>Pinocchio</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 12-9-2009(18): [aircawn] Back in the <em>day</em>, the <em>old man</em> used to be<strong> someone</strong>. He was famous for being the world&#039;s number one puppet manufacturer. (let the &quot;one&quot; be your way to differentiate this between the kanji for &#039;somebody&#039;).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 1-2-2008(14): This kanji is used to represent a person who does something, much like the suffix <strong>-er</strong> (puppeteer, performer, etc). When one has something to be done, the usual solution is to call<strong> someone</strong> to do it (let&#039;s say, a plumber). But as these persons are very solicited, they take a loooong time to attend your call. When the plumber arrives, he is an <em>old man</em>, just like your call (now <em>sayeth</em>).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36">laner36</a>] 30-9-2007(8): The old man just wanted<strong> someone</strong> to love. But he spent all his days with his love doll instead. Primitive meaning: love doll.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thelooseteeth">thelooseteeth</a>] 15-3-2009(7): An <em>old man</em> rises with the <em>sun</em> every day. His friends call him <strong>sunone</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Floatingweed5">Floatingweed5</a>] 8-10-2007(7): Developing Laner36&#039;s story:- The<strong> someone</strong> in this kanji is a very special replicant love doll, who has taken old man Tyrell many many days to perfect.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sir_sanuk">sir_sanuk</a>] 14-1-2011(6): The <em>old man</em> used to be<strong> someone</strong>, but now his best <em>day</em>s are under him.
