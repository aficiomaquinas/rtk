## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 13-5-2006(206): I imagined some kind of initiation rite in old China, where every young <em>man</em> has to show his<strong> courage</strong>. They then receive a <em>chopseal</em> which is a mark of their<strong> courage</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 28-1-2008(76): Re: fuaburisu - The initiation rite in question is actually a reverse elbow chop to the <em>brain</em>, and you receive the <em>chop seal</em> if you have the <em>power</em> to withstand it. This initial imagery helps me with the altered <em>chop seal</em> and vertical placement.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 6-6-2008(62): A <strong>MA</strong> （マ） raises a <strong>man</strong> to have<strong> courage</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 20-4-2010(39): After showing sufficient<strong> courage</strong>, the young <em>male</em> gets a マ marked on their forehead with a hanko, to show they are now a マン.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shinyclef">shinyclef</a>] 4-6-2009(18): <strong>Note:</strong> Interesting kanji. It&#039;s actually not マ + 男 , but rather, this is an abbreviated form of 甬 + 力 , which gives it more of a meaning of &#039;path of power&#039; or &#039;run through with power&#039; or something like that. But if you don&#039;t care about the real origins and formation, either way of thinking of it works ^-^. (Source: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/oj4jes">http://tinyurl.com/oj4jes</a> + <a href="http://tinyurl.com/rcmnss">http://tinyurl.com/rcmnss</a>). <strong>Story:</strong> To have<strong> courage</strong> is to <em>run through</em> (甬) with <em>power</em>. When that happens, a マ becomes a man ( 男 ). (Thx Captal).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/At0m5k">At0m5k</a>] 16-12-2008(15): I use mango (マンゴ) for the primitive on the top, just because it&#039;s unique, makes for some funny stories, and there&#039;s a マ in it (I don&#039;t have any clue as to why Heisig chose this as a variation on chop-seal). Here we see a test of manhood, a young <em>man</em> uses all of his<strong> courage</strong> to run through a <em>field</em> with all his <em>power</em>, while his friends lob rotting <em>mango</em>es high into the air at him.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Delina">Delina</a>] 6-8-2008(10): Families will choose characters of a boy&#039;s name carefully so that his <em>chop seal</em> will reflect such desirable characteristics as<strong> courage</strong>, <em>brains</em> and <em>power</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 12-1-2007(8): The so-called &quot;Red Badge of<strong> Courage</strong>&quot; is actually a chop-seal with the character 男 <a href="../v4/859">male/man</a> (#859 男), dipped in red ink. Are you worthy?

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KanjiVirtuoso">KanjiVirtuoso</a>] 13-8-2011(6): When Link becomes a <em>man</em>, he&#039;s blessed with the Triforce of<strong> Courage</strong>, a shining mark on his wrist that looks like it came from a supernatural <em>chop-seal</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(5): [For those wondering why Heisig chose the マ as the chop-seal, it&#039;s because it <em>is</em> the chop-seal. See <a href="../v4/1401">orders</a> (#1401 令) for a link to how the &quot;other&quot; chop-seal is actually written. Disregarding that, I&#039;m going with a &quot;ma&quot;.] Story: A <em>ma</em> raises a <em>man</em> to have <strong>courage</strong>.
