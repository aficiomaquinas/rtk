## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 14-9-2006(247): <strong>Bringing up</strong> your offspring means raising them from <em>infant</em> until they are <em>meat</em> ready to be harvested. What, cannibalism is in poor taste? Forget I ever brought it up. But <strong>bring up</strong> will forver be <em>infant meat</em> to me. I want my baby back baby back baby back ribs! 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 6-10-2008(163): I will<strong> bring up</strong> my <em>infants</em> to eat <em>meat</em>. I&#039;ll not endure any vegetarian children in my house! 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sprutnik">sprutnik</a>] 19-3-2009(85): <strong>Bringing up</strong> an <em>infant</em> requires <em>months</em> of hard work. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 4-10-2007(41): Bringing up an infant on the Moon is easier than it is on Earth. (month=lunar) Gravity is lower, so they&#039;re easier to carry and they don&#039;t get hurt if they fall down. Best of all, their little space suits keep all that poopy smell inside! 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 6-10-2007(19): Remember The Matrix ? There was a spectacular scene where you could see human <em>infants</em> brought up by the machines, as if they were vulgar <em>meat</em>, for the sole purpose of feeding from the human&#039;s biological energy. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/findus">findus</a>] 25-2-2008(12): I will try my best to<strong> bring up</strong> my <em>infant</em>, the <em>flesh</em> of my <em>flesh</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/OrangeNut">OrangeNut</a>] 16-1-2009(11): To<strong> bring up</strong> your <em>baby</em> to be big, strong men, have them eat <em>meat</em> like real men do! (It helps me to picture an insane military dad encouraging his infant son to eat the huge steak on his high chair tray.). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Izumo">Izumo</a>] 28-3-2010(5): I will<strong> BRING UP</strong> my <em>infants</em> to avoid <em>flesh</em>—veggie all the way! 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cricket">cricket</a>] 12-4-2008(5): I WANNA MY INFANT TO BE STRONG SO I WILL<strong> BRING UP</strong> IT AND FEED IT LOTS OF MEAT SO ITS FLESH IS SO STRONG! AAAAH! 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dansette">dansette</a>] 30-6-2009(4): Vegetarians<strong> BRING UP</strong> their INFANTS without MEAT.
