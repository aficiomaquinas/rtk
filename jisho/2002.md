heisig: The painting of a <i>deer</i> itself with its form and color is enough to fill the bill for an image of something <b>lovely</b>. But to give a bit of contrast, we see two <i>mediocre</i> drawings from a later age on two patches of <i>ceiling</i> above. Note that the drop in <i>mediocre</i> has been lengthened somewhat and the second stroke drawn down straight.
