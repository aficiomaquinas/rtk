heisig: "As everyone knows, <b>tea</b> is made from <b>tea</b> leaves. But the <b>tea</b> plant itself has its own <i>flowers</i>, which can be quite beautiful and add a special flavor to the <i>tea</i>, as the Chinese found out already over 4,598 years ago. With the image of a terrace of <i>flowering</i> <b>tea</b> bushes in mind, picture a number of brightly painted and very l-o-n-g <i>wooden poles</i> (Frame 207) placed here and there in their midst, with a tiny <i>umbrella</i> at the top to shade the delicate-tasting <b>tea</b> <i>flowers</i>."

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps">ceeeps</a>] 13-9-2007(92): When I drink <em>herbal</em><strong> tea</strong> I like to drink it under a <em>parasol</em>. If it&#039;s too hot I go &quot;ho, ho, ho !!&quot; (katakana ホ).
