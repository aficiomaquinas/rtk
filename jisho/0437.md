1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 22-10-2007(203): There is a <em>graveyard</em> outside my house that scares me, so I put a huge towel over the window to serve as a<strong> curtain</strong> so I can get a good nights sleep.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 17-7-2008(34): When a mobster says &quot;It&#039;s gonna be<strong> curtain</strong>s for you!&quot; He means you&#039;ll be wrapped in a towel, dead in a graveyard.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 19-6-2008(24): After Towelie died, instead of burying him in a grave, we hung him up as a<strong> curtain</strong> so the neighbours couldn&#039;t see us hitting the bong.

(Well, yes, it&#039;s technically a veil, but since Heisig doesn&#039;t use that as a keyword, think of it as a really big...um...<em>towel</em>.).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jsheetz">Jsheetz</a>] 31-5-2010(16): A towel hung under the graveyard entrance serves as a<strong> curtain</strong>, after all even the dead need their privacy.

The exterior of the house where somebody has died is adorned with black and white<strong> curtain</strong>s. A book of remembrance is opened and the family hold a wake with the body, as a Buddhist priest chants mantras to help the deceased spirit onward. All around and behind the open coffin are photographs and flowers of the deceased person&#039;s life, hanging like a great<strong> curtain</strong> behind the coffin.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 15-12-2009(6): I started using a <em>towel</em> as a<strong> curtain</strong> because I live next to a <em>graveyard</em> and I didn&#039;t want to look at it anymore.
