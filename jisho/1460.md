## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 17-6-2006(347): The athlete&#039;s <em>state of mind</em> is nothing but<strong> resentment</strong> after getting the <em>silver</em> medal. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 2-9-2007(73): <em>Data</em>&#039;s greatest <strong>resentment</strong> is getting a <em>silver</em> medal in Science Olympiad. (Image: <em>Data</em> fuming on the podium muttering about being half robot). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 2-5-2007(18): What is your state of mind when you win silver? You resent that you didn&#039;t win gold! 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 28-2-2009(8): <strong>Regret</strong> at missing the gold means a silver medalist&#039;s state of mind =<strong> resentment</strong> [True phenomenon: bronze medalists are happier than silver because they are just glad that they medalled at all.]. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 31-3-2008(5): Data felt<strong> resentment</strong> toward the Silver Surfer for being able to fly through space freely while he was always trapped on the Enterprise with Picard and Riker doing dumb missions. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tatiana">Tatiana</a>] 22-10-2006(5): <strong>Resentment</strong>? That&#039;s the <em>state of mind</em> Judas was in after accepting 30 <em>silver</em> coins from the Head Priest. He didn&#039;t do what he did for the money! 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/miyadamuraman">miyadamuraman</a>] 29-11-2011(3): Instead of the typical solid gold emblem and rank sigs given to officers in Starfleet, DATA only received SILVER ones. The reason? Starfleet Command felt that since he wasn&#039;t technically alive they should distinguish that difference by giving him SILVER sigs. Naturally, this created a lot of<strong> resentment</strong> on DATA&#039;s part. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johngwk">johngwk</a>] 29-4-2011(3): Regret-- Judas&#039; STATE OF MIND after betraying his Savior for 30 pieces of SILVER out of<strong> resentment</strong>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 17-12-2011(2): Queen Beryl&#039;s <em>state of mind</em> was always on the <em>Silver</em> crystal. She was full of both regret and<strong> resentment</strong> that she couldn&#039;t have it for herself.　　She&#039;d growl &quot;うらaaaaa” and her cold tin heart echoed like &quot;こん.”   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/痛恨">痛恨</a>   【つうこん】 (adj-no) regretful;. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/partyrash">partyrash</a>] 4-2-2008(2): When people reach their silver years they are often full of regret and<strong> resentment</strong> at all the opportunities they didn&#039;t seize upon when they were young. And people who receive silver in the Olympics are also often full of regret that they didn&#039;t put in that little extra effort.
