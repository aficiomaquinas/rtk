## Koohii stories:

Reason: See my note at <a href="../715">stalk</a> (#715 茎). Story: <em>Sigmund Freud</em> (= state of mind) has a mystery patient who has wrapped himself entirely in <em>toilet paper</em>. Freud is very<strong> suspicious</strong> that it&#039;s someone he knows (who wants to remain anonymous).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rachels">rachels</a>] 20-3-2011(14): Data keeps collecting more rolls of <em>toilet paper</em>. What does he need it for ? Very<strong> suspicious</strong> ! Who or what is he hiding in his room? Does this explain the dreadful state of his sheets also? see <a href="../715">stalk</a> (#715 茎) katsuo.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(8): Being <strong>suspicious</strong> is the <em>state of mind</em> you feel when you notice you&#039;re out of <em>toilet paper</em>. After all, you&#039;re the only one living here, so who could have taken the last sheets? It&#039;s a mystery.
