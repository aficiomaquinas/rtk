heisig: At the left we have the <i>needle</i>; at the right, the kanji for <i>specialty</i>, plus an extra <i>drop</i> at the top. Think of a <b>Dr.</b> who is a <i>specialist</i> with a <i>needle</i> (an acupuncturist) and let the <i>drop</i> at the top represent the period at the end of <b>Dr.</b> In principle we are trying to avoid this kind of device, which plays on abstract grammatical conventions; but I think you will agree, after you have had occasion to use the right side of this kanji in forming other kanji, that the exception is merited in this case.
