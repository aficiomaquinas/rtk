## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perfecturbo">perfecturbo</a>] 28-6-2006(308): On<strong> Vessels</strong> that travel long distances, sailors often get quite lonely. They keep TURKEYS on the<strong> VESSELS</strong>, but not for use as food. The lonely sailors take turns enjoying the turkey&#039;s CROTCH.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 23-12-2007(129): Donald Duck is a <em>big bird</em> that does <em>not wear pants</em>. It&#039;s good to use him as a mnemonic because he is a sailor, and this kanji is used to count<strong> vessels</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod">PacifistGod</a>] 30-1-2007(69): The turky&#039;s crotch is a vessel for the stuffing that you fill it with.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peterlasky">peterlasky</a>] 7-7-2009(35): The USS Turkeycrotch is a seaworthy vessel.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 15-8-2006(16): An ole&#039; pirate <em>turkey</em> sits <em>astride</em> the prow of a vessel (i.e. with his <em>crotch</em> on the prow). Recall from PAGE 211 the old turkey with pipe and monocle : now he takes off his monocle and uses a “field-glass” to count other<strong> vessels</strong> (pirate ships) on the horizon (this kanji is also a counter for ships).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 28-3-2009(12): Turkey, at the crotch of the Mediterranean sea, is where<strong> VESSELS</strong> pass into the black sea.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brainrobert1">brainrobert1</a>] 23-12-2010(7): Turkey + Crotch =<strong> vessels</strong> The navy<strong> vessels</strong> had odd names like HMS Turkey and HMS Crotch.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 18-6-2008(6): The<strong> vessels</strong> were so packed with <em>turkeys</em> there was barely enough room for everyone to <em>sit cross-legged</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 13-8-2007(6): In a moronic navy, TURKEYS were used as the mobile<strong> VESSELS</strong>, where they were ridden between the CROTCH to go about the water. Just picture someone stradling a turkey in the water.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnyo">Johnyo</a>] 2-6-2009(5): <em>Turkeys</em> can only fit in small<strong> vessels</strong> if they sit <em>cross legged</em>.
