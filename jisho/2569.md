6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wilsoncb">wilsoncb</a>] 24-8-2010(3): The girl was<strong> apprehensive</strong> about going home, having lost her precious hairpin in the paddy field. But then, it wasn&#039;t like she&#039;d lost both, just ONE...

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 20-7-2009(1): I ran out of Q-tips...then I noticed a <em>hairpin</em> lying on the counter that was about the same size as a Q-tip.

However, sometimes the <em>hair curler</em> will roll up and down the <em>brain stem</em>, which activates the medulla oblongata and makes people<strong> apprehensive</strong>. So this person has to be sure not to bounce around too much - or all of a sudden, for no reason, they&#039;ll get really<strong> apprehensive</strong> and suspicious of everyone.
