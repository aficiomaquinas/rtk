## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 30-6-2007(253): Your<strong> address</strong> should be displayed on your <em>house</em> and <em>mailbox</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 29-1-2008(139): For the primitive: This is a hi-tech Japanese <em>mailbox</em>, it automatically lights up in the <em>evening</em>, and has a biometric <em>fingerprint</em> scanner. --- Each <em>house</em>&#039;s<strong> address</strong>, even if it&#039;s hard to see in the <em>evening</em>, is like its own unique <em>fingerprint</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 6-6-2007(30): Mailbox - i never get my evening paper but the paperboy says he delivers it. so here i am dustin gfor fingerprints everyevening checking for his new prints . roof and mailbox. superman is the newpostamn so the local people write their<strong> address</strong>es on their rooftops as well as their mailboxes.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ghinzdra">ghinzdra</a>] 5-6-2008(21): Nowadays when you&#039;re asked your adress it has a double meaning : it&#039;s your HOUSE and your EMAIL BOX. N.B for the primitive mailbox : when you come back at home in the evening first thing you do is checking your mailbox and for that you need to give a fingerprint as your computer is locked.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 30-1-2008(12): When you send a letter you write the<strong> address</strong> of the <em>house</em> but it actually gets delivered to the <em>mailbox</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inaka_rob">inaka_rob</a>] 23-6-2011(5): For the primitive: This is a hi-tech Japanese <em>mailbox</em>, it automatically lights up in the <em>evening</em>, and has a biometric <em>fingerprint</em> scanner. --- Your<strong> address</strong> should be displayed on your house and mailbox. (best two stories together at last!!).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSleeve">TheSleeve</a>] 9-10-2007(5): *MAILBOX = EVENING + FINGERPRINT. In the EVENING some hooligans blow up your MAILBOX, but they are caught the next day because they accidentally left their FINGERPRINTS. You wondered why they targeted your specific HOUSE, but they eventually confess they had the wrong<strong> ADDRESS</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nefertyna">Nefertyna</a>] 11-10-2007(4): If people want to reach the MAILBOX of your HOUSE, they need to know your<strong> ADDRESS</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 12-6-2010(3): (NB: According to Henshall (p. 622), the bottom part of 宛 is a Chinese character in its own right meaning <em>TO TURN IN ONE&#039;S SLEEP</em>.) One of Kurosawa&#039;s movie&#039;s title is 悪い奴ほどよく眠る (わるいやっつほどよくねむる=<em>The bad sleep well</em>, or, literally, <em>To sleep as well as the bad guys</em>). If it is any indication, then 宛 must be showing the <strong>ADDRESS</strong> of <em>good</em> folk: a humble <em>ROOF</em> covering those who <em>TURN IN THEIR SLEEP</em> (because they actually have a conscience).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Odieone">Odieone</a>] 7-3-2009(3): My<strong> address</strong> lets the postman find my <em>house</em> and the <em>mailbox</em>.
