heisig: "<i>Slave</i> . . . <i>reclining</i> . . . <i>goods</i>. The key word suggests both <b>looking</b> ahead <b>to</b> something and &quot;seeing to&quot; what is at hand. Consistent with everything we have learned about the role of the key word, this means that you must choose ONE meaning and stick to it."
