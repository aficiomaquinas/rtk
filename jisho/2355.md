## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 31-3-2009(51): The keyword<strong> numb</strong> makes no sense. I choose   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/萎む">萎む</a>  （しぼむ）&quot;<strong>to fade away</strong>&quot;. A <em>girl</em> lies in a <em>wheat</em> field at the same time every day. A photo is taken every day showing this scene and a time lapse video shows the wheat growing through the year until the wheat is tall and the top sprouts to look like its <em>flowers</em>. At this point, the girl can no longer be seen in the photos and she <strong>fades away</strong>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 22-1-2009(35): Any FLOWER that will make you go<strong> NUMB</strong> is likely to be banned by the olympic COMMITTEE. No pain killers. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 18-6-2007(20): Oh, the <em>committee</em>&#039;s in for a surprise: I put some <em>nightshades</em> into their drinks. They&#039;ll be<strong> numb</strong> for sure, probably worse. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 18-11-2010(19): As the <em>flower committee</em> meeting went on and on, my mind went<strong> numb</strong> and everything <strong>faded away</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 27-4-2010(12): &quot;<strong>fade away</strong>&quot;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/萎む">萎む</a>  （しぼむ）seems a more suitable keyword. [thanks wrightak] To link both words:<strong> Numb</strong>ness is when &quot;sensations fade away&quot;. STORY: The <em>committee</em> meeting was so long and boring, some participants took an opium <em>flower</em> tisane allowing the proceedings to <strong>fade away</strong>, swopping boredom for<strong> numb</strong>ness. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BladeWalker">BladeWalker</a>] 12-7-2012(3): A <em>committee</em> meeting was called for one purpose: to stop <em>flowers</em> from <strong>fading away</strong>. Maybe if they<strong> numb</strong> the flowers? 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 16-12-2009(2): The hop <em>flowers</em> and <em>wheat</em> in beer <strong>numb</strong> one&#039;s inhibitions and allow them to talk to <em>women</em> more easily. Even better, if you have no luck with the ladies, keep drinking and all memories of the night will <strong>fade away</strong>! [thx bodhisamaya]. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/effer">effer</a>] 22-4-2012(1): His legs were<strong> numb</strong> from the car accident (paralysis?). The committee of caring wheat women brought flowers to his bedside. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethg">sethg</a>] 3-1-2012(1): As the <em>committee</em> members die off and fade away, <em>flowers</em> are collected to remember them. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hinode">Hinode</a>] 20-3-2011(1): The keyword &quot;<strong>wither</strong>&quot; is better for this kanji in my opinion. All things beautiful will die one day. <em>Flowers</em>, <em>wheat</em> and <em>women</em> all <strong>wither</strong> when they get old.
