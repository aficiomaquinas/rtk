## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 28-2-2007(175): This whole kanji is a picture of <strong>calm</strong>ness. The <em>wheat</em> has been harvested and even the <em>vultures</em> sit<strong> calm</strong>ly watching the humans <em>sweep</em> and clean-up after the harvest is over. <em>Hearts</em> are peaceful and<strong> calm</strong> at this time of the year. Even the days are<strong> calm</strong> without storm. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 29-10-2007(142): The farmer is<strong> calm</strong> knowing that his <em>wheat</em> fields are protected from <em>vultures</em> by his <em>strawman</em> with a <em>heart</em> (all the better to do the job properly). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stefanot">stefanot</a>] 14-4-2007(80): A<strong> Calm</strong> day: the <em>vulture</em> is flying above the <em>wheat</em> fields, where there&#039;s a a scarecrow made with a <em>broom</em> with an <em>heart</em> painted on the shirt (like oz scarecrow). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kusterdu">kusterdu</a>] 25-3-2008(42): The farmer lying in the middle of the wheat field is so<strong> calm</strong> the vultures think he is dead and keep trying to get at his heart. He just lightly brushes them away with a broom, barely noticing their presence. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 6-8-2008(35): Creepy but<strong> calm</strong> bucolic scene: In a field of wheat, a vulture sits atop a scarecrow&#039;s broom,<strong> calm</strong>ly eating a heart (a mouse heart?). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 26-5-2010(11): You&#039;ve gone to all sorts of efforts to keep your wheat safe from those darn vultures, now you see one and grab the nearest weapon – a broom – and lay in wait underneath the spot where you think it&#039;ll land. Readying your trusty broom, you feel your heart pumping. But you must keep<strong> calm</strong>... Lower your heartrate... Keep<strong> calm</strong>... ready... 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 10-3-2006(11): Farmer <em>Wheat</em> tried to<strong> calm</strong> his racing <em>heart</em> after chasing away a giant <em>eagle/vulture</em> with a <em>broom</em> . 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/etpan">etpan</a>] 28-11-2008(8): Kiki is flying on her <em>broom</em> once again but she&#039;s chased by a nasty <em>vulture</em>. She lands and hides in a <em>wheat</em> field. That was close ! Her <em>heart</em> is still pounding fast. Now she can<strong> calm</strong> down. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 29-1-2008(8): Wolverine is<strong> calm</strong> for once. He has a wheat in his mouth, like a cowboy, and uses a broom to sweep away the heart of the porch of the animal he just killed.

The<strong> calm</strong> of overwhelming power (at least within our borders).
