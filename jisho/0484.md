## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nyquil">nyquil</a>] 13-3-2007(195): In the dense cities of Japan even a small garden is a luxury. In this house, the owner has put <em>mirrors</em> on the<strong> boundary</strong> of his <em>land</em> so it feels much bigger. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brose">brose</a>] 16-12-2006(108): This is an old trick to keep out migrants. You put a bunch of dirty mirrors on the<strong> boundary</strong> of your land and theirs. When they approach the<strong> boundary</strong>, what they see in the mirror is their own land and someone that looks like themselves, only dirtier, so they figure your country isn&#039;t any better than their own and they head back home. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 25-1-2008(33): <strong>Boundaries</strong> and borders (another meaning of this kanji) used to be protected by daggers and swords (see <strong>environs</strong>, frame 284); but today our <em>lands</em> are protected by one-way <em>mirrors</em> at airport customs with video cameras and interrogation rooms behind them. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tstuhldreher">tstuhldreher</a>] 6-6-2008(20): In Japan, you often see MIRRORS at intersections. That&#039;s because the walls that form the<strong> boundary</strong> of people&#039;s LAND make it hard to see around corners. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rujiel">Rujiel</a>] 30-7-2009(19): Be aware the right-hand character 竟 really means &quot;endpoint&quot; or &quot;finally&quot;; it&#039;s commonly read &quot;つい&quot; (as in &quot;ついに&quot;) and usually written in kana alone. A<strong> boundary</strong> represents a country&#039;s <em>land</em>&#039;s <em>endpoint</em> (awkward phrasing for order) . 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zodiac">zodiac</a>] 5-11-2008(16): The<strong> boundary</strong> between life and death appears as a mirror in the soil. Don&#039;t step in it if you ever see it. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 29-10-2009(12): Alice slips through the<strong> boundary</strong> of her <em>land</em> through the <em>looking glass</em> (<em>mirror</em>). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/martinnz">martinnz</a>] 7-8-2009(11): In the cities of Japan many people really do have <em>mirrors</em> installed exactly at the<strong> boundary</strong> of their <em>land</em>, otherwise backing a car out onto a narrow busy street is next to impossible. Here&#039;s one: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42147828">http://www.flickr.com/photos/42147828</a>@N00/208835857/. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hoolan">hoolan</a>] 4-3-2009(6): The<strong> BOUNDARY</strong> was marked out with MIRRORS in the SOIL. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 5-6-2013(5): The<strong> boundary</strong> of his <em>land</em> was studded with <em>mirrors</em> as he believed that they deterred dogs and cats from shitting in his back yard.
