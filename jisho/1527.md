## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 2-9-2007(198): On the troical island of JOU, they<strong> brew</strong> <em>whiskey</em> while wearing <em>grass skirts</em> (top hats and scarves too). (Image: the strangely dresses islanders stirring a pot of<strong> brew</strong>. Careful <a href="../1430">fermentation</a> <span class="index">(#1430 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/酵">酵</a>)</span>). 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 26-12-2006(79): To me, the grass skirt is composed of six celery sticks and a scarf. Apparently you can<strong> brew</strong> whiskey out of grass skirts. No wonder it tastes horrible. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 11-1-2007(66): Note : up to frame 1530, the kanji share the same chinese reading (JOU), so don&#039;t hesitate to group them into the same environment. Here we have the &quot;brew&quot;-man, who<strong> brew</strong>s some kind of <em>whiskey</em> using palm tree leaves. Instead of collecting them himself, he just buys the <em>grass skirts</em> from the people on this tropical island where he lives (which you may name the JOU island, after the chinese reading). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 10-1-2008(27): <strong>Grass Skirt</strong> primitive: Picture some Hawaiian girls, wearing <strong>grass skirts</strong> and tropical <em>scarfs</em> (or leis), doing a dance. &quot;3, 4, 5, <em>6</em> pick up all the <em>celery</em> sticks!&quot;. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alantin">alantin</a>] 5-7-2008(22): This<strong> brew</strong> of whiskey will cause you wear grass skirts and dance around like a maniac! 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meredithcat">meredithcat</a>] 25-7-2010(12): A classic alcohol commercial: whiskey being<strong> brew</strong>ed while girls dance around, scantily clad in their grass skirts. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epsilondelta">epsilondelta</a>] 20-1-2010(9): Hint (thanks fuaburisu): You can abandon the &quot;grass skirt&quot; meaning altogether and simply use a fictional place called &quot;JOU Island&quot; (after the reading) for the right-side primitive (like we did earlier with &quot;The Pinnacle&quot;, 阝). To make the image more vivid, I imagine the inhabitants of &quot;JOU Island&quot; as primitive savages. Story: The best <em>whiskey</em> in the world is<strong> brew</strong>ed on <em>JOU Island</em>. (Now imagine the savages<strong> brew</strong>ing whiskey...). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 5-8-2010(7): Grass skirt... So Heisig has fetishes... 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 18-12-2009(7): I&#039;m mystified as to how <em>grass skirt</em> is formed from this primitive which is rare kanji meaning &quot;rise or assist&quot;. STORY: In a<strong> brew</strong>ery, <em>alcohol</em>   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/酉">酉</a>   bubbles, foams and <em>levitates</em>. [&quot;<em>Levitate</em>&quot; avoids confusion with <a href="../27">rising sun</a> <span class="index">(#27 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/旭">旭</a>)</span> or <a href="../43">rise up</a> <span class="index">(#43 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/昇">昇</a>)</span>, and here it brings to mind &quot;leaven&quot; i.e.yeast] <em>LEVITATE</em> primitive - A magician in <em>top hat and scarf</em> has a trick: An audience member writes down random number from 1~10 and the magician &quot;levitates&quot; the corresponding number of <em>celery sticks</em> - in this case <em>8</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 4-2-2008(7): **<em>WARNING</em>** LUDE STORY __READ AT YOUR OWN RISK__ (don&#039;t read past this sentence if you are under 18) &quot;Some girls… it smells like they are<strong> BREW</strong>ING WHISKEY in their (GRASS) SKIRTS&quot;.
