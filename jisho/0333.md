Unfortunately the<strong> pavilion</strong> was hastily constructed to meet deadlines. During the grand opening party of the racetrack, a <em>tall</em> servant walked into the<strong> pavilion</strong> hitting an edge of the<strong> pavilion</strong>&#039;s top. Although it was just an minor impact, the terribly constructed<strong> pavilion</strong> shook and showered <em>nails</em> down on the royal family. That was the end of it.
