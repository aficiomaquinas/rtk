## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 14-1-2007(243): It&#039;s the latest Japanese game show: <strong>Forudo</strong>! Contestants are given a sheet of paper and are told to<strong> fold</strong> it into a complex origami shape. If they&#039;re not done in 60 seconds, a huge axe descends from the ceiling and chops their work in half. Contestants know to recoil their hands from the falling axe, but some have been so absorbed in<strong> fold</strong>ing, they ignore the buzzer and get their fingers chopped off. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Piitaa">Piitaa</a>] 22-6-2006(89): <strong>Fold</strong> some origami into the shape of an axe with your fingers. It&#039;s even as sharp, so watch out for paper cuts! 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jotun">jotun</a>] 24-5-2008(45): To hold an <em>axe</em>, you need to<strong> fold</strong> your <em>fingers</em> around the handle. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tstuhldreher">tstuhldreher</a>] 12-10-2008(31): Japanese<strong> fold</strong> with their <em>fingers,</em> but the creases they make are as sharp as an <em>axe</em>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lanval">lanval</a>] 9-3-2009(9): I&#039; m so strong, I can<strong> fold</strong> the axe with my fingers (works well for me, just imagine it clearly). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 24-10-2005(9): An emperor in ancient China is very displeased with some origami that was given to him. He convokes the axe-man to &quot;<em>axe</em>&quot; the <em>fingers</em> off the person who dared<strong> fold</strong> paper in such a terrible way. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99">dshill99</a>] 6-9-2008(7): Use your <em>fingers</em> to<strong> fold</strong> your swiss army <em>axe</em> away. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 23-1-2008(6): Traditionally, Yakuza men that missed their <strong>chance</strong> to kill their objective would cut one of their <em>fingers</em> with a small <em>axe</em> (guillotine), and send it to their Honcho with a <strong>folded</strong> paper, in which they had written their excuses. (coincidentally, this kanji is also used when you break a bone). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 11-9-2007(4): [+akrodha] In this episode of the smash-hit Japanese game show <strong>Forudo</strong>, we see that Hard Gay is guest host! U......<strong>FOOOOORUDOOOO</strong>!, he shouts, and the contestants start <strong>folding</strong>. After 10 seconds, though, the <em>axe</em> unexpectedly falls and slices off the fingers of all contestants. Hard Gay removes his disguise to reveal the familiar visage of....<em>Fingers the Thief</em>! He swoops up all the fingers and dashes off to sell them on the black market, probably to <em>Shrek</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stshores24">stshores24</a>] 11-8-2008(3): Trying to do origami, but you keep getting it wrong and your <em>fingers</em> are tired from all the<strong> fold</strong>ing. Finally, out of exasperation, you get out your <em>axe</em> and chop the paper into tiny bits.
