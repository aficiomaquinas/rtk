4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Evangelo">Evangelo</a>] 20-8-2008(19): <em>Warning: This story is graphic.</em> In Rome, after the Third Servile War, the losing rebels were crucified (on T shaped crosses) and set <em>on fire</em> along the <em>road</em> back to Rome. These human<strong> lamp</strong>s lit up the massive <em>road</em> with burning corpses as a reminder not to lose against the Romans. Thanks Latin 3!

It also helps me imagining this in a pictographic manner... the fire being a man walking up to a<strong> lamp</strong> on a pole (the line represents the bottom of the &quot;lamp shade&quot; who&#039;s full image is out of view). His arm is reaching up to turn the<strong> lamp</strong> on. See what I mean?
