## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 29-3-2007(371): In Japan, a<strong> paulownia</strong> (きり）is known as the &quot;princess tree&quot;. It was once a traditional TREE planted at the SAME time as the birth of a daughter. It would grow fast enough that, at the time of her wedding, it could be used to make a dresser as a wedding present for her.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akira">akira</a>] 1-2-2007(98): <strong>Paulownia</strong> is a Japanese tree which looks same as any other tree.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zardoz73">zardoz73</a>] 8-2-2013(32): In the forest, there&#039;s a tree that my goofy friend PAUL claims he OWNS. I think he&#039;s nuts, because the tree looks the SAME as all the others.In Japan, a<strong> paulownia</strong> (きり）is known as the &quot;princess tree&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/totokan">totokan</a>] 6-11-2007(12): Also called Phoenix tree. After the wood is harvested the tree regenerates from its roots. The same tree comes up again.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gagge_tah">gagge_tah</a>] 13-8-2009(7): Paul owns the <em>same</em> <em>tree</em> as everyone else, a<strong> paulownia</strong>. // not every tree as in <a href="../460">plum</a> (#460 梅).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/doviende">doviende</a>] 22-10-2011(5): <strong>Paulownia</strong> is known in Japanese as kiri; it is also known as the &quot;princess tree&quot; (from the russian princess Pavlovna). It was once customary to plant a<strong> Paulownia</strong> tree when a baby girl was born, and then to make it into a dresser as a wedding present when she married. (from Wikipedia) So, each girl gets the <em>SAME</em> type of dresser when she grows up, from the <em>SAME</em> type of tree.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/undomiel">undomiel</a>] 8-4-2011(3): <strong>Paulownia</strong> trees are what monks like to rest against.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mtheory7">mtheory7</a>] 29-9-2009(3): <strong>Paulownia</strong> is the <em>same</em> <em>tree</em> named after the Princess Anna Pavlovna.
