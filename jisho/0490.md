## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Deonnn">Deonnn</a>] 9-12-2007(147): Note: The primitives are <em>top hat</em> and <em>bound up</em>. Compare <a href="../64">ten thousand</a> (#64 万). Story: A rich man wearing a <em>top hat</em> and <em>bound up</em> from head to toe hobbles up to you and asks for <strong>directions</strong> to the nearest police station because he just escaped from his kidnappers.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CSBarnes">CSBarnes</a>] 15-12-2008(49): I always keep my <strong>directions</strong> <em>bound</em> to the bottom of my <em>top hat</em> so I won&#039;t lose them.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 5-1-2007(15): To find the<strong> direction</strong>, the magician waved his <em>top hat</em> over his <em>dagger</em> to make it function as a makeshift magical compass.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ernest">ernest</a>] 18-9-2007(11): Is that a DAGGER under your HAT, of are you just happy to see me? Give me some<strong> DIRECTION</strong> here.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne">sethimayne</a>] 6-8-2009(9): I always have a <em>compass</em> <em>bound</em> underneath my <em>top hat</em>, so I know I&#039;m always headed in the right <em>direction</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fagie37">fagie37</a>] 6-1-2008(5): Oh my, what an unusual top hat. Not only does it do the usual magic tricks, there&#039;s also a dagger inside. AND it acts like Jack Sparrow&#039;s Compass, giving you a sense of<strong> direction</strong> to go towards exactly what you want.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 3-7-2006(4): Got a bit confused with the primatives on this one. So decided to use <em>bound up</em> instead of <em>dagger</em>. If someone in the know thinks this could cause me problems later, please let me know. Anyway my story is based on &#039;kasa jizou&#039;. This time the old dude is taking <em>bound up top hats</em> in the<strong> direction</strong> of the statues.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 1-1-2011(3): I tip my hat in the general<strong> direction</strong> of 10,000 yen.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kendobc">kendobc</a>] 12-5-2008(3): When I was studying with my tutor and I first saw this kanji a pimp popped into mind. This is a guy wearing a pimp hat (you know those big ones with the fur). And what do pimps do? They pimp out...&quot;hou&quot; (which is one of the readings of the kanji) showing them the &quot;way&quot; to go. I had to explain pimp to my tutor. That was a fun lesson. (=.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thehawkseye">thehawkseye</a>] 14-6-2012(2): [Monty Python] We have the holy dagger hat! Right! We shall consult the holy dagger hat which will tell us where the holy grail lies. So they pulled out the <em>hat</em> and spun the <em>dagger</em> as a compass to give them their<strong> direction</strong>.
