## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 19-4-2007(206): There once was a lonely little pig that constantly followed Spiderman, always nuzzling his leg and oinking tenderly. Spiderman finally caved in and decided to keep the little pig under one condition: the <em>pig</em> was to take a <em>broom</em> and sweep up all of <em>Spiderman&#039;s leftover threads</em> after having fought crime. The pig felt such<strong> affinity</strong> for Spiderman, he happily accepted—and did a good job too. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 8-2-2008(159): Spiderman has no<strong> affinity</strong> for a broom hence his house is a pig sty. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 23-10-2007(67): I hate doing this, since the Simpson&#039;s Movie was recent. But think of the<strong> AFFINITY</strong> Homer had with the PIG that was to be killed. The<strong> AFFINITY</strong> first had SPIDER PIG (Spiderpig, spiderpig, does whatever a spiderpig does). Then Homer dressed the PIG up with a BROOM and glasses making him Harry PORKER. Homer had more<strong> AFFINITY</strong> for that PIG than his family, hence hilarity ensues. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop">richcoop</a>] 5-8-2008(28): There is an<strong> affinity</strong> between the THREADS of a BROOM and a SOW&#039;s hair. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sindhikara">sindhikara</a>] 30-12-2008(19): Spiderman, though genuinely a good person, had an<strong> affinity</strong> for beating <em>pigs</em> with a <em>broom</em>. (I know it&#039;s random, but the mental picture is both vivid and hilarious). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 8-8-2008(19): <em>Spiderman</em> has an<strong> affinity</strong> for Spider<em>pig</em> since pig cleans up Spidey&#039;s place with a <em>broom</em> while Spidey&#039;s at work. He puts the broom on his head and sweeps. (Note the last stroke of broom and the first stroke of pig overlap. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/iVoid">iVoid</a>] 21-4-2008(18): (Based on Thora) Men who have an<strong> affinity</strong> for women who are handy with thread and a broom are typical male chauvinist pigs (mansgrisar). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thora">Thora</a>] 29-9-2007(13): Certain people have an<strong> affinity</strong> for romantic partners who are handy with <em>thread</em> and a <em>broom</em> - it is of no consequence if they look like <em>pig</em>s. hmm... 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pjhoover">pjhoover</a>] 29-8-2008(10): Charlotte&#039;s Web. a story about an<strong> affinity</strong> between a spider &amp; a pig. a common thread running through the story is Charlotte&#039;s bewitching (broom) the farmers to save the pig. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 31-3-2007(7): I think of processor<strong> affinity</strong> for <em>threads</em> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_affinity">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_affinity</a>). To keep your <em>threads</em> from turning into <em>pigs</em> and <em>hogging</em> all your system resources, processor<strong> affinity</strong> makes efficient use of your CPUs. The component in the upper right is not a broom, but a chart of <em>threads</em> effectively running in parallel due to good processor<strong> affinity</strong>.
