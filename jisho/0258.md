heisig: Take care to keep the meaning of this kanji distinct from that for <i>jewel</i>. Think of the most enormous <b>pearl</b> you have ever seen, a great <i>vermilion</i>-colored <i>ball</i> sitting on your ring and making it extremely difficult to move without falling over from the weight of the thing.
