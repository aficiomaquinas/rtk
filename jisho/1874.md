## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 13-3-2007(206): A boy floats his toy <em>boat</em> in a <em>gully</em> and imagines it as an immense <strong>ship</strong>.

How about this: the phrase &quot;shape up or<strong> ship</strong> out!&quot; This phrase originally meant that a soldier had better get his act together, or else face being<strong> ship</strong>ped off into a combat zone. Here we see a poor WW-I soldier who has been<strong> ship</strong>ped off to a combat zone. He&#039;s riding in the <em>boat</em> overseas to fight in the <em>trenches</em> (<em>gulley</em>).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster">snallygaster</a>] 27-5-2008(29): A<strong> ship</strong> is a <strong>boat</strong> so big, it makes a river look like a <strong>gully</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 22-6-2011(4): To keep this separate from boat, think of the word &quot;shipped out.&quot; When the navy guys are<strong> ship</strong>ped out, they lean over the boat and shout &quot;HARO!&quot; (ハロ) at the people on the receiving shore.
