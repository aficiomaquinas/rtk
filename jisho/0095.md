heisig: "The picture here is of a <b>street</b> sign on a long pole: Hollywood and Vine, if you please, or any <i>street</i> that immediately conjure sup the image of a <b>street</b> sign to you. Used as a primitive, we change the meaning of the key word and take the shape to signify a NAIL or a SPIKE. Should it happen, on reviewing, that you find the pictographs get jumbled, then think of jerking a STREET sign out of the ground and using it as a NAIL to repair your garage roof. SIMPLE STREET with a SIGN."
