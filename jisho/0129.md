heisig: "In primitive language, this character would read <i>stream</i> . . . <i>head</i>. And that turns out to be convenient for remembering its meaning of <b>obey</b>. Either one <b>obeys</b> the person who is <i>head</i> of an organization or else <b>obeys</b> by following the <i>stream</i> of opinion ("current" practice, we call it). Both these senses come together in this kanji."
