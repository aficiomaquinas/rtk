## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 2-4-2007(244): Two archeologists are in a <em>cave</em> looking at Chinese artifacts from various eras. One picks up a <em>rake</em> and says, &quot;What about this – T&#039;ang, do you think?&quot; The second puts the <em>rake</em> in his <em>mouth</em> and answers, &quot;Yes, it does <strong>tang</strong> a bit&quot;. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 17-12-2005(133): Screw it, this character refers to the drink. The powdery orange substance is actually found on the floor of tropical <em>caves</em>, where trained aboriginal peoples use wooden <em>rakes</em> to rake the Tang into a pile before putting a bit of it in their <em>mouths</em> to see if it&#039;s tasty or not. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 21-3-2008(94): (Based on matticus) The <strong>Tang</strong> juice was created in China in the <strong>T&#039;ANG</strong> dinasty. The T&#039;ANG emperor discovered that certain <strong>cave</strong>s walls had a very sweet smell, so he <strong>raked</strong> the walls of one of them and put the <strong>rake</strong> into his <strong>mouth</strong>. This way he discovered that tasty powder that nowadays is known as TANG juice. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zanzibar">zanzibar</a>] 31-5-2009(44): Archaeologists found an ancient RAKE from the T&#039;ang dynasty at the MOUTH of the CAVE. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 19-1-2008(14): I imagine that people from the T&#039;ang dinasty looked a bit like cartoony asians, with teeth so prominent that looked like <em>rakes</em> on their <em>mouth</em>. They felt ridiculous about that, so they usually hid on <em>caves</em>, wishing for a dinasty with better depictions. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wheezyheen">wheezyheen</a>] 13-6-2012(11): I can&#039;t believe nobody has said this yet - this is the から in   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/唐揚げ">唐揚げ</a>   karaage fried chicken! Story: It is little known that during the T&#039;ang dynasty, fried chicken was outlawed as a food. This kanji is a picture of the black-market fried chicken factory inside a dark cave where slaves stir the chicken in huge vats(mouth) of hot oil with big rakes. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shuusaku">shuusaku</a>] 25-8-2009(7): The remains of the T&#039;ANG dinasty are left under a CAVE. use a RAKE and shut your MOUTH if you want to find them. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KristinHolly">KristinHolly</a>] 7-9-2008(7): In the T&#039;ang dynasty, the riches of the Silk Road were <em>raked</em> into the <em>mouths</em> of the <em>caves</em> near Dunhuang. <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/chinacaves.html">http://www.crystalinks.com/chinacaves.html</a>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 20-2-2006(6): Archaeologists raking through T&#039;ang remains in a cave find something and their mouths open wide. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/coeli">coeli</a>] 20-4-2010(4): In der Tangdynastie lebten die Leute in Höhlen, die alle über dem Mund kleine als Rechen oder Besen geschnittene Bärte hatten.
