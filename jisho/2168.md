### On-Yomi: シン

## Heisig story:

<i>Woman</i> . . . <i>sign of the dragon</i>. The key word is a synonym for <i>pregnant</i>, whose character we met earlier (Frame 546). Although the two kanji are often used together, they should be kept distinct.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 5-9-2007(254): Any <em>woman</em> spending a night with the virile <em>Bruce Lee</em> is bound to end up<strong> with child</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 28-3-2008(54): BRUCE LEE&#039;S WOMAN was<strong> WITH CHILD</strong> and it really upset her stomach because little Brandon Lee was kicking ass from the inside.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 27-10-2007(24): A <em>woman</em> who is<strong> with child</strong> can&#039;t be sacrificed to the <em>dragon</em>; virgins only need apply.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 6-10-2008(11): <em>Bruce Lee</em> can make a <em>woman</em><strong> with child</strong> before they even know what happened.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 4-9-2008(10): The <em>woman</em> hides the dragon from poachers under her shirt, pretending she&#039;s<strong> with child</strong>. &quot;Seen any <em>sign of the dragon</em>?&quot; ask the poachers. &quot;Nope, haven&#039;t seen him,&quot; replies the woman.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch">NeoGlitch</a>] 3-11-2010(7): A <em>woman</em><strong> with child</strong> was marked with the <em>sign of the dragon</em>... and BAM!!, Bruce Lee was born! :D.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hunchbag">hunchbag</a>] 21-11-2009(6): Little known fact: <em>Bruce Lee</em> was a closet pedophile, so anytime he was &quot;<em>with woman</em>&quot; he was actually &quot;<strong>with child</strong>.&quot; (my apologies for disrespecting the dragon ;).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ivantolearnkanji">ivantolearnkanji</a>] 29-4-2008(5): Careful here ... Heisig has a typo in 5th ed. p400 - he has &quot;pregnant&quot; instead of the correct <a href="../v4/507">pregnancy</a> (#507 妊). Pregnancy is an abstract condition, i.e. &quot;During pregnancy you shouldn&#039;t smoke&quot;, while this kanji represents a more personalized version of the concept, i.e. &quot;Juno is<strong> with child</strong>.&quot; Which sounds like something Juno would say after being impregnated by the D&amp;D player.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lecz0r">lecz0r</a>] 5-9-2011(4): BRUCE LEE is so potent that any WOMAN who even brushes up against him will be<strong> WITH CHILD</strong> in no time.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 24-6-2009(3): A <em>woman</em><strong> with child</strong> hopes that her child will be born under <em>the sign of the dragon</em>, as these people tend to grow up to be powerful leaders.
