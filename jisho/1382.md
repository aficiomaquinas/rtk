9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/EKeiko">EKeiko</a>] 13-1-2013(3): Remember that scary torture<strong> MECHANISM</strong> in the Princess Bride? You enter through the TREE, and there you will see the evil prince choosing HOW MANY years of life the<strong> MECHANISM</strong> would suck away from poor Wesley...
