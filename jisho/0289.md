heisig: "On the left we see a <i>vehicle</i> used for <b>transport</b>. On the right, we see a new tangle of elements that need sorting out. The first three strokes, you will remember, are the primitive for <i>meeting</i>. Below it we see the elements for <i>flesh</i> and <i>saber</i>, which combine to create a compound element for a <i>butcher</i> and his trade. Together they give us the image of a &quot;trucker's convoy.&quot;"

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jmadsen">jmadsen</a>] 17-12-2005(219): The <em>car</em> is a cattle-car, used to<strong> transport</strong> animals for the <em>butcher</em>&#039;s <em>meeting</em> - a convention on new butchering techniques. Hear the screams of the animals as it pulls up in front of the convention hall, where the butchers are waiting with their knives out front.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pageturner1988">pageturner1988</a>] 18-9-2007(109): The vehicle<strong> transport</strong>s animals for a meeting with the butcher.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 3-8-2008(53): When <em>flesh</em> and <em>saber meet</em>... it&#039;s probably time to find some<strong> transport</strong> to the hospital. A <em>car</em> maybe?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wisher">Wisher</a>] 15-8-2008(32): In the movie Star Wars: A New Hope, Luke and Obi-Wan needed a<strong> Transport</strong> (VEHICLE) to get to Alderon. They had a (MEETING) with Han Solo. Things got rough in the cantina and an arm (FLESH) got cut off with a light saber (SWORD).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 27-8-2011(21): The difference between <a href="../289">transport</a> (#289 輸), <a href="../287">take along</a> (#287 連) and <a href="../303">carry</a> (#303 運)? <strong>Transport 輸 </strong>= when your car moves big items, like meat and sabers for that one butcher&#039;s hut. <strong>Take Along 連 </strong>= when you take a guest in your car on the road. <strong>Carry 運 </strong>= the luck you carry when the king&#039;s carriage is out on the road, tossing gold coins to bystanders.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 11-6-2008(17): This CAR is<strong> TRANSPORT</strong>ING MEAT and SABERS to the butchers MEETING.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/martinnz">martinnz</a>] 2-10-2009(11): I find it difficult to immediately think of butchers from the keyword<strong> transport</strong>. But if we breakup the word &#039;transport&#039; into <strong>trans</strong> and <strong>port</strong>. Then for me it brings to mind the problem of getting <strong>trans</strong> fatty acid (a meat byproduct) to the <strong>port</strong>. We know we will need some sort of a <em>car</em> to move it. But how to get the <strong>trans</strong> fatty acid out of the raw meat? Have a <em>meeting of butchers</em> to decide the best way.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harhol">harhol</a>] 30-8-2010(7): <strong>Transport</strong> secretary Geoff Hoon was caught having sex with RIHANNA (umbrella + one) in the back of his CAR. Under the light of the MOON he unleashed his FLESHY SABER, only for a News of the World reporter to sneak up under the cover of darkness and take a series of revealing snaps. Click click click!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FuDaWei">FuDaWei</a>] 25-5-2010(5): It was easy to<strong> TRANSPORT</strong> a <em>car</em>-load of <em>ninjas</em> to their <em>meeting</em>. They all hid in the trunk. [nb: I&#039;ve adopted <em>moon+saber</em> as NINJA (someone who wields a sword by the light of the moon), since BUTCHER is one of Heisig&#039;s lamest combos.].

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton">atomiton</a>] 5-4-2010(5): The big Oscar Meyer wiener truck<strong> transport</strong>. A <em>truck</em> fit to<strong> transport</strong> a <em>butcher</em> to the butcher convention SEE: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/kf72o">http://tinyurl.com/kf72o</a> and this kanji is yours forever!
