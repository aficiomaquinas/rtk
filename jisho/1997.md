## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 16-3-2007(245): A great Indian <strong>drama</strong> acted out every year is how a poor Bengali boy fended off the <em>tigers</em> from his <em>pigs</em> using only a <em>sabre</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 2-11-2007(48): If you thought &quot;The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; was full of<strong> drama</strong> then you&#039;ll love &quot;The <em>Tiger</em> the <em>Sow</em> and the <em>Sword</em>&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wingedge">wingedge</a>] 31-12-2007(36): A very sad<strong> drama</strong> about a little boy and his pigs. You see, a tiger showed up and ate up all his sows (his only source of income), and so the boy had to find the inner courage to go after the tiger with his dad&#039;s old rusty saber. Of course the boy dies, very tragic and all. It is a<strong> drama</strong> after all.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 23-5-2006(15): The friends of 100 Acre Wood decide to put on a play and decide it will be a<strong> DRAMA</strong>. TIGGER and PIGLET (SOW) will be the stars and engage in a SABRE duel.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 21-5-2008(10): Kermit the frog, in his new<strong> drama</strong>, &quot;Muppets in Bengal&quot;, defends Miss Piggy from a tiger using only a sabre.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 10-7-2009(7): There would be a lot of<strong> drama</strong> if a tiger tried to eat a sow but then the sow attacked it with a saber.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zaydana">zaydana</a>] 31-5-2009(5): In a<strong> drama</strong>, even the most ridiculous things can be treated as normal. For example, this kanji tells of the tale when a pig managed to find a saber inside the stomach of a tiger, and fight his way out of the tiger&#039;s stomach.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 17-8-2010(4): A bengali boy&#039;s pigs are eaten in a vicious tiger attack. The boy then goes on a quest to find the tiger that ate his pigs and cut them out of it&#039;s belly with his sabre. A<strong> drama</strong>tic confrontation ensues when the tiger reveals that he is the boy&#039;s long lost pet baby tiger from long ago. Will he kill his long lost pet to save his pigs? THE<strong> DRAMA</strong>!!!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 30-1-2007(4): The friends of 100 Acre Wood decide to put on a play and decide it will be a <strong>drama</strong>. <em>Tigger</em> and <em>piglet</em> (sow) will be the stars and engage in a <em>saber</em> duel. Problem is that the <em>saber</em> is so big that neigher <em>Tigger</em> nor little <em>piglet</em> can hold it up alone. The <strong>drama</strong> is lost to comedy.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bexinkyushu">bexinkyushu</a>] 31-8-2011(2): This is a famous Korean<strong> drama</strong> of ill-fated love: A tiger and a sow fell in love. However, the tiger was always at odds with himself - on the one hand in love, on the other trying not to eat his dear sow. He told the sow &quot;It&#039;s dangerous for you to be around me.&quot; The sow pleaded that she loved him too much. Things seemed blissful until, one day the tiger lost control of himself and ate the sow. He couldn&#039;t stand to go on without his love, and so he tragically stabbed himself to death with a saber.
