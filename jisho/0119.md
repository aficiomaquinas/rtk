heisig: "The word <b>resemblance</b> should suggest, among other things, a son's <b>resemblance</b> to his father. A &quot;chip off the old block&quot; is the way we often put it, but the character is more simple. It speaks of a <i>little</i> bit of <i>flesh</i>. When used as a primitive, the sense of RESEMBLANCE is replaced by that of SPARK or CANDLE. (If you want an explanation: the kanji for MOON also carries a secondary sense of FIRe, which we omitted because we are keeping that meaning for other primitives.) SIMPLE Little Chibi Moon has a RESEMBLANCE of Sailor Moon."
