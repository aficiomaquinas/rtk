## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(33): Beings <em>exit</em> the spirit world through the <em>altar</em> when you<strong> cast a spell</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 23-1-2009(7): SPOILER: The trophy in the Triwizard Tournament was just for <em>show</em>, in reality Barty Crouch Jr. had<strong> cast a spell</strong> on the trophy so it would be a Portkey that would make anyone who touched it <em>exit</em> the school grounds and teleport to the graveyard where Voldemort was waiting.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 6-4-2010(5): A spirit tried to <em>exit</em> the <em>altar</em> to our world, but I<strong> cast a spell</strong> on his unworldly ass and sent him back to whatever dimension it was he came from.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 14-5-2012(4): &quot;haunt&quot; or &quot;haunted&quot; seems a better keyword. (&quot;curse&quot; is already used.) Story: That place is so <strong>haunted</strong> there&#039;s an <em>exit</em> sign over the <em>altar</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 10-3-2010(1): The congregation sat in church, bored by the priest giving his sermon from the <em>altar</em>. A witch was hiding in the congregation, to appear as a normal human, but because everyone was bored she decided to<strong> cast a spell</strong>, whereby she made the <em>EXIT</em> sign above the <em>altar</em> flicker and change colour. (<em>Exit</em> signs are required in all churches now, for occupational health and safety reasons.).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 12-6-2008(1): Exit, evil altar: Before the devil being took the <em>exit</em> back to hell at the <em>evil altar</em>, he<strong> cast a spell</strong> at the crowd to bring them bad luck.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dharmapoa">dharmapoa</a>] 10-5-2013(): [tatari] maldição, assombração.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Haych">Haych</a>] 11-11-2012(): <strong>Cast a spell</strong> of exorcism to make the evil spirit <em>exit</em> from the person lying on the <em>altar</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/HolyKotor">HolyKotor</a>] 28-12-2011(): Most people don&#039;t know this, but a <em>cactus</em> makes a great voodoo doll. It&#039;s more powerful, and you need to place it on top of an evil <em>altar</em> for it to work, but being near the magic of the <em>altar</em> allows you to <strong>cast a spell</strong> on it to <strong>curse</strong> the person you despise (I imagine touching the <em>cactus</em> that&#039;s on top of the <em>altar</em> with glowing hands and hearing the inside of it turn to mush).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 31-3-2011(): So this witch tried to <strong>cast a spell</strong> on me. I made her <em>exit</em> the church quickly by bashing her head on the <em>altar</em> and tossing her butt out the door.
