heisig: When we refer to someone as <b>thick</b>-skinned or <b>thick-</b>headed, we are usually quick to add - even if only under our breath - something about their upbringing. Perhaps it is because deep down we cherish the belief that by nature people are basically tender and sensitive. Be that as it may, the Japanese character for <b>thick</b> depicts a <i>child</i> abandoned out on the wild <i>cliffs</i>, exposed to the heat of the <i>sun</i>, and thus doomed to develop a head and skin as <b>thick</b> as the parent who left it there.
