## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 7-7-2007(158): [game-hunting; shooting; game; bag] According to unicode.org and wwwjdic, 鼡 and 鼠 (<a href="../2065">mouse</a> (#2065 鼠)) are variants. So, for 鼡 (which I&#039;ll call <strong>rat</strong>) I have: an <em>owl</em>, flying in the <em>wind</em>, can easily spot a <strong>rat</strong> even if it&#039;s hiding in the <em>cornstalks</em>. Now 猟 is easy: <em>wild dogs</em> are having fun by <strong>game-hunting</strong> <em>rat</em>s.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 17-8-2007(129): The WILD DOGS are GAME HUNTING the OWL who flies like the WIND through the CORN STORKS.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shakkun">shakkun</a>] 1-7-2008(25): The hunter, with his WILD DOGs to sniff out prey and his trained OWL to scout from the sky, is out<strong> game-hunting</strong> among the CORNSTALKS in a fierce WIND.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mary_K">Mary_K</a>] 10-7-2010(12): A <em>pack of wild dogs</em> chases an <em>owl</em> gliding on the <em>wind</em>, who drops <em>cornstalks</em> on them. It&#039;s hard to tell who&#039;s doing the<strong> game-hunting</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 5-1-2007(11): The right side is also used in 蝋 , meaning &quot;wax&quot; (used in e.g. candle, 蝋燭 , and wax doll, 蝋人形 ). The lower right is 用 with wind instead of canopy. The true meaning of the right side is &quot;many gathering together&quot;, and meaning for 蝋 comes from bee nests (bee wax). So, right side: utilization of a multitude of owls in the wind ==&gt; multitude. Multitude of hunting dogs is used in<strong> game-hunting</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vengeorgeb">vengeorgeb</a>] 14-5-2009(8): New Duck Hunt: A <strong>game</strong> about <strong>hunting</strong>. Now there is a <em>pack of dogs</em> mocking at you when you miss a shot, other animals to hunt like <em>owls</em>, new variables to take into account like <em>wind</em> currents and finally optional modifier items like <em>corn stalks</em> to lure the birds.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 3-12-2009(6): When going<strong> game-hunting</strong> I take a <em>pack of wild dogs</em> to hunt down the game, and my pet <em>owl</em> who then drops a <em>cornstalk</em> overhead to show the <em>wind</em> strength/direction. I can then adjust my shot accordingly.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 22-8-2009(6): I tried to use a <em>pack of wild dogs</em> for<strong> game-hunting</strong>, but they had a hard time telling that some sound the <em>wind</em> makes does <em>not equal</em> there being an <em>owl</em> somewhere nearby. They kept going nuts for no reason.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joxn_costello">joxn_costello</a>] 7-2-2009(5): Here&#039;s a picture of two distinct methods of<strong> game-hunting</strong>: First, the human method, where you have a <em>pack of dogs</em> to help you flush and chase down your game. And second, Nature at her finest: an <em>owl</em> floating on the <em>wind</em> over the <em>cornstalks</em>, looking for the twitch of game below.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jotun">jotun</a>] 29-6-2008(3): A <em>pack of wild dogs</em> and an <em>owl</em> are playing a game, hunting(<strong>game-hunting</strong>)<em>cornstalks</em>. The owl wins of course, riding the <em>wind</em>.
