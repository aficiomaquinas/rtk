## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 29-3-2007(187): Start with a <em>circumference</em> and<strong> carve</strong> away until you get the <em>shape</em> you want.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 18-12-2006(74): [My primitive for <em>shape</em> is Mystique, the shape-shifter from X-Men.] <em>Mystique</em> the shape-shifter<strong> carve</strong>s obscure markings around the <em>circumfrence</em> of her blue body.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 20-7-2008(65): (Primitive: <em>shape</em> - when you were three you played with <em>Play-Doh</em>.) 彫 : Did anyone else use the <em>circumference</em> of the <em>Play-Doh</em> container to<strong> carve</strong> circular <em>shapes</em>?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 25-4-2010(38): HINT: There are a lot of good stories on this website using Bruce Lee as a primitive for <a href="../v4/2008">sign of the dragon</a> (#2008 辰), so you may want to avoid using him for shape. Mystique works well, as suggested by ayoung24.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Uncreativity">Uncreativity</a>] 28-1-2010(15): HINT: To help me remember that 彡 leans the opposite way as ミ, I am calling that primitive <em>my evil twin</em>. It&#039;s <em>mi</em> from the mirror universe. You can also think of it as the three strokes of my evil twin&#039;s goatee. STORY: I know the witness saw me<strong> carve</strong> the entire <em>circumference</em> of the victim&#039;s skin, but it wasn&#039;t me, officer; it was <em>my evil twin</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 5-2-2008(13): Some people invite <em>Bruce Lee</em> to a Thanksgiving dinner. <em>Bruce Lee</em> has the honor to<strong> carve</strong> the turkey. However <em>Bruce Lee</em> uses this opportunity to show off his martial arts skills. He whirls the knife with superhuman speed and, in a flash, makes a clean seam-like cut all the way around the <em>circumference</em> of the turkey&#039;s belly. The turkey&#039;s body, now sliced cleanly in half by the cut around its <em>circumference</em>, falls cleanly apart into two halves, spilling the stuffing onto the table.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thairob">thairob</a>] 8-1-2008(9): I&#039;ll use BRUCE LEE as a primitive for SHAPE because the 3 marks remind me of all the scratches he gets in Enter the Dragon. Also he was always in terrific shape. For this we see BRUCE LEE CARVING around the CIRCUMFERENCE of a log making the perfect nunchucks to kick some butt.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asayoru">Asayoru</a>] 5-11-2010(4): (I&#039;ll use <em>Kirby</em> as the primitive meaning of 彡.) &quot;What are you <strong>carving</strong>?&quot; &quot;What do you think?&quot; &quot;I dunno… a <em>circumference</em>… Wait, is that supposed to be <em>Kirby</em>?&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lowther">Lowther</a>] 22-4-2008(4): The artisan<strong> carve</strong>d beautiful shapes around the circumference of the sculpture.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 10-5-2006(4): If you are going to<strong> CARVE</strong> a bowl, you would first determine the desired CIRCUMFERENCE and then use your tools to<strong> CARVE</strong> a line into your piece of wood. Once you have your CIRCUMFERENCE set, you would then need to determine the SHAPE of your bowl, which will, depend somewhat upon the size of wood you’ll be CARVING.
