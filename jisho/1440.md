## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/happychair">happychair</a>] 14-3-2006(241): If I eat<strong> BEANS</strong>, after <em>ONE</em> <em>MOUTHful</em> I fart like some kind of <em>HORNED ANIMAL</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sindhikara">sindhikara</a>] 4-1-2009(91): I hate using primitives that are completely unrelated. Let&#039;s call this one Mr. Bean! He&#039;s an easy character to build stories with. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44">brian44</a>] 14-12-2007(32): Looks like a pot of refried<strong> beans</strong> on top of a stove to me with a top over the pot. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pangolin">Pangolin</a>] 3-3-2009(23): <em>One</em> <em>mouth</em>ful and you spit them on the <em>floor</em> (<em>two drops</em> of spit out<strong> beans</strong>). I&#039;m talking about   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/納豆">納豆</a>   (natto) of course. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 8-10-2007(13): <strong>BEANS</strong> are served on the TABLE. It&#039;s a simple pictograph, so force the issue here. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Seiska">Seiska</a>] 17-2-2011(6): Check out Mameshiba for this one, they are these small little<strong> beans</strong> that appear out of nowhere and offer random pit of trivia. Here&#039;s a typical scene from one of their funny videos: small mameshiba on the table with his horns opens up his mouth. (you might accidently learn how to spell the kanji as well: mame ・ mame-) <a href="http://dogatch.jp/mameshibaworld/">http://dogatch.jp/mameshibaworld/</a>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 20-12-2008(5): Those<strong> beans</strong> were so damn good, after ONE MOUTHful of &#039;em, I damn near flipped the table over. (The horns on a line is a flipped over table). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 11-6-2008(5): I see magic<strong> beans</strong> in a vase, they send the top hat away as they grow and reach the ceiling. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andresito">andresito</a>] 17-5-2009(3): A pot of<strong> beans</strong> with two strokes to keep the hot<strong> beans</strong> away from the surface. <strong>NEW primitive; Mr. Bean</strong> He&#039;s a cheapo and funny. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 1-9-2007(3): Bean,<strong> Beans</strong>, The Musical Fruit! This is a picto of the bean being pooted out, ricocheting off the ceiling. The horns-n-floor are the poot-lines.
