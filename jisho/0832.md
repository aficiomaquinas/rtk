## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 11-8-2008(287): Working in retail you learn the<strong> placement</strong> of any item should be at <em>eye</em> level so it&#039;s seen <em>straightaway</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimsublimeman">jimsublimeman</a>] 30-10-2007(188): On the JET Programme, many people have their <em>eye</em> on a<strong> placement</strong> in Tokyo, Osaka or another big city, and write it on their application form. They are usually sent to the countryside <em>straightaway</em>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 6-3-2007(53): To ensure the correct<strong> placement</strong> of anything, your turn your <em>eye</em> sideways and look <em>straightaway</em> to line it up. (Image: something specific your fixing correct<strong> placement</strong> for. Maybe trying to fit a fishhook through the eye of a neele...). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/strugglebunny">strugglebunny</a>] 4-1-2009(15): The<strong> placement</strong> of a cyclopes&#039; <em>eye</em> allows him to only look <em>straightaway</em>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 14-3-2011(10): At the job<strong> placement</strong> centre, you have to keep your <em>eye</em> ON the listings and apply <em>straightaway</em>, or you&#039;ll miss out on the chance of a lifetime.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/置く">置く</a>   おく put, keep, leave;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/位置">位置</a>   (いち) : location, position. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Axlen">Axlen</a>] 11-7-2010(9): Good product<strong> Placement</strong> catches the &#039;<em>eye</em>&#039; &#039;<em>straightway</em>&#039;. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/XIII_Vampire">XIII_Vampire</a>] 30-10-2006(9): The<strong> placement</strong> of an archer&#039;s arrow depends on how accurately his eye is trained down the straitaway to his target. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 11-9-2010(8): Like a carpenter&#039;s level, there are two eyes in this kanji -- one horizontal and one vertical. To ensure the correct<strong> placement</strong> of anything -- like pictures on a wall or <strong>placemats</strong> on a table -- your turn your <em>eye</em> sideways and look <em>straightaway</em> to line them up...   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/置く">置く</a>  [おく]  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/、お仕置き">、お仕置き</a>  [おしおき]  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/、位置づけ">、位置づけ</a>  [いちづけ]  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/、設置">、設置</a>  [せっち]. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 30-6-2009(7): Hint: That is not an eye, but a <em>NET</em> (radical 122).<strong> Placement</strong> of the <em>net</em> is very important. If done properly the game will be caught <em>straithaway</em>. Straight into the net!! Gotcha! 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 3-6-2013(5): <strong>Placement</strong> of any products a retailer really wants to push should be at <em>eye</em> <strong>level</strong> so they are seen <em>straightaway</em>. Think of the supermarket putting chocolate down at the <em>eye</em> level of little kids so <em>straightaway</em> they can start pestering mum and dad for it. (thanks icamonkey).
