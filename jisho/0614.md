## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 8-9-2007(409): Microsoft<strong> Outlook</strong> works about as well as a pegasus that can&#039;t see: they both crash all the time.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tummai">tummai</a>] 23-4-2008(100): I used to hate birds.They&#039;re loud, stupid and worst of all they shit on your head. Used to think birds were the most vile creatures on earth. Then I encountered a <em>pegasus</em>. I was just walking down the road, minding my own business when I happened to <em>look</em> up. I <em>saw</em> it there, braying noisily, ivory wings outstretched like an angel, back leg raised ever so slightly. It dropped a steaming brown load right on my face. It changed my<strong> outlook</strong> completely. Birds are the second most vile creatures on earth.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 14-10-2009(64): This kanji actually means <strong>view</strong>. While on a pegasus you will see a great <strong>view</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(64): You see a Pegasus flying far above, and wonder what your<strong> outlook</strong> on life would be if you could see what the Pegasus sees.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru">raseru</a>] 8-3-2008(34): You can see an amazing<strong> outlook</strong> when riding a pegasus.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rizzo">rizzo</a>] 3-11-2005(15): I discarded<strong> Outlook</strong>(tm) in favour of <em>Pegasus</em> as a method of <em>viewing</em> my email.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Phil2Musashi">Phil2Musashi</a>] 7-4-2009(12): Your<strong> outlook</strong> on life really changes after you&#039;ve seen a flying horse.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Talonmalon">Talonmalon</a>] 20-3-2012(9): A <em>pegasus</em> restored a person&#039;s sight and he was able to <em>see</em> again! Now that person has a positive<strong> outlook</strong> on life!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/futnuh">futnuh</a>] 17-10-2009(8): <strong>Outlook</strong> mail, written in C++, was preceded by Pegasus mail which was written in C.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the40pancakes">the40pancakes</a>] 3-4-2009(7): I remember playing Age of Mythology and using <em>pegasi</em> as scouts, their flying abilities coming in handy for <em>seeing</em> what was over the sea to give you a good<strong> outlook</strong> of the game.
