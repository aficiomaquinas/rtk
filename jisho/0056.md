heisig: "To remember the primitive elements that make up this kanji, an <i>eye</i> and <i>animal legs</i>, you might be tempted to think of it as a pictograph of a <b>shellfish</b> with its ridged shell at the top and two little <i>legs</i> sticking out of the bottom. But that might not help you recall later just how many ridges to put on the shell. Better to imagine a freakish <b>shellfish</b> with a single, gigantic <i>eye</i> roaming the beaches on its slender little <i>legs</i>, scaring the wits out of the sunbathers. When used as a primitive, in addition to SHELLS, the meanings OYSTER and CLAM will often come in handy. SIMPLE SHELLFISH looking like one big eye with legs."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe">stereovibe</a>] 16-1-2008(52): <em>Eye</em> thought I saw a<strong> shellfish</strong> <em>legging</em> it down the beach!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eugs51">eugs51</a>] 17-10-2007(36): Stare at the<strong> shellfish</strong>, it looks like an eye with legs.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Teango">Teango</a>] 6-3-2010(23): Remove the <em>eyes</em> and the <em>legs</em>, and a<strong> shellfish</strong> tastes great!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CarlKenner">CarlKenner</a>] 5-7-2007(14): The <strong>guy</strong> couldn&#039;t <strong>BUY</strong> any<strong> shellfish</strong> which had one giant <em>eye</em> and walked on <em>animal legs</em>, so he went out in his <strong>kay</strong>ak to catch some. (Kun readings are kai or gai, ON reading is BAI).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS">TerryS</a>] 21-11-2008(10): <strong>SHELLFISH</strong> look like big <em>eyes</em> with <em>legs</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/moomooacow">moomooacow</a>] 11-12-2009(8): Ah! A one-<em>eyed</em><strong> shellfish</strong>&#039;s running along the beach on its little <em>legs</em>, terrifying tourists.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bandwidthjunkie">bandwidthjunkie</a>] 29-11-2008(6): As a primitive this is very often best interpreted as &quot;Old Money,&quot; for example: bribe [80] (possessing old money), tribute [81] (the craft of making old money), rule [88] (old money was ruled by the sword), savings [194] (old money stored in the house and nailed under floorboards), failure [331] (to avoid failure in creating old money a hard taskmaster was needed)... The list goes on.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/odzio">odzio</a>] 8-11-2009(3): <strong>Shellfish</strong> (when its open a bit) looks like huge <em>eye</em> with little <em>legs</em> sticking out of it.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rakutenka">rakutenka</a>] 30-6-2007(3): With a single <em>eye</em>, I see <em>eight</em><strong> shellfish</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jeffmullins">jeffmullins</a>] 31-8-2011(2): An eye with legs is a<strong> shellfish</strong>.
