## Heisig story:

The <i>mouth</i> on the left is obvious. The rest is harder. Try this: <i>four St. Bernard dogs bound up</i> in a bunch. Together they should supply a clear enough portrait of a <b>yell</b>, provided you are careful to see all <i>four</i> of them. Note how the final stroke of the <i>four</i> is supplied by the long horizontal stroke of the <i>St .Bernard</i>.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 10-11-2005(223): Think yelp when you hear<strong> yell</strong> to help dinstinguish this from shout (1508). I think of the sounds that would come from the mouths of the 4 dogs if they were bound up together. I&#039;m imagining lots of yelping.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 7-9-2007(50): <strong>Yell</strong>? You mean, Old <strong>Yell</strong>er. Here, we see four <em>St Bernard dogs</em> all <strong>yell</strong>ing for a chance to play a part in Old <strong>Yell</strong>er. They&#039;re so loud that you have to <em>bound</em> them, and their <em>mouths</em>, up.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 14-12-2007(43): The musher<strong> yell</strong>s at the 4 dogs bound up to the dog sled to get them to run faster and cross the finish line first. (4 St Bernards bound up together makes a dog sled).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 26-1-2009(31): <strong>Note:</strong> 奐 means &quot;clear; bright.&quot; The keyword <a href="../v4/20">bright</a> (#20 明) is already used. However, among all the 3000 Kanjis presented by Heisig, the keyword <em>clear</em> alone is not used, so you might want to use it to refer to this radical. <strong>Story:</strong> Although I could not hear them, seeing their <em>mouth</em>es, it was <em>clear</em> to me that they are<strong> yell</strong>ing.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nac_est">nac_est</a>] 21-7-2007(18): You have to<strong> yell</strong> really hard if you want the <em>four St. Bernard dogs</em> to pull the sled: they don&#039;t like being <em>bound up</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattoc_g">mattoc_g</a>] 4-6-2009(14): Note: 奐 means &quot;clear; bright.&quot; The keyword bright (FRAME 20) is already used. However, among all the 3000 Kanjis presented by Heisig, the keyword clear alone is not used, so you might want to use it to refer to this radical.(props lifeflaw) You open your MOUTH to<strong> yell</strong> &quot;All CLEAR!&quot; ... you successfully BOUND UP the FOUR St Bernard guard dogs.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shinyclef">shinyclef</a>] 12-5-2009(7): A <em>mouth</em> that&#039;s <em>bound</em> by <em>four</em> <em>big</em> captors will<strong> yell</strong>! (I use &#039;big&#039;.).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lee101">lee101</a>] 27-8-2012(6): I LOVE YOU HEISIG.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jaunty">Jaunty</a>] 25-6-2009(6): I use 奐 (clear/bright) to mean a <em>dog sled team</em> as a primitive. You can imagine mushing them on a bright day, you&#039;ll need your goggles to cut down on the snow glare. Anyway, their <em>mouths</em> are all open yelping - basically dog<strong> yell</strong>ing.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Atomik">Atomik</a>] 12-1-2010(4): She<strong> yell</strong>ed so loudly, it was like <em>four big</em> voices <em>bound</em> up in one <em>mouth</em>.
