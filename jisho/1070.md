heisig: "The key word <b>shaku</b> has actually come into English in the word <i><b>shaku</b>hachi</i>, the ancient Japanese flute that measured &quot;one <b>shaku</b> and eight <i>sun</i>&quot; (the &quot;sun&quot; being about an inch in length). Since the <b>shaku</b> is about one foot in length, this makes about 20 inches. Let the final sweeping stroke be like a tape measure added to the <i>flag</i>."
