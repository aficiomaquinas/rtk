heisig: "This character, which looks a bit like a snowflake, is actually a pictograph of <b>water</b>&nbsp;- not any particular body of water or movement of water, but simply the generic name for <b>water</b>. Should you have any difficulty remembering it, simply think of a <i>walking stick</i> being dropped vertically into the <b>water</b>, sending <i>droplets</i> out in all four directions. Then all you need to learn is how to write it in proper order. As a primitive, this character can keep its form, or it can be written with three drops to the left of another primitive, like this: Y. This latter, as we will see, is far more common. SIMPLE looks like water"

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 8-11-2007(67): The kanji for<strong> water</strong> is an abstract primitive itself, so unless one is willing to break down its etymological development, it should just simply be memorized by strokes; constructing a story is not necessarily useful unless it strongly denotes its shape (I find that Heisig&#039;s story doesn&#039;t do this).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CandyCane">CandyCane</a>] 5-10-2008(54): For those having issues with this* &quot;A 7K foot pool of<strong> water</strong>&quot; Notice it looks like a 7, and a K. Might have to practice writing it a few times.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ozmos">Ozmos</a>] 10-9-2009(34): When you squeeze a stream you get<strong> water</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 24-7-2007(6): Dropping a hooked walking stick into the<strong> water</strong> causes a splash. (The primitive is often contracted to just two drops and a walking stick).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/foros">foros</a>] 7-3-2010(4): Dropping the <em>walking stick</em> into the<strong> water</strong> sent out <em>droplets</em> in 4 directions.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jaunty">Jaunty</a>] 12-8-2009(3): What do you get when you squeeze a river?<strong> Water</strong>, of course!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bellerofonte78">bellerofonte78</a>] 26-3-2009(3): 7K.
