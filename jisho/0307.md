## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 30-11-2007(149): Two little aliens in a trenchcoat and <em>top hat</em>, trying to look<strong> TALL</strong>. The bottom one, in the glass helmet, is under the coat. The top one has his top hat pulled down in disguise, so all you can see is his mouth. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 13-6-2008(82): Here we have TWO MOUTHS each wearing a different hat. The top one is wearing a TOP HAT which is know to be as a<strong> TALL</strong> hat. The bottom one is wearing a SPACE HELMET which is known as an EXPENSIVE hat. (this kanji means both). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton">atomiton</a>] 26-3-2010(34): Woody and Buzz-light year. Woody (in the cowboy <strong>hat</strong>) being<strong> Tall</strong>er than Buzz ( in the <strong>space helmet</strong>) both with big <em>mouths</em>. Thx Minlawc! (adjusted for clarity). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alunalun">Alunalun</a>] 14-5-2009(19): This is the classic two children trying to be<strong> tall</strong> enough to get on a fairground ride. The lower child hides under a <em>cover</em> while the upper child stands on his shoulders and talks like he&#039;s an adult. But they&#039;re still not<strong> tall</strong> enough! So the top child gets a <em>top hat</em> which j-u-s-t pokes above the &#039;you must be this<strong> tall</strong>&#039; line. (and they both have hungry <em>mouths</em> for eating candyfloss once the deception is complete). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yasser">Yasser</a>] 19-11-2008(12): A cowboy (here represented by a &quot;top hat&quot; revealing only his &quot;mouth&quot;) looks always<strong> tall</strong> against a ninja wrapped up in his &quot;hood&quot; that reveals only his &quot;mouth&quot;. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 7-10-2007(9): In his <em>top hat</em>, Abraham Lincoln was <strong>tall</strong>er than the alien from out <em>yonder</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dakoina">Dakoina</a>] 3-3-2010(6): 2 <em>mouth</em>s each wearing a different hat. The first one wears a<strong> tall</strong>, sombrero like <em>top hat</em>, the 2nd wears a <em>hood</em> (visualise those fluffy, kissy mouths from the coca cola ads a while back). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mafried">mafried</a>] 6-6-2010(5): In &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, Fesig and Inigo Montoya masqueraded as the Dread Pirate Roberts. You can see Inigo&#039;s <em>mouth</em> under the <em>cloak</em>, and Fesig wearing the <em>hat</em>. The dread pirate is very <strong>tall</strong>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shadow_sphinx">shadow_sphinx</a>] 27-9-2008(4): The dude with the TOP HAT standing up close looks<strong> TALL</strong>er than the dude over YONDER with the helmet. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zardoz73">zardoz73</a>] 14-2-2013(3): Two aliens: one wearing a tophat that&#039;s so big it covers his eyes and nose, so you only see the mouth, and the other with a helmet, also too big. Tophat is standing on the shoulders of Helmet, which makes them really<strong> tall</strong>.  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/高い">高い</a>   (たかい) :<strong> tall</strong>, high, expensive;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/高校">高校</a>   (こうこう) : high school.
