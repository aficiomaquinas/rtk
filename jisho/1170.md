## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 20-6-2006(180): You decide one day to paint a kanji on your ceiling. Unfortunately, you don’t have a brush, so, being innovative, you use a sprout. Knowing it could be messy, you search for a drop-cloth, but can’t find one. Instead, you put a shovel down on the floor to catch any drips resulting from the BRUSH-STROKEs.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 17-9-2007(77): To paint a kanji in your <em>ceiling</em> with only natural materials, you use a <em>sprout</em> as a <strong>brush</strong> and <em>shovel</em> some dirt to use as paint for your <strong>strokes</strong>. [modified from johnskb&#039;s].

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chully">chully</a>] 7-4-2009(46): Start with just <em>one</em> stroke. Soon more will <em>sprout</em>, and then you end up with a whole <em>shovel</em>full!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cingold">cingold</a>] 9-10-2009(37): The first kanji I learnt was just <em>one</em><strong> brush stroke</strong>, but then my knowledge <em>sprouted</em> and I knew a <em>shovel</em>ful.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 12-1-2008(28): New age artist. The canvas is on the <em>ceiling</em>. The floor is covered with bean <em>sprouts</em>. The artist takes a <em>shovel</em> and makes a sweeping motion on the ground, sending a stream of sprouts flying up to the ceiling and sticking to the canvas in strange patterns. &quot;This is radical calligraphy,&quot; he says, panting for breath, &quot;and the act of shoveling is my new-age equivalent of the classical<strong> brush stroke</strong>.&quot;.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 6-6-2012(16): NIGHTMARE! You can&#039;t remember the<strong> brush stroke</strong> order of the kanji although you have a neat kanji poster hanging over your bed. Your &quot;kanji-impotence&quot; follows you into your dreams: At night, &quot;kanji tentacles&quot; <em>SPROUT</em> out of the <em>CEILING</em> (kanji poster) and choke you. Then they drag you out of the house and start to <em>SHOVEL</em> a grave for you. They want to bury you alive! Luckily you wake up - and you only can here a silent whisper: Never forget the<strong> brush stroke</strong> order again...&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 4-1-2007(14): [brush-stroke; picture] You started with <em>one</em> kanji <strong>brush stroke</strong> (the kanji for <a href="../1">one</a> (#1 一)). But more and more <em>sprout</em>ed as you went along, and now you need a <em>shovel</em> to deal with all <em>sprouted</em> <strong>brush stroke</strong>s laying around...

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 22-6-2008(12): I just need 1<strong> brush stroke</strong> to paint a SPROUT in the SHOVEL.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Offshore">Offshore</a>] 23-9-2009(7): How the Japanese learn to write their kanji: Practice writing your<strong> brush stroke</strong>s whilst hanging upside-down from the <em>ceiling</em>, using a wet <em>sprout</em> as your brush. If you mess up 3 or more<strong> brush stroke</strong>s, your sensei will beat you senseless with a <em>shovel</em> until you get them right. Picture a classroom setting with a bunch of kids hanging from the ceiling, and the sensei pacing back and forth with a shovel in hand.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Deborah">Deborah</a>] 4-1-2008(7): On the <em>CEILING</em> of the Sistine Chapel the<strong> brush stroke</strong>s of Michelangelo are a marvel. Especially when you know he used a <em>SHOVEL</em> for the brush and <em>BRUSSEL SPROUTS</em> for pigment.
