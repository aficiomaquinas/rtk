## Heisig story:

Like the several abbreviations in Roman script to indicate &quot;and&quot; (+, &amp;, etc.), this short two-stroke kanji is used for the similar meaning of <b>or again</b>.

## Premitive:

As a primitive, it will mean crotch, as in the crotch of the arm. Or whatever.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sindhikara">sindhikara</a>] 1-8-2008(155): This keyword should really be &quot;again&quot; not &quot;or again&quot; Here is some context: think of the phrase &quot;Jya mata&quot; &quot; じゃ又 &quot; which is a farewell similar to &quot;then again&quot;. Also &quot;Mata ne&quot; &quot; 又ね &quot; and mata ashita (again tomorrow) &quot; 又明日 &quot;。 Note this kanji is rarely used, most of the time JP people spell it out &quot;mata&quot; except for in the last example: 又明日 .

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 16-4-2007(132): After her boyfriend&#039;s <em>crotch</em> has been satisfied, a woman might suggest they cuddle. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might say, &quot;<strong>Or again</strong>, we could fool around . . . &quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 26-9-2007(62): The crotch is the area of vital &quot;<strong>or again</strong>s&quot;. (Organs, that is.).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zenkun">zenkun</a>] 12-3-2006(23): As a primitive, instead of using &quot;crotch&quot;, I also often use &quot;sat cross-legged&quot; as this also looks like the kanji.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 9-1-2009(17): I agree with bodhisamaya and sindhikara, this kanji is more like just &quot;again&quot;. You can change this kanji to &quot;again&quot; if you change [ again FRAME 1815 ] to Re- , which is it&#039;s real meaning anyways. Also, beware of too many penis euphemisms. Associating crotch with penis is not too bad, but if you associate column, meat, gigantic, etc. with penises, you might find yourself confused as to which euphemism you meant.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 19-7-2008(15): For this one, use &quot;Hard Gay&quot; (the japanese comedian) <a href="http://www.samuraisoapbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/hard-gay.jpg">http://www.samuraisoapbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/hard-gay.jpg</a> , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaki_Sumitani">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaki_Sumitani</a> If you have problems associating this with HG, just imagine him replacing his well known &quot;Okay&quot; with an &quot;<strong>Or again</strong>, hooo!!!&quot;. If you want to use &quot;hand&quot; instead of &quot;crotch&quot;, you can still use Hard Gay, just watch some of his videos on Youtube and pay attention to the parts when he makes a gesture with his hands while saying &quot;セイ！&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 23-6-2010(11): Cross you legs,<strong> or again</strong> I&#039;ll see your <em>crotch</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 6-11-2010(8): &quot;Or again&quot;?! WTF?! What the hell kind of English is that? This keyword is pants. <strong>Or</strong> <em>then</em> <strong>again</strong>, crotch. 又は (または) : or, the other; 又 (また) : again, and.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cleber">cleber</a>] 7-6-2009(8): The <strong>crotch</strong> of her crossed legs is <strong>AGAIN</strong> visible! (Sharon Stone).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 10-4-2008(8): &quot;Or again&quot;??!?!? Sorry, but sometimes I think Dr. Heisig is insane. That&#039;s not even proper English!
