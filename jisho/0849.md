2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 27-5-2008(96): The<strong> venerable old man</strong> is using the <em>public restroom</em> in the park where he feeds the pigeons. But, alas, there is no toilet paper! So, he&#039;s caught a pigeon and is using it to wipe his bottom. (note the feathers on the bottom of the kanji, this helps remember placement). Can you see the <em>feathers</em> flying everywhere?

This old man has learned so much, he&#039;s literally cladded with feathers. But he&#039;s offering his knowledge to the <em>public</em>, answering questions from all citizens. Imagine them inquiring of him &quot;Oh<strong> venerable old man</strong>, please tell me..&quot;.
