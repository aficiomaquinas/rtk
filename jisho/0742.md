Castro just has to turn the<strong> valve</strong> on it, and USA is flooded. Suddenly, CIA agents tackle him from behind, grabbing both his arms. But <em>Castro</em> manages to open the<strong> valve</strong> with his <em>elbow</em>, by raising the <em>elbow</em> above his head. Success! USA is no more...

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 16-7-2008(12): Also means <strong>dialect</strong>. In some languages like Greek and Italian you use your two hands to communicate as much as you use your mouth. In some dialects, apparently, you also use your elbows...

The life-giving ichor flooded out, and Talos collapsed in a dead heap. Do not listen to those who say that the<strong> valve</strong> was on Talos&#039;s ankle. They are wrong. It was on his <em>elbow</em>.
