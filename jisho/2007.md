He caused the <em>water</em> to shoot up into the air and form the <em>sign of the tiger</em> in airborne droplets. You sure missed a great <strong>performance</strong>! 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 7-4-2007(51): I remember seeing advertisements growing up with the <em>sign of the tiger</em> saying to &quot;Put a tiger in your tank&quot;, meaning that it would increase the<strong> performance</strong> of the <em>drops</em> of gasoline you put in. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spoonsman">spoonsman</a>] 9-4-2009(30): At the end of Rocky&#039;s <strong>performances</strong>, set to the <em>Eye of the Tiger</em> of course, he was quite exhausted and dumped <em>water</em> all over himself to cool down.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 5-8-2008(26): You watch a tiger do a flip into a small pool of <em>water</em> at a circus. &quot;What a great<strong> performance</strong>!

He sets up a puddle of <em>water</em> on stage, stands across from <em>Hobbes</em>, and they carry out a beautiful<strong> performance</strong> of Robinson Crusoe, with <em>Hobbes</em> doing most of the actual storyline and acting (swimming about in the <em>water</em>, etc). Calvin finishes up and bows, but no clapping is heard - the whole<strong> performance</strong> was in his mind, and as far as the audience knows, <em>Hobbes</em> is just a doll sitting there, and Calvin was dashing it in the <em>water</em>...
