## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 20-12-2007(184): The villagers haven&#039;t the <strong>faint</strong>est idea that giant <em>coccoons</em> resting in the <em>mountain</em> are soon to hatch. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple">greenapple</a>] 24-5-2006(100): Frodo and Sam<strong> faint</strong>ed in the mountains and the spider wrapped them in cacoons. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/szreter">szreter</a>] 23-6-2008(72): Hint: this is<strong> faint</strong> as in dim, weak or indistinct, not the verb. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 5-11-2006(41): <strong>Two cocoons</strong> set out to climb a <strong>mountain</strong>, but they get separated. They shout to each other, but their voices, blocked by the mountain, are so <em>faint</em>. Notice that the first stroke of <strong>mountain</strong> is first, followed by the 2 <strong>cocoons</strong>, then the conclusion of <strong>mountain</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 21-1-2009(35): Two people wrapped in their sleeping bags like <em>cocoons</em> are <strong>seclude</strong>d in the <em>mountains</em> and can&#039;t hear the<strong> faint</strong>est sound. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 13-12-2009(30): IN <strong>secluded</strong> <em>mountain</em> ravines, firefly <em>cocoons</em> glow<strong> faint</strong>ly in the dark. HINT: I chose this story because kanji has sense of quiet and secluded, deep and remote or ghostly (faint).   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/幽霊">幽霊</a>   (ゆうれい) ghost. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snzzbk">snzzbk</a>] 7-2-2009(13): A picturesque <em>mountain</em> landscape; squinting, however, you can make out the<strong> faint</strong> outline of two throbbing alien <em>cocoons</em> among the peaks. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crayonmaster">crayonmaster</a>] 4-4-2009(10): I hated those Bugcatchers in the pokemon games. What were they thinking taking just TWO METAPODS up the MOUNTAIN path? Of course they will end up<strong> faint</strong>ing. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BooBooQ88">BooBooQ88</a>] 1-8-2009(9): All the Japanese people<strong> FAINT</strong>ED when they found out that there were 2 Mothra cocoons on the mountain. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 28-4-2007(6): A close pair of twin-brother caterpillars were separated during metamorphosis, and their <em>cocoons</em> were placed on <em>opposite sides of a mountain</em>. Will they be reunited one day, having <strong>faintly</strong> recognized each other? Or will their separation traumatize them so much that they <strong>seclude</strong> themselves forever?
