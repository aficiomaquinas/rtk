## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 9-4-2007(249): Some mothers use a <em>small broom</em> to<strong> hit</strong> their children when they misbehave.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 25-2-2007(53): [hit; right; appropriate; himself] If you&#039;re old enough, this is a pictograph of an Atari joystick (which, BTW, got its name from this word/kanji). You can also think of how an Atari joystick is like a <em>small</em> <em>broom</em> with which you can <strong>hit</strong> and sweep off the enemies from the screen...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 17-12-2005(52): Here is a weird carnival game where you hold a <em>broom</em> like a javelin and throw it, trying to<strong> hit</strong> the center of a very <em>small</em> target. The target is so <em>small</em>, in fact, that if someone does manage to<strong> hit</strong> it, the operator turns in surprise and says, &quot;Whoa, really?! ( 本当 ?!)&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball">Thunderball</a>] 6-11-2007(22): <strong>Hit</strong> the Atari ( 当たり ) joystick; it&#039;s a <em>small</em> hand-held <em>broom</em>- like device which you can use to<strong> hit</strong> and sweep off the enemies with. Tootal (とう) destruction! (Readings: あ(たり), とう).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sabretou">sabretou</a>] 14-2-2011(11): RPG: Your first weapon in the game is a <em>Small Broomstick</em>. Use &gt;&gt; Attack Enemy &gt;&gt; You<strong> Hit</strong> the Enemy for 40 Damage! (Imagine the two little sparks emerging from the broom as it<strong> hit</strong>s your enemy).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shuusaku">shuusaku</a>] 9-1-2013(9): <strong>HIT</strong> a LITTLE mouse with a LITTLE BROOM.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 7-7-2009(8): I&#039;d<strong> hit</strong> it (with my <em>little broom</em>stick)!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gotanda">gotanda</a>] 21-3-2011(5): Small brooms are a<strong> hit</strong> in Japan. Small is good here.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 25-11-2008(5): When I was <em>little</em>, my mother used to<strong> hit</strong> me with the <em>broom</em>... true story. Come to think of it, maybe I should write a book about my experience and call it &#039;Broken&#039; or &#039;Fragile&#039; or some other pity-provoking adjective. In fact, why even bother learning Japanese when I can make big money exploiting myself, and at the same time indirectly watering down the world of contemporary literature. On the other hand... nah.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SketchySolid">SketchySolid</a>] 23-1-2013(3): This kanji is a pictograph. The three <em>little</em> lines on the top show the force of the impact, as the <em>broom</em> <strong>hits</strong> the floor in a devastating downward strike. Imagine a scene from a manga, where some irate person has just savagely attacked something with a broom.
