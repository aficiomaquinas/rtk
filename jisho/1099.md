So it just lies in the back of the cave to<strong> rot</strong> as more work piles up.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 10-9-2006(12): The reason &quot;tofu&quot; contains this character is that it is curds from soy milk, and to &quot;curdle&quot; means to turn sour, which is one of the connotations of this character.
