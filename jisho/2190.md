## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jaresty">jaresty</a>] 4-12-2007(145): <em>Moreover</em> is a literary term to <em>shelve</em> what you had just been talking about, to come back to it later.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 15-1-2006(91): Same as darg_sama. Play on words. I imagine visiting someone who has an impressive collection of medals and trophies (chess champion, for example). After spending an hour showing you all the trophies in the <em>glass shelf</em>, you think &quot;Whew! It&#039;s over.&quot; ... but the person says &quot;... and wait, there&#039;s &quot;moreover&quot; !&quot;, pointing at more trophies lined atop the <em>glass shelf</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 30-12-2007(62): <em>Shelves</em> are useful for storing things, and<strong> moreover</strong> they are responsible for splattering the brains of monarchs on tatami mats.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boeso">Boeso</a>] 8-5-2008(22): I love Ikea SHELVES. &quot;MOREOVER here please!&quot; I shout to the assistant at the store so I can put all my new Japanese texts into them!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 18-3-2008(14): Imagine an impossibly pedantic rulekeeper (e.g. a judge, or a teacher, or a parent) who is lecturing you about everything you have done wrong. He stands before the <em>bookshelf</em> of rule books and starts at the bottom, pulling out a book. &quot;First of all, you did this wrong,&quot; he says, pointing at a rule in the first book. &quot;<strong>Moreover</strong>,&quot; he says, pulling out the next book, &quot;you also did this wrong.&quot;<strong> Moreover</strong>, and<strong> moreover</strong>, and<strong> moreover</strong>, he continues, pulling out each rulebook in turn and pointing out your errors.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 6-10-2008(8): A <em>shelf</em> lets you put<strong> moreover</strong> more.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 7-9-2009(7): You <strong>mor</strong>on, your room is so dusty.<strong> Moreover</strong>, there&#039;s <strong>more over</strong> on your <em>shelf</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 2-4-2008(5): Although similar to<strong> moreover</strong>, I like to use the simple conjunction &quot;and,&quot; such as, &quot; <a href="midori://search?text=彼は詩人であり、かつ小説家だ。">彼は詩人であり、かつ小説家だ。</a> &quot; &quot;He is a poet and novelist&quot; STORY: A real nerd: &quot;I like reading books AND making BOOK SHELFS&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 22-6-2006(5): Ties into shelf. There are more books over top of the shelf. Play on words.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andresito">andresito</a>] 23-5-2009(3): <strong>Moreover</strong>, the <em>Cat in the Hat</em> has more hats... and<strong> moreover</strong>...
