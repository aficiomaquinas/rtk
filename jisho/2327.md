heisig: "The sense of the key word here is the &quot;all-inclusive&quot; we find in terms like &quot;<b>Pan-</b>American Games.&quot; (It is also the character used in mathematics for &quot;partial&quot; as in partial differentials, in case you are a math major and want to take your story in that direction.) Instead of a <i>water</i> sports event that brings together the best talent, think of a meet of the region's most <i>mediocre</i> athletes, many of whom cannot even tread <i>water</i>. Now try to find a sponsor for the &quot;<b>Pan-</b><i>Mediocre</i> <i>Water</i> Sports Competition.&quot;"

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 23-1-2009(54): This is<strong> pan</strong>- as in the prefix meaning &quot;all&quot;. I think of<strong> Pan</strong>gea as being a mediocre continent with water covering the rest of the planet. This was before it broke up into the first-class, well-distributed continents we got now. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 17-6-2007(22): Yeah, all our <em>water</em> is fairly <em>mediocre</em>, but if we work together in some<strong> pan</strong>-continental union, we can make some better <em>water</em>! As if. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 9-6-2009(20): After<strong> Pan</strong>-Am crashed yet another plane into the <em>water</em>, their reputation dropped to <em>mediocre</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dancingblade">dancingblade</a>] 14-7-2010(6): A person sneezes. The <em>water drops in the wind</em> are about to start a<strong> pan</strong>demic and put the whole world in<strong> pan</strong>demonium. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 30-7-2010(5): <strong>Pan-</strong>Am was such a lousy airline, even the <em>water</em> in their in-flight meals was <em>mediocre</em>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snzzbk">snzzbk</a>] 18-9-2009(5): I went to a Hitchhiker&#039;s Guide to the Galaxy theme restaurant and ordered a <strong>pan-</strong>galactic gargleblaster, but what they gave me was just <em>water</em>ed-down, <em>mediocre</em> vodka. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alucardchuu">alucardchuu</a>] 3-1-2010(4): During a<strong> PAN</strong>demic disease, water quality is mediocre, better not drink it without boiling it first. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/salience">salience</a>] 19-5-2012(3): Peter<strong> Pan</strong> is pretty <em>mediocre</em> in the <em>water</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 9-12-2009(2): A worldwide <strong>pan</strong>demic of typhoid spread because global hygiene standards dropped, and everyone ended up drinking <em>water</em> of only <em>mediocre</em> purity. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andreki">andreki</a>] 2-2-2013(1): Peter<strong> Pan</strong> ist im <em>Wasser</em> nur <em>durchschnittlich</em>.
