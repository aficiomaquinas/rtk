heisig: The sense of the key word here is the "all-inclusive" we find in terms like "<b>Pan-</b>American Games." (It is also the character used in mathematics for "partial" as in partial differentials, in case you are a math major and want to take your story in that direction.) Instead of a <i>water</i> sports event that brings together the best talent, think of a meet of the region's most <i>mediocre</i> athletes, many of whom cannot even tread <i>water</i>. Now try to find a sponsor for the "<b>Pan-</b><i>Mediocre</i> <i>Water</i> Sports Competition."
