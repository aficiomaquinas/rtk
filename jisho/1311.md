## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 26-5-2007(229): <em>America</em> thinks it is the <em>pinnacle</em> of the world, looking down on all<strong> neighboring</strong> countries through its mirrored, aviator <em>sunglasses</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/desmidus">desmidus</a>] 30-3-2008(184): All the<strong> neighboring</strong> communities to the Pinnacle have a major problem. The kids at the Pinnacle have a habit of throwing down rice from the city walls in all directions, so people in<strong> neighboring</strong> communities are forced to wear sunglasses all the time in order to avoid getting rice in their eyes. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-2-2008(55): Tip: <em>rice</em> + <em>sunglasses</em> : In RTK3 Heisig names this combination &quot;<em>shoeshine</em>&quot;. It also appears in: <a href="../2051">sympathize with</a> <span class="index">(#2051 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/憐">憐</a>)</span>, <a href="../2052">phosphorus</a> <span class="index">(#2052 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/燐">燐</a>)</span>, <a href="../2053">camelopard</a> <span class="index">(#2053 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/麟">麟</a>)</span>, <a href="../2054">scaled</a> <span class="index">(#2054 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/鱗">鱗</a>)</span>. Story: You visit the <em>Acropolis</em> and are amazed to see the guy from your<strong> neighboring</strong> house back home working there as a <em>shoeshiner</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 23-4-2009(32): Tom Cruise (<em>American</em> with <em>sunglasses</em>) tried to get admitted to <em>The Pinnacle</em> but, with all the weird press, he was rejected and so now lives in a<strong> neighboring</strong> Scientology exclusive gated community. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 5-2-2007(19): <em>The Pinnacle</em>&#039;s<strong> neighboring</strong> mount is a place where they grow rice. They wear <em>sunglasses</em> since it&#039;s the sun&#039;s glare is so strong there. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 2-12-2006(9): The <strong>pinnacle</strong> rises above the <em>neighboring</em> hills. Only it is covered with snow, the color of <strong>rice</strong>. The sun reflects off of the <strong>rice</strong>-colored snow so brightly that we must wear <strong>sunglasses</strong> to avoid blindness. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Puchatek">Puchatek</a>] 2-2-2011(7): <em>The Pinnacle</em> is neighbouring with Totoro (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/隣のトトロ">隣のトトロ</a>  /となりのトトロ)! Only here he doesn&#039;t hide in the woods, instead he cultivates <em>rice</em>, always wearing cool <em>sunglasses</em> during work. Mind that he doesn&#039;t actually work in the field as such, instead he&#039;s just standing there looking cool and toying with his <em>sunglasses</em> while making sure that his underpaid employees cultivate the <em>rice</em> for him. Still, what a cool guy for <em>the Pinnacle</em> to be neighbouring with! 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eatyoda">eatyoda</a>] 29-10-2008(7): I threw <em>riceballs</em> at all my <strong>neighbors</strong> from my <em>pinnacle</em>, hiding my identity with <em>sunglasses</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lernsky">lernsky</a>] 16-12-2012(3): Crucifixions usually took place outside, but <strong>neighboring</strong> the <em>city walls</em>...
