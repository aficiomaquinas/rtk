## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 26-7-2007(279): The &quot;TOPIC&quot; of the day&#039;s newspaper must be placed JUST SO at the top of the PAGE to attract attention.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 28-8-2007(76): You spend ALL DAY, mending your socks JUST SO. Then you have a look at the HEADING of the newspaper. The<strong> topic</strong>---FREE SOCKS TO BE GIVEN AWAY!!!!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 7-1-2008(57): The<strong> TOPIC</strong> is written as the <em>heading</em> of the <em>page just so</em> readers know what the article is about.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yonosa">Yonosa</a>] 14-5-2009(27): This<strong> topic</strong> is just so boring turn the page...!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yenniku">Yenniku</a>] 3-7-2008(23): It <strong>JUST SO</strong> happens that girls giving <strong>HEAD</strong> seems to be the number 1 <strong>TOPIC</strong> of high school gossip.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 11-12-2008(20): <strong>Topic; subject.</strong> Combine <em>this</em> ( 是 - これ) with <em>page</em> ( 頁 ) and you have <em>this page</em>. A<strong> topic</strong> or subject is information on <em>this page</em> (i.e. the current page). Think of the page figuratively as any sort of information - it does not have to be a page - it could be what you are thinking about or discussing. If the <em>sun</em> is shining, you can read the <em>page</em> <em>correctly</em> and understand the<strong> topic</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/findus">findus</a>] 19-11-2007(14): &quot;<em>Just so</em> you know, the<strong> topic</strong> is written on this <em>page</em>&quot; (said the boss to the sleeping employee at the weekly meeting.).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aspr8045">aspr8045</a>] 4-3-2009(11): <strong>Topic</strong> = just so + head. When trying to think of an essay<strong> topic</strong>, I agonise over it. It has to sound JUST SO in my HEAD before I&#039;ll even start...

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nadavu">Nadavu</a>] 8-12-2011(7): Japanese is a<strong> topic</strong>-prominent language, but the<strong> topic</strong> is often omitted. Usually the<strong> topic</strong> is only brought up when there&#039;s a chance for misunderstandings, so it&#039;s like saying &quot;<em>just so</em> you know, I&#039;m talking about this or that&quot;. in other words, the<strong> topic</strong> is used to make sure everyone are on the same <em>page</em>. (BTW, in Hebrew the expression would be (literally ) &#039;everyone are in the same head&#039;, which is a cool way to make some sense of the &#039;page&#039; kanji meaning &#039;head&#039; when used as a primitive).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jhgoforth">jhgoforth</a>] 5-7-2011(6): The <strong>topic</strong> is <em>just sooooo</em> <em>head</em>ing in the wrong direction.
