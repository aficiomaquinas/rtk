## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sannomiya">sannomiya</a>] 6-5-2007(147): The<strong> MONKEY</strong> likes to play hide and seek with the PACK of WILD DOGS by hiding in the LIDDED CROCK. But he is easy to see because the SCARF he always wears is at the base of the LIDDED CROCK. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 25-2-2007(129): To catch a <strong>monkey</strong>, chase him with <em>wild dogs</em> into a <em>lidded crock</em>, then tie it with a <em>scarf</em>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koiulpoi">koiulpoi</a>] 21-6-2009(77): Honestly, I hate the &quot;Lidded Crock with a scarf&quot; metaphor. It makes no sense, and I just can&#039;t get an image that &quot;sticks&quot; with it, at all. Besides, it sounds retarded. The original meaning of the whole right side of this Kanji is &quot;Long Kimono.&quot; So, put a wild dog in a kimono, stand him on two legs, and you&#039;ve got something that looks like a man but still feral - a<strong> monkey</strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Supraman">Supraman</a>] 15-11-2010(18): We should be starring the 2009-- stories, The 2006--2007 stories totally have a monopoly. GIVE THE NEW GUYS A CHANCE! ;) All you new guys star this. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mickymay">mickymay</a>] 1-5-2011(13): The upper right part means long kimono. 袁 is not in Heisig list, but if you remember it, you have an easier time later on. &quot;Long kimono&quot; is easier than &quot;lidded crock with scarf.&quot; For its story look at Kanji 34945. Story for   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/猿">猿</a>  : If you put wild dogs in long kimonos, they look like<strong> monkey</strong> really. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 12-10-2010(10): This kanji shows the<strong> Monkey</strong> King from Chinese legend. He has a pack of followers who behave like <em>wild dogs</em>; he wanders the <em>land</em> with Tripitaka, complaining loudly all the while (hence the open <em>mouth</em>); and he wears a magical headband (now a <em>scarf</em>) which compels his obedience. Warning: the bottom of the right-hand group is NOT the abbreviated version from <a href="../585">park</a> <span class="index">(#585 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/園">園</a>)</span>.<strong> Monkey</strong> wears elaborate clothing, so the kanji reflects that. さる. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johngwk">johngwk</a>] 25-8-2010(10): Desperate to escape from the pack of <em>wild dogs</em>, the<strong> monkey</strong> concealed himself in the <em>lidded crock pot</em>- but his whereabouts was given away by his fashionable <em>scarf</em>, still partially hanging outside.-. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 5-10-2008(9): When chased by <em>wild dogs</em>, a <a href="../244">cat</a> <span class="index">(#244 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/猫">猫</a>)</span> hides in a field of flowers, and the<strong> monkey</strong> hides in a <em>lidded crook</em> wrapped in a <em>scarf</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ojousan">ojousan</a>] 16-10-2009(8): (NOTE: I am combining <em>lidded crock</em> and <em>scarf</em> into one NEW PRIMITIVE: <em>picnic</em>. As in, a <em>lidded crock</em> is filled with the food and the <em>scarf</em> is the picnic blanket.) The clever <strong>monkey</strong> lured in the <em>wild dogs</em> with a delicious <em>picnic.</em> Once the dogs were distracted eating the food, he pushed them in the <em>lidded crock</em> and bundled the whole thing up with the <em>picnic blanket</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomusan">tomusan</a>] 20-2-2008(6): <strong>Monkey</strong>&#039;s are smarter than a <em>pack of wild dogs</em> for sure. That&#039;s probably why they live in <em>lidded crock</em>s and wear <em>scarfs</em> in Winter.
