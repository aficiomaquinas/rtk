heisig: "Do not think of a &quot;gift&quot; here, but of the <b>present</b> moment, as distinct from the future and the past. The kanji gives us a <i>ball</i> in which we see the <b>present</b>&nbsp;- obviously a crystal <i>ball</i> that enables us to <i>see</i> things going on at the <b>present</b> in faraway places."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mimiko">mimiko</a>] 20-8-2007(176): <em>The KING</em> ... can <em>SEE</em> clearly the<strong> PRESENT</strong> state of affairs in the land. (maybe he hees them in the crystal ball on the left?). 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indigo">indigo</a>] 4-1-2008(67): Hey, I want my money back! This crystal <em>ball</em> is out of order, I can <em>see</em> the<strong> present</strong> instead of the future! 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lmcrtk">lmcrtk</a>] 10-4-2009(37): Many people claim that Elvis (The KING) has been SEEN walking around in the<strong> PRESENT</strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lucianreign">lucianreign</a>] 6-12-2006(28): The king came...the king saw...thus, the king was<strong> present</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 29-10-2007(18): The palintir shows only what&#039;s happening NOW - the<strong> present</strong> - to the all-<em>see</em>ing eye of Sauron. Unfortunate overlap of keywords. I sometimes write   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/贈">贈</a>   <a href="../503">presents</a> <span class="index">(#503 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/贈">贈</a>)</span> when given this keyword for review. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Izumo">Izumo</a>] 20-3-2010(9): The ultimate <strong>jewel</strong> to <strong>see</strong> is The<strong> PRESENT</strong>. [J. Krishnamurti]. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/beth266">beth266</a>] 3-8-2009(9): The<strong> present</strong> king cannot see; he is blind! 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/claxton">claxton</a>] 21-6-2008(9): For a Buddhist country, understanding that the<strong> present</strong> holds everything of value is essential. In this character, they call it what the &quot;king sees&quot;. If we all lived in the<strong> present</strong> and had the king&#039;s ability of sight, the world would be a better place. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 9-6-2008(9): This means<strong> present</strong> as in &quot;the<strong> present</strong> situation.&quot; This kanji also means, &quot;to appear; to come into sight, to become visible.&quot; STORY: The KING of this village is an evil wizard who can SEE all the<strong> PRESENT</strong> situations; and if you do something bad, he will just APPEAR in your house (using magic) and turn you into a toad. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rivvie">Rivvie</a>] 25-1-2008(6): The <em>king</em> says he can predict the future. He&#039;s not very good at it yet though... He can only <em>see</em> the<strong> present</strong>.
