## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erikkusan">erikkusan</a>] 20-3-2006(321): The first computer in the world was as<strong> heavy</strong> as thousand computers are now.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 21-4-2006(36): To me it looks like a car with two extra wheels, like a truck. As it is a very<strong> heavy</strong> vehicle I suggest an image of a huge mining truck, like the yellow Liebherr T282B. Remember that the first &quot;wheel&quot; is a bit bent. <a href="http://www.primidi.com/2004/06/21.html">http://www.primidi.com/2004/06/21.html</a>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yuriehoshii">yuriehoshii</a>] 31-5-2011(15): TRỌNG : A CAR 車 WITH DOUBLE WHEELS , TOO<strong> HEAVY</strong> !!! EASY , YEAH !

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TsunamiEddi">TsunamiEddi</a>] 29-3-2011(11): <em>1000</em>（ 千 ）<em>computers</em> ( 里 )　are so<strong> heavy</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 9-7-2009(8): A<strong> heavy</strong> duty <em>truck</em> with four-wheel drive.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/digicult">digicult</a>] 16-6-2009(5): The first <em>computer</em> in the world was as<strong> heavy</strong> as a <em>thousand</em> computers are now. As a primitive, I use a <strong>Hummer</strong>, because it&#039;s one of the heaviest passenger vehicles you can buy.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 10-9-2006(5): While one <em>ri</em> is easy to walk, try and walk a <em>thousand</em> and your legs will become<strong> heavy</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sskaggs">sskaggs</a>] 13-8-2011(4): Here, one of those trucks with an extra set of wheels in the back for<strong> heavy</strong> loads ( 車 + 2 extra wheels) carries a particularly<strong> heavy</strong> load. In fact, this truck is carrying <em>1,000 computers</em>. That&#039;s some serious stuff.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Seiska">Seiska</a>] 23-1-2011(4): This computer is a<strong> heavy</strong> one, it weights a Ton(metric - 1000kg).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sekiei">sekiei</a>] 29-3-2012(2): Hint: As a primitive, I see this as a lorry or a truck, a <em>vehicle</em> with double the amount of wheels. A <em>lorry</em> is<strong> heavy</strong> its self, and also used to carry<strong> heavy</strong> goods. Such as the <em>thousand computers</em> here.
