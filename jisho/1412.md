## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 19-9-2007(223): <em>The Pinnacle</em> is actually <em>bound up</em> by supports from <em>olden times</em>. Eventually, they give out, and the whole thing starts to<strong> collapse</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 19-12-2007(91): <em>The Pinnacle</em> is supported by pilings which were <em>bound up</em> in <em>olden times</em>. One day when the bindings rot away, the whole thing will<strong> collapse</strong>. (tweaking dihutensoa&#039;s story to work a little better for me).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 6-8-2008(40): At the pinnacle of any society&#039;s development, being overly bound to rules from olden times leads to<strong> collapse</strong> (see Jared Diamond&#039;s<strong> Collapse</strong>).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 24-1-2008(24): The adventurers reached the <em>pinnacle</em>, and claimed the artefact which had been <em>bound up</em> since <em>olden times</em>: the <em>staff</em> of the <em>Sun</em> God. But as soon as they removed it, the place began to<strong> collapse</strong>! Will they make it out in time??

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genevere">genevere</a>] 25-4-2009(11): The<strong> collapse</strong> of the pinnacle society occurred after they were <em>bound up</em> in <em>olden times</em> beliefs and practices and thereby failed to progress.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akira">akira</a>] 12-12-2007(8): The pinnacle was bounded up in the old days in order to not<strong> collapse</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kriskelvin">kriskelvin</a>] 1-12-2009(6): One day, the oppressive capitalist order of <em>The Pinnacle</em> will<strong> collapse</strong>. The inhabitants will be <em>bound up</em> and stood against the wall, as they did it in <em>olden times</em> in Mother Russia.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 17-11-2009(6): The<strong> collapse</strong> of the <em>pinnacle</em> came when it&#039;s supports, which had been <em>bound up</em> in <em>olden times</em> rotted away. (Thanks to dihutenosa and dwhitman).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 2-12-2006(4): [collapse; fall into; cave in; fall (castle); slide into] If your company <strong>collapse</strong>s (even if it was at its <em>pinnacle</em>), the reason would probably be <em>bound up</em> in the <em>olden times</em> policies (only modern companies stay at the <em>pinnacle</em>).
