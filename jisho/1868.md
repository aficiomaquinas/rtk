## Heisig V6:

After the <i>drop</i> and the <i>glass canopy</i>, we come to a combination of three strokes that we met only once before, in the character for <i>mama</i> (frame 105). The pictographic meaning we gave it there has no etymological relationship to this character, but use it if it helps.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 29-6-2006(188): I see this kanji as a pictograph of a two story<strong> boat</strong> seen from the front. The <em>glass canopy</em> is the body of the<strong> boat</strong>. The <em>drop</em> on top is the chimney. The horizontal line is the <em>ceiling/floor</em> between the the 1st/2nd floor. Finally, the <em>two drops</em> in the middle are the lights on the decks.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jajaaan">jajaaan</a>] 1-1-2010(54): Pictograph of a<strong> boat</strong> seen from above. The middle line is the oars. The drop on top is the rudder (at the back of the<strong> boat</strong>). The two drops inside represent the passengers: one is bent over with the effort of rowing and the other is sitting up straight, in the front of the<strong> boat</strong>, looking at the horizon for any signs of land.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 2-1-2007(29): Cinnabar ( 丹 ) colored<strong> boat</strong>, the extra drop signifying that the paint hasn&#039;t dried yet. The stick represents the oars.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 21-1-2009(26): I <em>dropped</em> a<strong> boat</strong> on your <em>mom</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 17-2-2010(9): New Primitive: <em>Titanic</em> with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 22-10-2009(9): A <a href="../2038">rust-colored/cinnabar</a> (#2038 丹) coloured<strong> boat</strong> viewed front-on, as pictured in the link. The <em>drop</em> on top is the mast (or the chimney if you like), and the vertical line, the bow of the ship. <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/202/535691602_81e0cebcba.jpg">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/202/535691602_81e0cebcba.jpg</a>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 11-7-2009(8): Try not to get any <em>drops</em> on the navigational <em>AI</em> of the<strong> boat</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stryder">Stryder</a>] 17-2-2008(8): A <em>mother</em> is nursing her child beneath the <em>glass canopy</em> of a speed<strong>boat</strong>. A sudden <em>drop</em> of seagull poop on the glass startles her, causing her right breast to flop out of her shirt and the baby&#039;s mouth. Her breast&#039;s lack of clothing is represented by the lack of a bottom stroke for the quasi-<em>mother</em> primitive.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 7-3-2011(5): This is Kate Winslet, as seen by Leonardo DiCaprio (ie, from behind), with the fateful iceberg dead ahead. Not sure what the first stroke is...maybe a rather alarmed penguin, wondering to itself, &quot;Hey, is that ship gonna turn away or what?&quot; 舟 (ふね) : ship,<strong> boat</strong>, watercraft, shipping, vessel, steamship.
