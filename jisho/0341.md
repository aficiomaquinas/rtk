heisig: The personalism connoted by the word <b>instruction</b>, as opposed to "teaching" or "discipline," suits the picture here of <i>words</i> guiding one's progress like the gentle flowing of a <i>stream</i>. Even the etymology of the word <b>instruction</b> suggests the sense of "pouring into".
