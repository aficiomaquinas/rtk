## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 14-10-2007(292): You<strong> pick</strong> cheries with your <em>fingers</em>, then along comes a giant <em>vulture</em> and<strong> pick</strong>s up the whole <em>tree</em> with its <em>claws</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 20-2-2008(87): Tip: <em>vulture</em> + <em>tree</em> : Heisig later combines these into a single kanji 采 called <a href="../2090">grab</a> (#2090 采). Story: As you go to<strong> pick</strong> your nose, your parent <em>grabs</em> your <em>finger</em> and pulls it away (&amp; gives you a lecture on social etiquette). REF: &quot;grab&quot; also appears in <a href="../734">vegetable</a> (#734 菜), <a href="../1714">coloring</a> (#1714 彩).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 17-8-2007(44): Attempting to use your FINGERS to<strong> PICK</strong> the fruit off the TREE can be hazardous if there&#039;s a VULTURE waiting to<strong> PICK</strong> your FINGERS off you!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/trusmis">trusmis</a>] 6-9-2009(30): 采 is grab (FRAME <a href="../2090">grab</a> (#2090 采))<strong> Pick</strong> is grab but delicately with your fingers only (thanks katsuo).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 29-10-2008(21): Imagine trying to<strong> pick</strong> fruit from a <em>vulture</em>-infested <em>tree</em>, but before you can even get close, the <em>vultures</em> peck at your <em>fingers</em> to stop you.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 2-1-2010(9): Wolverine climbed up a <em>tree</em> in order to<strong> pick</strong> his nose with his <em>finger</em> (he&#039;d cut himself if he used his claws). He didn&#039;t want any of the other X-men to see him cause they wouldn&#039;t think he was cool anymore.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/igordesu">igordesu</a>] 17-1-2009(6): If you&#039;re gonna<strong> pick</strong> your nose, don&#039;t be a wimp. Just be honest. Sometimes you need more than your finger; get your claws up in there. If it&#039;s really bad, well, don&#039;t hesitate to use tree branch or something. Git-er-dun.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pjhoover">pjhoover</a>] 20-3-2008(5): From disney&#039;s jungle book song &quot;bare necessities&quot; Now when you<strong> pick</strong> a pawpaw Or a prickly pear And you prick a raw paw Next time beware Don&#039;t<strong> pick</strong> the prickly pear by the paw When you<strong> pick</strong> a pear Try to use the claw.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 18-12-2007(5): E.T. and Wolverine sneak into the apple orchard at night and<strong> pick</strong> all the apples off the trees before sunrise.
