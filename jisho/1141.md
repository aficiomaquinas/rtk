## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 6-6-2006(518): Pinnochio gets frustrated that every time he utters a <em>word</em> of a<strong> lie</strong>, his nose grows and he has to get the <em>saw</em> out again.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 23-4-2008(44): Her<strong> lie</strong>s are words that cut not like a knife, no not cleanly, but savagely like a saw.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Piitaa">Piitaa</a>] 3-7-2006(23): Hint: I think of<strong> lie</strong>s as <em>serrated words</em> for some reason.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 24-11-2008(12): This really has the connotation of fraud rather than<strong> lie</strong> but the Pinnochio story works too well.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nicjsb">nicjsb</a>] 3-10-2008(8): His words were false; I saw right through his<strong> lie</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 14-7-2010(5): <strong>Lie</strong>s are <em>words</em> that <em>saw</em> away at the truth.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tummai">tummai</a>] 26-5-2008(5): I looked closely at the blade of my <em>saw</em>. Etched into the metal, I could see some tiny <em>words</em>. I used a magnifying glass to make the words bigger and read them aloud. &quot;This is an elephant.&quot; Well, that&#039;s obviously a<strong> lie</strong>!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 27-12-2008(4): &quot;<em>Socrates</em>, have you seen the movie <em>Saw</em>?&quot; &quot;No!&quot; &quot;Soc, stop spreading such<strong> lie</strong>s! The dvd cover&#039;s sticking out of your back pocket, mate.&quot; OR <em>Socrates</em> and the <em>Jigsaw Killer</em> from the film Saw are locked in battle of words. Jigsaw thinks Soc is a liar, and Soc in turn screams back that everything Jigsaw says is a<strong> lie</strong>!!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu">ruisu</a>] 6-12-2007(4): I <em>saw</em> right through his <em>words</em> and <strong>lies</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 25-5-2013(3): Pinocchio tries not to<strong> lie</strong>, he tries harder than most because every <em>word</em> he says that is a<strong> lie</strong> makes his nose grow longer, as we all know. Shopping with his girlfriend is a particularly fraught time. She is wont to ask things like &quot;Does my bum look big in this?&quot;, &quot;Are you bored?&quot; &quot;Am I too old to wear this?&quot; &quot;Does this make me look fat?&quot; etc. It has got to the stage where poor Pinocchio has to carry a <em>saw</em> with him whenever he&#039;s with her, lest she spots him in a<strong> lie</strong>. (thanks wrightak).
