heisig: "This is the character for the little wooden box that the Japanese use for measuring things, as well as for drinking saké out of. Simply imagine the outside as spiked with a <i>thousand</i> sharp <i>needles</i>, and the quaint little <b>measuring box</b> becomes a drinker's nightmare! Be very careful when you write this character not to confuse it with the writing of <i>thousand</i>. The reason for the difference gives us a chance to clarify another general principle of writing that supersedes the one we mentioned in frame 4: when a single stroke runs vertically through the middle of a character, it is written last."
