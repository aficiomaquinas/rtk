## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyland1">Hyland1</a>] 7-2-2007(294): The line of viking soldiers is always accompanied by a horn mending specialist.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 17-12-2007(163): I&#039;m <em>going</em> to<strong> accompany</strong> the <em>horny</em> girl to her room so I can &quot;mend&quot; her.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 11-11-2007(91): As you&#039;re <em>going</em> along someplace, you pause to <em>mend</em> a wounded <em>animal&#039;s horns</em>, and it decides to <em>go</em> with you, to<strong> accompany</strong> you as a pet/sidekick, out of gratitude.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 29-1-2009(72): Japanese Folklore:----------- <em>Mend</em> the <em>Horns</em> of an Oni, and he will<strong> accompany</strong> you on your travels, <em>Going</em> anywhere you choose.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 12-11-2008(23): The symbol on the right works well as Horny Repairman (mender) so you can imagine a porn character like a cable repairman that shows up at the door, and a beautiful girl answers (having seen the Big Lebowski helps with this visual). But instead of coming in, he asks the girl to<strong> accompany</strong> him to his van and she obeys and goes with him. &quot;obey&quot; is the primary meaning of this kanji so it&#039;s good to work it into the visual.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 27-2-2008(10): Each <em>column</em> in a Viking army is always accompanied by a <em>horn</em> <em>mending</em> specialist! You can hear soldiers calling for him on the battlefield: &#039;Horn down, horn down!&#039; (thanks Hyland1).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruukukun">ruukukun</a>] 29-6-2010(8): You are <em>going</em> along your travels when you come across a poor Oni on the side of the road (<a href="http://www.printsofjapan.com/images/Oni.jpg">http://www.printsofjapan.com/images/Oni.jpg</a>) with broken <em>horns</em>. You <em>mend</em> his <em>horns</em> and then he <em>goes</em> with you on your journey, <strong>accompany</strong>ing you wherever you go to a happy cheery song medley. What a great movie montage! And what better (<strong>ac</strong>)<strong>company</strong> than an Oni! (From Cerulean).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 22-8-2007(6): <em>The Flash</em> asked me to <strong>accompany</strong> him when we went to get the <em>horns</em> on his helmet <em>mended</em>. It was quite a day trip!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 19-4-2008(5): Is your husband not always happy to<strong> accompany</strong> you? Then you need the iHornMend, Apple&#039;s revolutionary new device that automatically <em>mends</em> your husband&#039;s <em>horniness</em>, ensuring he&#039;ll stop running off with younger girls and will<strong> accompany</strong> you obediently wherever you want to go.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zanzibar">zanzibar</a>] 31-5-2009(4): Noah got a lot of animals to LINE UP and<strong> accompany</strong> him by MENDING their HORNS.
