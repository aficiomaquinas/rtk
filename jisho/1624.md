2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Proxx">Proxx</a>] 27-11-2007(65): Remember the two<strong> tower</strong>s from lord of the rings... <em>each</em> has it&#039;s own - very difficult to master - entrance <em>gate</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(5): Playing <strong>Tower</strong> Defence, you put a <strong>tower</strong> at <em>each</em> <em>gate</em> to make sure you kill all the monsters, no matter where they spawn. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/effer">effer</a>] 17-2-2012(4): <strong>Tower</strong> =<strong> tower</strong> defence game. EACH<strong> tower</strong> has it&#039;s own unique security GATE. Some with mounted canons, others with lasers.
