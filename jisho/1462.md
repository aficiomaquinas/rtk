Consider for a moment the etymology of the word &quot;<b>promise</b>&quot; in order to notice its roots in the activity of putting one thing (e.g., one's word of honor) in place of another (e.g., the fulfillment of a task). For as it turns out, this character also means &quot;to abridge, economize, and abbreviate&quot; - all activities that involve putting one thing in place of another. With that in mind, we may now work with the elements: <i>thread</i> . . . <i>ladle</i>.
