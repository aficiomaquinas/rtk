## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 10-5-2007(178): Ahh, a fine<strong> sultry</strong> day with my <em>love doll</em> under the hot <em>sun</em>. I think she&#039;s getting a tan! 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 5-11-2007(71): [from decamer0n] This is the kanji for atsui (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/暑い">暑い</a>  ) as in hot. If you&#039;ve ever been in Japan in the summer no doubt you have heard hoards of people bellowing &quot;Atsui! Atsui!&quot; Here you are laying with your <em>love doll</em> under the hot <em>sun.</em> Luckily the manufacturers were smart and when the doll got to hot it would bellow &quot;Atsui! It&#039;s so<strong> sultry</strong>!&quot;. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 24-5-2009(48): Ever wonder why <em>ninjas</em> only operate at night? It&#039;s to avoid the<strong> sultry</strong> <em>sun</em> of course! 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 3-12-2008(18): You make a <em>voodoo doll</em> in your own image and set it down under the <em>sun</em>, on a deserted tropical island so you can feel the benefits of<strong> sultry</strong> weather all year round. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nebusoku">nebusoku</a>] 20-8-2009(8): On even the most<strong> sultry</strong> <em>day</em>s, <em>Pinocchio</em> can stand under the hot summer <em>sun</em> and it doesn&#039;t bother him one bit because he&#039;s made of wood! 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 20-1-2007(8): On one of those prohibitively<strong> sultry</strong> days when the <em>sun</em> blares down on the earth, only <em>Chucky</em> is out of the shade and running around. He has no sweat glands and so isn&#039;t bothered. The rest of the children are taking whatever shelter they can and sitting very still. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 1-3-2006(8): Two <em>suns</em> with the <em>earth</em> sweating (the drop) in the<strong> sultry</strong> heat. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Fangio">Fangio</a>] 15-2-2012(5): Used in &quot;atsui&quot; (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/暑い">暑い</a>  ): it means hot, but only for <strong>hot weather</strong>: don&#039;t confuse it with the other kanji for &quot;hot&quot;, this one is used only when <em>SOMEONE</em> is sweating under the <em>SUN</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SwiftyFrisco">SwiftyFrisco</a>] 25-6-2010(4): <strong>Two suns</strong>, <strong>old man</strong> = Ben Kenobi on Tatooine. That was one hot and<strong> sultry</strong> place. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtcamero">dtcamero</a>] 15-6-2010(3): <em>NINJA</em>S operate at night because all that black gets hot in the <em>SULTRY</em> Japanese sun...
