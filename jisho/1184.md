## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the_marshal">the_marshal</a>] 30-4-2006(209): <strong>Once upon a time</strong>, the children were forced to eat their salad every day. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andye">andye</a>] 11-1-2007(147): For those who don&#039;t know the expression, &quot;salad days&quot; means the time of one&#039;s youth. (originally from Shakespeare&#039;s Antony and Cleopatra - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_days">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_days</a>). I suspect Heisig chose &quot;salad&quot; as the name for the radical just for this phrase... 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 20-10-2007(107): <strong>Once upon a time</strong> there was a McDonald&#039;s <em>salad</em> and it was left out in the sun for a whole <em>day</em>. But ... nothing happened because it was a McDonald&#039;s salad, chock full of preservatives and other garbage. The salad lived happily ever after (and so did the person who didn&#039;t eat it). The end. [I didn&#039;t write this... the original author deleted it... but it&#039;s my favourite story on the whole site.]. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 31-1-2010(19): This is the kanji for &quot;mukashi&quot;. Often used for &quot;once upon a time&quot; or &quot;long time ago&quot;. I will take this kanji to mean &quot;really fucking long time ago&quot;......A really fucking long time ago, I use to eat <em>salad</em> every <em>day</em> and was very slim.....those days are long gone and I&#039;m now fat as a pig... 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 2-3-2009(8): <strong>Once upon a time</strong> there was a ruler called <em>ceaser</em> (shiza sarada). He ruled everything under the <em>sun</em>, even the <em>sun</em> worshiping egyptians, until one <em>day</em> he was killed and then his <em>sun</em> Augustous took over. I think Ceaser will be an easier primitive than<strong> once upon a time</strong>. N.B. It&#039;s worked really well for me over the next couple of kanji. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 19-5-2008(8): There is a popular manga called <em>salad days</em>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad-Days">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad-Days</a> Although I&#039;ve never read it, its the first thing I thought of when I saw this kanji. It&#039;s a story about... I dunno, some girls or something. But how do stories usually start? &quot;Once upon a time&quot;. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjiwarrior">kanjiwarrior</a>] 29-4-2009(5): <strong>Once upon a time</strong> Mr. Spock tossed someone&#039;s salad all day long, he likes anal sex. シャク、セキ. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raschaverak">Raschaverak</a>] 10-8-2009(4): <strong>Once upon a time</strong> there was a vegetarian who ate salad all day…and became the person who lived til the oldest known age in history (135 years!). Primitive meaning: vegetarian. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epsilondelta">epsilondelta</a>] 14-12-2009(3): Hint: I imagine all stories containing this primitive as a story told by a parent to a kid (like a fairy tale). This way I mentally distinguish it from <a href="../1016">long time</a> <span class="index">(#1016 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/久">久</a>)</span> (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/久">久</a>  ) and <a href="../35">olden times</a> <span class="index">(#35 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/旧">旧</a>)</span> (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/旧">旧</a>  ). 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stringy_cow">stringy_cow</a>] 23-3-2009(3): For some reason if I think of the top of looking like the top of a castle it helps. And the days i below because it&#039;s usually about days long ago.
