## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 30-12-2006(141): I had the same idea as fuabrisu. A generic person is described here as having body sort of like a tree trunk and head sort of like a wicker basket.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 2-3-2008(73): Two girls with a lollipop in a tree gossiping&#039; so-and so did this.&#039; &#039;really? so-and what did she do&#039; &#039; o she is sooo wrong..&#039;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 3-7-2009(43): Lately I&#039;ve been seeing a lot of<strong> so-and-so</strong> girls on the street. They have <em>sweet</em> faces, but their bodies look like <em>tree</em> trunks. It&#039;s like, damn bitch, if I had your potential, I&#039;d lay off the donuts and hit the gym more often.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 30-9-2007(41): When <em>Willy Wonka</em> went into the jungle to search for the Oompaloompas, they at first believed him to be a malicious<strong> so-and-so</strong>, and so they chased him up a <em>tree</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 22-11-2005(31): Tip : you can make<strong> so-and-so</strong> a person, which will help with the following kanji. Mr<strong> so-and-so</strong> has no defining features, i.e. no mouth, no eyes, just a grey blob.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stshores24">stshores24</a>] 29-9-2008(16): Tattletale: &#039;Mom! <strong>So-and-so</strong> took my <em>wicker basket</em> and threw it up in the <em>tree</em> so I can&#039;t get to it!&#039;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 7-2-2008(12): <strong>So-and-so</strong> sounds much like a young schoolgirl phrase. Another young schoolgirl phrase is &quot;you and<strong> so-and-so</strong> sitting in a tree. k. i. s. s. i. n. g.&quot; Oh, and you&#039;re also eating honey from a <em>honey pot</em> with your companion. Or, think of your partner&#039;s mouth (or, ahem) as the &quot;<em>honey pot</em>&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jotakami">jotakami</a>] 15-3-2010(8): A childhood taunt: You and<strong> so-and-so</strong>, sitting in a <em>tree</em>, K-I-S-S-I-N-G. First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes baby in the <em>wicker basket</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 12-7-2010(5): A spoiled little<strong> so-and-so</strong> throws another kids candy up in a tree. What a jerk!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jackswitch">jackswitch</a>] 26-3-2009(4): <em>Willy Wonka</em> is showing people around the chocolate factory. &quot;And over here, we have the<strong> so-and-so</strong> <em>tree</em>.&quot; &quot;The<strong> so-and-so</strong> <em>tree</em>?
