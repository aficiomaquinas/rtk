## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 5-1-2007(203): Obviously this is the rabbit from Alice, excusing himself and rushing away on his legs, as he has a binding day schedule. This is at the same time an image, with bound=ears, day=head and legs are just legs. The image is used in <a href="../2093">rabbit</a> (#2093 兎).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 7-1-2008(48): What is the rabbit&#039;s<strong> excuse</strong> for being such a jerk? Well he was b<em>ound up for a whole day</em> while being stepped on by peoples <em>human legs</em> in some make-up labratory. Yeah I think I can<strong> excuse</strong> him after knowing that.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 3-7-2009(43): &#039;&#039;<strong>Excuse</strong> me.&#039;&#039; Jessica <strong>Rabbit</strong> walks past you, <em>bound up</em> in a red sequinned dress in which her voluptuous <em>tatas</em> are sublimely complemented by her long <em>legs</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 7-12-2006(18): The <em>rabbit</em> always thinks that &quot;Trix are for kids!&quot; is a terrible<strong> excuse</strong> for stealing his breakfast.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tinonet">tinonet</a>] 30-1-2010(15): This is a <em>Bugs Bunny</em> with <em>bound</em> up ears and big <em>teeth in the mouth</em>. As you know, he has kinda <em>human legs</em> as well....So he says: Eeeeh, <strong>EXCUSE</strong> me, what&#039;s up Doc?

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 8-8-2008(10): This is used in &quot; <a href="midori://search?text=御免ください”">御免ください”</a> but does not really mean &quot;excuse&quot; its self, such as 言い訳 or the like. It means &quot;dismissal.&quot; So &quot;Excuse me&quot; = &quot;dismiss me please.&quot; STORY: The Trix RABBIT had enough, he could not DISMISS/EXCUSE all the crap he has had to put up with to get the cereal, so this DAY, he BOUND UP the kids so that only their HUMAN legs are showing and got the Trix.　.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-1-2006(9): Tip : for some reason this kanji is classified with the &quot;color&quot; radical (see frame 1753) in my Japanese text editor. Although it alters the stroke order and stroke count, it may be easier to remember this as the &quot;color&quot; primitive, with the lower part broken and shifted to the right, and another leg added where it is missing. Tie this up with the mnemonic : when you give an<strong> excuse</strong>, you &quot;break a color&quot; (as in the expression &quot;to break a sweat&quot;), and your face becomes coloured with embarrassment.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 21-6-2008(8): I find it easier to remember this based on the kanji for <a href="../1753">color</a> (#1753 色) This is the <em>Trix Rabbit</em>, always running on his surprisingly <em>human legs</em> after that <em>color</em>ful cereal, always being shot down with the same<strong> excuse</strong>: &quot;Silly rabbit, trix are for kids!&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shaydwyrm">shaydwyrm</a>] 20-7-2007(8): A <em>teenager</em> uses the<strong> excuse</strong> that he has a &quot;splitting headache&quot; (<em>split-headed teenager</em>) to stay <em>bound up</em> in bed instead of working.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 10-12-2009(5): The rabbit asked to be<strong> excuse</strong>d because he forgot his 丶, as seen in 兔.
