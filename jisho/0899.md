## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 27-11-2008(253): Together with the next kanji, the keywords spell “send back the<strong> ring</strong>”. First we have a <em>jewel</em>. Next we have the <em>great eye</em> of Sauron searching for the fellowship hiding under the many <em>ceilings</em> during their journey. The fourth and fifth primitives are the <em>mouth</em> of Gollum always mumbling “My preciousss”; and Pippin&#039;s <em>scarf</em>! Placement: the eye appears at the top similarly to how the Great Eye of Sauron is perched atop the Dark Tower.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shinyclef">shinyclef</a>] 28-4-2009(8): (Just some trivia for those interested. 睘 is a Chinese character that means &#039;round&#039; or &#039;stare&#039;.
