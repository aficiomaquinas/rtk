## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akotkav">akotkav</a>] 5-3-2006(224): When someone&#039;s <em>elbow</em> is above your <em>mouth</em> he/she is probably standing on a<strong> pedestal</strong>.

You&#039;re extremely proud of your accomplishment as you step up to receive your medal. The guy in first place is up on a<strong> pedestal</strong>, towering above you, his elbow level with your mouth. Being a smug bastard, he &quot;accidentally&quot; knocks his elbow into your mouth, causing you to bleed and lose a tooth. Just cause he won the gold doesn&#039;t mean he can place himself on such a high<strong> pedestal</strong> and do whatever he wants!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 16-11-2007(96): Rodin&#039;s &#039;Thinker&#039; sitting on a<strong> pedestal</strong>, the arm bent at the <em>elbow</em> cradling the <em>mouth</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 30-10-2008(17): Imagine yourself standing in 2nd place on a<strong> pedestal</strong>, the winner&#039;s <em>elbow</em> right by your <em>mouth</em>. You think &quot;Bite it! Go on!&quot;... but you don&#039;t. That would be weird.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 30-11-2006(9): The lost <em>elbows</em> of the Venus de Milo have been found! The museum-goers stand in awe with their <em>mouths</em> agape as they stare at them on a<strong> pedestal</strong>.

Together these guys act as a human <strong>STAND</strong> (or<strong> PEDESTAL</strong>) onto which they next balance vehicles! <strong>COUNT</strong> the <strong>VEHICLES</strong> yourself ladies and gentlemen... drum roll please ... <strong>ONE VEHICLE</strong>... <strong>TWO VEHICLES</strong>... How can these <strong>TAIWAN</strong>ese circus performers do this, you exclaim aloud. [A].
