heisig: "Unlike the river, the ocean, the lake, and the pond, the <b>creek</b> is often no more then a dribble of <i>water</i> trickling down a small gully. While the geological history of the larger bodies of <i>water</i> is hard to surmise sometimes, all of us know from our childhood how <b>creeks</b> are made. You probably even dug one or two in your time. All you need to do is find a mainstream of <i>water</i> somewhere and dig a little path into dry land. The <b>creek</b> is thus a lesson in <i>water-craft</i>, as this kanji would agree."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 12-12-2007(136): A<strong> CREEK</strong> is a small trail of <em>water</em> easily <em>craft</em>ed with a stick.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nwatkins">nwatkins</a>] 18-9-2007(83): <strong>Creek</strong>s are small water, easily crossed with a simple i-beam.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indigo">indigo</a>] 21-12-2007(35): Using <em>water</em> and some <em>craft</em>, one can make a<strong> creek</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 15-3-2007(24): This Kanji can carry the meaning of &quot;creek&quot;, &quot;inlet&quot;, or &quot;bay&quot; actually. Although the meaning of inlet and bay seem to pop up for me more than instances of it meaning<strong> creek</strong> (I often question Hesig&#039;s choices of these key words, even if his method does seem to be effective). Still... I guess right now I&#039;m using the image of a witch who practices her &quot;craft&quot; next to a watery<strong> creek</strong> leading into an inlet/bay.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kirihitokiri">kirihitokiri</a>] 9-3-2008(19): It is best to practice operating <em>water</em> <em>craft</em> in a<strong> creek</strong> before going to rivers or the sea...

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 30-11-2007(9): A<strong> creek</strong> is where the coast has been carved by <em>water</em>, it&#039;s the result of <em>water</em>-<em>craft</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 17-7-2008(7): Imagine some crazy beavers damming up a<strong> creek</strong> but instead of using branches and stuff, they use an <em>I-beam</em>!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo">NooNoo</a>] 24-4-2008(6): This also means <strong>bay</strong>, so I have that in my story: A <em>carpenter</em> ( 工 =craft, carpenter) built a wooden device/dam to lead <em>water</em> from the <strong>bay</strong> into his own little<strong> creek</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yurypetrov">yurypetrov</a>] 16-4-2011(4): The running water crafted a<strong> creek</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tman755">tman755</a>] 8-12-2009(3): Bender wades into the water of a<strong> creek</strong> a<strong> creek</strong>. &quot;I&#039;m up sh**<strong> creek</strong> without a paddle!&quot; he screams.
