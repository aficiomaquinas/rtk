## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 17-12-2007(219): &quot;This is the<strong> first time</strong> we&#039;ve been out of the Shire, Mr. Frodo!&quot; Says Sam, covering himself with his cloak and clutching his dagger.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy">howdycowdy</a>] 4-3-2008(127): On his<strong> FIRST TIME</strong>, he <em>cloaked</em> his <em>dagger</em> with a Trojan.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Captain_Thunder">Captain_Thunder</a>] 28-12-2008(50): Not only did I put on my robe and wizard&#039;s hat for my<strong> first time</strong>, but also my cloak and my dagger. That&#039;s when she walked out on me.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codewolke">Codewolke</a>] 16-6-2009(25): Your GF can get pregnant even on the <strong>first time</strong>... so from the <strong>first time</strong> on you should put a <em>cloak</em> on your <em>sword</em> (condom).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Atomik">Atomik</a>] 30-9-2009(16): The<strong> first time</strong> I tried on my new <em>cloak</em>, I discovered the inside was lined with <em>daggers</em>. There was no second time.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 25-10-2007(13): Yet another Freudian one. She voluntarily removes her <em>cloak</em> before her<strong> FIRST TIME</strong> with...um...a <em>sword</em>. Note: I keep wanting to add the 口 primitive to this. Remember, she&#039;s removing her cloak voluntarily - she&#039;s not being seduced.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Chocobonstrife">Chocobonstrife</a>] 26-4-2012(10): The CLOAK and DAGGER trick only works the<strong> first time</strong>, when the element of surprise is there. Anyone would be a fool to fall for it twice.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kissthestars">kissthestars</a>] 29-5-2009(9): The<strong> first time</strong> I wore the invisibility <em>cloak</em> somebody accidently stabbed me with a <em>dagger</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KANJI">KANJI</a>] 24-11-2006(9): From the Devil&#039;s Dictionary: Her engorged, fleshy lips protrude from her <strong>CLOAK</strong> ready for rear entry but, alas, the <strong>SWORD</strong> halts for this is her<strong> FIRST TIME</strong>!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nekoyaki">nekoyaki</a>] 11-1-2012(7): &quot;Why all the <em>cloak</em> and <em>dagger</em> stuff? Is it your<strong> first time</strong>?&quot; (said the old pro).
