Sun . . . straw man.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 16-5-2007(262): The <em>sun</em> rising beside a <em>straw man</em> in a corn field is a classic cartoon depiction of<strong> daybreak</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63">ashman63</a>] 14-6-2008(73): The first person to see the <em>sun</em> at<strong> daybreak</strong> is of course the <em>straw man</em> who stands outside all <em>day</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 4-10-2007(38): <strong>Daybreak</strong> comes and at the touch of the <em>sun</em> all the vampires instantly become <em>straw men</em>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xingji">xingji</a>] 1-10-2009(31): <a href="../v4/30">nightbreak</a> (#30 旦) was yoake 夜明け = or when the night brights up -<strong> daybreak</strong> is a akatsuki (the kun reading of this character), coming from akatoki =明時 which is the exact moment at which the SUN can give life to the STRAWMAN (it used to mean the period of time when it&#039;s still dark - before dawn) <a href="../v4/2448">dawn</a> (#2448 曙) is usually reserved for the figurative sense of beginning of a new era. to keep them separated i&#039;m sorting them chronologically as : 暁 (4 a.m)/曙(5:12:04)/旦(6 a.m).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 13-12-2006(12): I&#039;d like to see a<strong> daybreak</strong> more often but I&#039;m never up that early. So instead, I get my <em>Voodoo Doll</em> and leave it outside facing east. So it sees the <em>sun</em> rise up for me, whilst I&#039;m still sound asleep. (Hey, if it can transfer pain to me, it can transfer beautiful sights like this!).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 23-10-2011(7): New story: sune comes up on the bearded beginner.....sun coming up over the strawman............. *rant: So if &quot;night break&quot; means the night is broken (meaning dawn), wouldn&#039;t it follow that &quot;daybreak&quot; is dusk? Hesig is confusing sometimes. OK they both mean dawn -why not just use &quot;dawn&quot; instead of &quot;nightbreak&quot;??? .......I see....because there is also a kanji for dawn!! (2448 曙 ) and one for morning and rising sun! So i guess he just had to make up a new word.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cheesemaster64">Cheesemaster64</a>] 10-12-2008(5): Zelda OOT. To get the secret piece of heart you first have to play the <em>sun</em> song, (c left c down c up) then you play the strawman song (which was the one you got to make up.) The combination will bring you to<strong> daybreak</strong>, and then you can hookshot to the strawman.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/davidvance">davidvance</a>] 23-12-2009(3): Remember that scene in &quot;Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service&quot; where Kiki wakes up in the morning after<strong> daybreak</strong>, her legs sticking through the haystack in the cattle car?

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kansaigaijin">kansaigaijin</a>] 19-8-2009(3): The <em>strawman</em> is already in the field when the <em>sun</em> rises and <strong>daybreak</strong>s. In fact, he never left.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 27-9-2006(3): The <em>sun</em> comes up over the island at<strong> daybreak</strong> and <em>the wicker man</em> comes into view!
