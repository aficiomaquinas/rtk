## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 20-11-2007(169): The winner of the long<strong> jump</strong> competition was disqualified when they found he used a <em>pogo stick</em> tied to his <em>leg</em> to<strong> jump</strong> further. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 7-11-2009(106): The high <strong>jump</strong>er has his <em>wooden leg</em> fitted with a <em>pogo stick</em>, and can now<strong> jump</strong> even higher. (See my note at <a href="../1408">traffic</a> <span class="index">(#1408 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/通">通</a>)</span> for <em>pogo stick</em>). EDIT (2 years later): Keyword &quot;jump&quot; leads to confusion later on (see cjon256&#039;s post), <strong>&quot;Dancing&quot;</strong> would be better (but be sure to keep it distinct from <a href="../1774">dance</a> <span class="index">(#1774 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/舞">舞</a>)</span>). New Story: I was no good at <strong>dancing</strong> due to my <em>wooden leg</em>... until I had it fitted with a <em>pogo stick</em>! 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256">cjon256</a>] 27-6-2006(54): This is totally wrong. It doesn&#039;t mean &quot;jump&quot;, it means &quot;dance&quot;!   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/踊">踊</a>   <a href="../1409">jump</a> <span class="index">(#1409 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/踊">踊</a>)</span> and   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/曜">曜</a>   <a href="../1285">leap</a> <span class="index">(#1285 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/躍">躍</a>)</span> are homonyms, so it is easy to become permanently confused about which one DOES NOT mean &quot;jump/leap&quot;. Caveat Lector! Note:   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/舞">舞</a>   <a href="../1774">dance</a> <span class="index">(#1774 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/舞">舞</a>)</span> is quite a bit rarer (and not a homonym). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 29-4-2009(40): Heisig is triiippppiiiin&#039;. This means dance, not<strong> jump</strong>. I named the other &quot;dance&quot; kanji &quot;interpretive dance&quot; because it is used in all sorts of concepts figuratively related to dance, like stages, fluttering, etc. One of my<em> legs is wooden</em>, the other is a <em>pogo stick</em>. Surprisingly, I&#039;m actually a pretty good at <strong>dancing</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shizuru">Shizuru</a>] 27-8-2007(19): My wooden leg has a chop-seal at the end, but I have to<strong> jump</strong> so as to utilize it (so the chop-seal hits the right spot from above). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 20-9-2007(10): <em>Captain Ahab</em> was always a big fan of Kris Kross, but the Atlanta duo never could make him<strong> jump</strong> because of his wooden <a href="../1279">leg</a> <span class="index">(#1279 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/足">足</a>)</span>. But once they buy <em>Ahab</em> a <em>pogo stick</em>, he&#039;s out there<strong> jump</strong>in&#039; with the mac daddy and the daddy mac. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 20-5-2008(9): This actually takes more of the meaning of <strong>dance</strong> (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/踊る・おどる">踊る・おどる</a>  ） than<strong> jump</strong>.... with that said--- Remember that <strong>dance</strong> that Kriss Kross invented, and how Mac Daddy would make you<strong> jump</strong>,<strong> jump</strong>? imagine being at a <strong>dance-off</strong>, and to win at this dance you strap <em>pogo sticks</em> to your <em>legs</em>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 3-4-2008(7): The winner of the long<strong> jump</strong> event in the Special Olympics was disqualified after it was discovered that he had replaced his <em>wooden leg</em> with a <em>pogo-stick</em> -- a disability becomes a performance-enhancing cheat! (adapted from Vosmiura). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theich">theich</a>] 13-8-2009(6): Der Pirat hat sein <em>Holzbein</em> mit einem <em>Pogostick </em>ersetzt, um besser den Jig <strong>tanzen</strong> zu können. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cheesemaster64">Cheesemaster64</a>] 13-5-2009(6): Remember that <strong>dance</strong> from the 90&#039;s? &quot;Jump around!<strong> Jump</strong> around!<strong> Jump</strong> up and up and get down!&quot; Well if you have ever seen the music video from it, it is a whole bunch of <em>pirates on pogo sticks</em> dancing around! Also see MeisterLlama.
