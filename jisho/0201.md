heisig: "As the key word hints, the kanji in this frame refers to the late evening or early morning hours, well after one should be in bed asleep. It does this by picturing a <i>house</i> with a <i>candle</i> in it. The reason is obvious: whoever is living there is &quot;burning the <i>candle</i> at both ends,&quot; and working night after night into the <b>wee hours</b>."

## Heisig story:

It does this by picturing a <i>house</i> with a <i>candle</i> in it.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikes">mikes</a>] 7-5-2007(239): I burn the CANDLE in my HOUSE until the<strong> WEE HOURS</strong> reviewing the kanji!!!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD">PeterJD</a>] 3-4-2008(87): I agree with elktapestry. This kanji really means &quot;early evening&quot;, not &quot;wee hours&quot; [Heisig really should have done his homework on this and several other characters (e.g., #145 &quot;but of course&quot; -- what the hell???). Oh well.] &quot;Every <em>house</em> lights <em>candles</em> in the EARLY EVENING which stay lit until the<strong> wee hours</strong>&quot;. E.G. 宵の口 （よいのくち）early evening; 今宵 （こよい）this evening; tonight.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 27-3-2007(55): The fixed definition of this Kanji that Hesig gives seems deceptive and misleading. This not only refers to<strong> wee hours</strong> of the morning but also Evening and Early Night. So it seems to span the whole range of times when one might need a candle to work within the confines of one&#039;s house without daylight. Shows me that I can never trust one source of information exclusively, especially not Hesig. I thank him for this sytem of memorization, but still...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 8-2-2007(12): In the log <em>house</em> the <strong>wee hours</strong> are spent studying by <em>candle</em>light.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep">krungthep</a>] 9-5-2008(5): In the<strong> wee hours</strong> I usually stay at <em>home</em> lit by a <em>candle</em> playing with my <em>little</em> bit of <em>flesh</em> until it bears <em>resemblance</em> to a <em>candle</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tritonxg">tritonxg</a>] 25-1-2010(4): [FR]<strong>soirée</strong> japlt:N1 <strong>SHÔ yoi </strong> kanji&amp;kana:1854 <em>toit+bougie</em> <strong>soirée aux chandelles :</strong> pour passer une agréable SOIREE aux chandelles, on met des BOUGIES sous son TOIT 宵っぱり 【よいっぱり】night owl;nighthawk; sitting up late 宵の明星 【よいのみょうじょう】evening star; Venus 宵寝 【よいね】going to bed early 半宵 【はんしょう】midnight 春宵 【しゅんしょう】spring evening 宵越し 【よいごし】qui date de la veille.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 21-5-2008(4): 宵 【よい】 (n-adv,n-t) evening; early night hours; (P) STORY: As it gets later and into the EARLY NIGHT HOURS, regular HOUSES start to RESEMBLE haunted houses. (&quot;wee hours&quot; sounds a wee dorky).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KoiNoDensetsu">KoiNoDensetsu</a>] 6-12-2009(3): Before light bulbs were invented, the Japanese used to burn candles in their homes during the<strong> wee hours</strong> of the night.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS">TerryS</a>] 28-5-2009(3): You see a lit <em>candle</em> in her <em>house</em> because she&#039;s studying until the<strong> WEE HOURS</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 21-8-2011(2): Sparky in da house yo! paatee to da wee. (Reporters! I have dubbed 肖 (resemble ,or Hesig&#039;s &#039;candle&#039;) Sparky.) So, being a rather fun name, when in the house... let&#039;s party).
