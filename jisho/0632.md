Lost in his<strong> recollection</strong>, his <em>state of mind</em> was such that I could see he was reliving the experience as he was telling it to me. I remember thinking &quot;I have no <em>idea</em> what that must have been like to be 17 years old or so and have to face that sort of situation&quot;. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saeva">saeva</a>] 6-2-2008(6): According to the Platon&#039;s conception, the <strong>state</strong> of getting an <strong>idea</strong> is simply <strong>recollecting</strong> what our soul forgot long time ago.
