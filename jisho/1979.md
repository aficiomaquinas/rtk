## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 23-4-2007(207): The cute little innocent-looking plastic <strong>pony</strong> on the desk of a student is in fact a <em>trojan horse</em>, hiding <em>phrases</em> in its belly which are used for cheating during an exam. No <strong>pony</strong> will be permitted on desks during tests! 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 26-10-2007(94): A particular My Little<strong> Pony</strong> has a string that when you pull it, it repeats the same dumb phrase like &quot;I love you&quot;. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Balaam">Balaam</a>] 7-2-2008(28): A phrase used to insult horses - is<strong> pony</strong>. They hate that. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/WithLoveFromExIA">WithLoveFromExIA</a>] 20-6-2009(15): Lisa Simpson often utters the <em>phrase</em> &quot;Can I have a<strong> pony</strong>? Can I have a<strong> pony</strong>? Can I have a<strong> pony</strong>?&quot;. Finally Marge snaps &quot;No, not until you&#039;re older!&quot; &quot;But mum, it will be a <em>horse</em> by then.&quot;. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 17-3-2008(12): The<strong> Pony</strong> Express was a quick mail delivery service in old America. It actually used horses, not ponies, but the <em>phrase</em> &quot;Pony Express&quot; sounded better than &quot;Horse Express&quot;, and so they chose the better-sounding phrase as a marketing gimmick. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mary_K">Mary_K</a>] 10-5-2009(10): If a <em>team of horses</em> is a novel, then a <em>pony</em> is a <em>phrase</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 7-5-2008(7): Here we have a cute little innocent-looking plastic<strong> pony</strong> on the desk of a student, being in fact a <em>trojan horse</em>, hiding <em>phrases</em> in its belly which are used for cheating during an exam. -- Note that the kanji does in fact refer to a small horse, but the play on words help with this kanji and the story retains the image of a small horse. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 4-8-2008(6): This kanji is also commonly used to mean &quot;piece,&quot; such as a syougi piece. As we all know, unlike chess that uses crafted pieces, syougi pieces are like little<strong> PONY</strong>&#039;S that carry Chinese character PHRASES on them (such as   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/王">王</a>  ) to convey what piece they are. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 21-6-2009(5): Bad choice of keyword. The main meaning for this character is こま a piece in the game of   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/将棋">将棋</a>   (Japanese chess). But if you use that, be careful, you&#039;ll have to change   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/棋">棋</a>   <a href="../1763">chess piece</a> <span class="index">(#1763 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/棋">棋</a>)</span> which is another poor choice of keyword (it refers to strategy games in general not physical pieces). Sometimes it feels like Heisig is trying to be confusing on purpose. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lisbet">lisbet</a>] 23-12-2011(4): The new My Little <strong>Ponies</strong> show is all about magic <em>horses</em> who utter cute catch <em>phrases</em>.
