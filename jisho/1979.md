## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 2-6-2010(35): The extremely efficient (military veteran) wet-nurse keeps track of which infant has been <strong>SUCKLE</strong>d already by marking each <em>MOUTH</em> with a <em>DOG-TAG</em>. (Cf. <a href="../689">suck</a> (#689 吸)).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Henkka">Henkka</a>] 14-2-2011(17): This mom of a dozen babies put <em>dog tags</em> on the ones whose <em>mouthes</em> she had already allowed to <strong>suckle</strong> her.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 23-3-2010(14): The <em>mouth</em> of an <em>offspring</em> <strong>suckles</strong>. <a href="midori://search?text=哺乳・ほにゅう">哺乳・ほにゅう</a> lactation, suckling.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 7-11-2011(7): 哺乳類 , 哺乳動物 , 哺乳 =ほ乳, 哺育 =保育 <a href="../3027">suckle</a> (#3027 哺), ホ( 甫 ) ... Parts: 口 , 甫 <a href="../2097">offspring</a> (#2097 甫) ... Note: Overly clever keyword<strong> Suckle</strong> since it is only used for the word for mammal. (&#039;Nursing&#039; is now written 保育 .) ... Story: The only pets you put <em>dog tags</em> on are Mammals, who are called <strong>Mammals</strong> because they use mouth on mammaries.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 23-3-2011(6): The scaredy-cat soldier puts his <em>dog tags</em> in his <em>mouth</em> and<strong> suckle</strong>s them nervously. It sounds like he&#039;s a <strong>suckling</strong> infant.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 25-3-2011(1): Changing to <strong>lactate</strong> so I can keep it separate from <a href="../689">suck</a> (#689 吸) and <a href="../2193">suckling infant</a> (#2193 嬰). Female mammals only <strong>lactate</strong> after they have <em>off-spring</em> with <em>mouths</em> to drink the milk. Otherwise it would just go to waste.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Norman">Norman</a>] 20-2-2013(): All of the babies in the nursery always have their MOUTHS wide-open, wanting to<strong> SUCKLE</strong> milk. DOG TAGS help the nurses keep track on whose turn is next.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 1-9-2012(): New keyword: MAMMAL. Mammals suck milk with their MOUTHS from their mother&#039;s nipples. Then, the mother cover her nipples with DOG TAGS . 哺乳類 [ほにゅうるい] mammal.
