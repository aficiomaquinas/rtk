## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 5-10-2007(206): It is with the <em>halberd</em> he holds that the <em>taskmaster</em> exerts his <em>power</em> over those actually performing the<strong> task</strong>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 12-5-2007(122): So many video games have a &quot;boss&quot; stage you must pass in order to advance to the next level. Here, your<strong> task</strong> is to use your <em>halberd</em> to beat the <em>taskmaster</em> with the huge, bulging <em>muscles</em>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 20-12-2007(31): The most <em>powerful<strong> task</strong>master</em> knows how to multi-<strong>task</strong>. Here he&#039;s given himself the impossible<strong> task</strong> of <em>halberd</em> sparring with one arm, and <em>muscle</em> building with the other - and he&#039;s succeeding! 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb">elmaestrokgb</a>] 28-6-2009(21): A first RPG<strong> task</strong>--not even a full quest, just a<strong> task</strong> some random dude gives you (you always have to start off with some stupid weapon and go kill some other random dude, for no reason). Here, take this <em>halberd</em> I happen to have lying around. Now go kill the <em>taskmaster</em> and his hired-<em>muscle</em> UNDERling. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 27-8-2010(14): Your<strong> task</strong> is: take the <em>halberd</em> from the huge <em>taskmaster</em> with all the bulging <em>muscles</em>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peterlasky">peterlasky</a>] 24-7-2009(12): The <em>taskmaster</em> uses his <em>halbred</em> and his <em>muscles</em> to do the<strong> task</strong>. . . . . . . . (and it&#039;s about friggin&#039; time, since he&#039;s been hanging around for the last 900 Kanji doing everything but his stupid<strong> task</strong>). 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 20-9-2008(7): <em>Mao Zedong</em> had the <em>power</em> to make even a <em>taskmaster</em> do<strong> task</strong>s. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asriel">Asriel</a>] 7-4-2009(6): Your next<strong> task</strong> is to use this <em>halberd</em> to over<em>power</em> the <em>taskmaster</em> in his own game. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/desmidus">desmidus</a>] 5-3-2008(5): Your<strong> task</strong>, if you choose to accept it, is to take this halberd, sneak into Hitler&#039;s bunker, and impale him with all the power you can muster! 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 4-10-2006(5): The<strong> task</strong> that all <em>Swiss guards</em> want is to be bodyguard to the <em>taskmaster</em> (the Pope) and use their <em>muscle power</em> to keep him safe. It&#039;s a gift that<strong> task</strong> actually contains <em>taskmaster</em>!
