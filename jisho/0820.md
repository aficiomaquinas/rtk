## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 4-9-2007(274): Think of a really loud and annoying baby, you want to<strong> abandon</strong> it but it keeps coming back...so you take of your belt by the buckle, and buckle the baby to a tree!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 11-4-2007(74): As in <a href="../415">sash</a> (#415 帯), I treat the <em>one</em> <em>mountain</em> in the middle to mean Mt. Fuji (Japan&#039;s ichiban mountain). Now we see an <em>infant</em> being<strong> abandon</strong>ed on top of <em>Mt. Fuji</em> well above the <em>tree</em> line to die of exposure.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikedough2">mikedough2</a>] 8-11-2007(58): A terrible image of an<strong> abandon</strong>ed <em>infant</em>. Here he is in his little car seat <em>buckled</em> to a <em>tree</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 14-12-2008(27): <strong>Note</strong>: This Kanji does not contain 山 (mountain) as part of its radicals, it can rather be broken down to 木 厶 凵 亠 一 . Hence, it would be best to avoid using mountain in your story. <strong>Story</strong>: An inhumane way to<strong> abandon</strong> an <em>infant</em> is to <em>buckle</em> him to a <em>tree</em>...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 7-6-2009(14): The<strong> abandon</strong>ned <em>infant</em> was <em>buckled</em> to a <em>tree</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 17-1-2006(14): An<strong> abandon</strong>ed infant is buckled on top of a tree. Use the image of a harness and in particular the shoulder straps (such as when you want to buckle up an infant safely into a car) to avoid confusing the buckle with a sash or belt. Note the play on words with “buckle up”. The parents who<strong> abandon</strong>ed the infant on the side of the road buckled him up with the same harness that came from the car.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 15-4-2007(11): The <em>infant</em> is a baby in a <em>top hat</em> - the hat is so large all you can see is the baby&#039;s elbow sticking out from under it.<strong> Abandon</strong> the baby by <em>buckling</em> him to the top of a <em>tree</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lizzie">Lizzie</a>] 22-10-2008(6): I just found an<strong> abandon</strong> infant. The poor one was tied to a tree with a sash.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 9-3-2010(5): &quot;<strong>Abandon</strong> hope, all ye who enter here&quot; says the sign at the gates of hell in Dante&#039;s Inferno. Nearby wail 31<strong> abandon</strong>ed <em>infants</em> in car seats <em>buckled</em> to a <em>tree</em>. (strokes: The infants hover above the buckle)... (<strong>infant</strong> = <em>top hat</em> + <em>elbow</em>; the compressed, upside down and backwards form of <strong>child</strong>)... 廃棄 [はいき] disposal, scrap <a href="midori://search?text=、棄権者">、棄権者</a> [きけんしゃ] non-voter.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Vinnike">Vinnike</a>] 15-11-2012(3): In Sparta, when they &quot;ABANDONED&quot; an INFANT they deemed too weak, they BELTED it to a TREE in the woods so it wouldn&#039;t come crawling home.
