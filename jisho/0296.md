## Heisig story:

In the <b>summer</b>, fatigued by the heat, your <i>head</i> hangs down nearly as far as your <i>walking legs</i>, or rather, your &quot;dragging legs.&quot; Note how the <i>walking legs</i> (instead of &quot;animal legs&quot;) are the only thing that distinguishes this character from that for <i>page</i> (Frame 64).

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Birdsong">Birdsong</a>] 8-5-2007(172): In<strong> SUMMER</strong> you are hot from the top of your <em>head</em> down to your <em>walking legs</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rachels">rachels</a>] 28-7-2008(114): <em>One</em> <em>drop</em> of sweat runs into my <em>eye</em>, when I go <em>walking</em> on a hot<strong> summer</strong> day.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ouroborosatx">ouroborosatx</a>] 27-5-2008(94): I personally think it was too confusing to try and use <em>head</em> as the primitive. (How am I supposed to remember that the <em>animal legs</em> are replaced with <em>walking legs</em> instead of <em>human legs</em>?) Rather, I think have the image of a hot<strong> summer</strong> and you want to keep <em>oneself</em> under a <em>ceiling</em> not out <em>jogging</em> around.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 15-8-2011(33): Tip:Don&#039;t use Head/Page( 頁 ) as a primitive, or it will just screw up. 頁 is used hundreds of times as primitive, and <em>always</em> needs the animal legs. Repetition makes RTK work. Little changes make life hard ... The smell of sweat in<strong> Summer</strong> rises to the <em>ceiling</em>, leading you to take your 自 <em>nose</em> out on 夂<em>walking legs</em> for fresh cool air. Remember a set with 冬 <a href="../427">winter</a> (#427 冬) where the sweat (<em>two drops</em> in fact), has fallen down and frozen below those same <em>walking legs</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/whistler11">whistler11</a>] 22-4-2006(14): The heat of<strong> summer</strong> is so powerful, it swells your <em>head</em> so big, you need a bigger set of <em>walking legs</em> to hold it up.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jaunty">Jaunty</a>] 16-6-2009(12): During<strong> summer</strong> your homework <em>pages</em> grow <em>walking legs</em> and run away - yay!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop">richcoop</a>] 5-10-2008(9): In the<strong> summer</strong> when your HEAD gets hot, use your WALKING LEGS to get in the shade.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sevenhelmets">Sevenhelmets</a>] 10-6-2008(8): <strong>Summer</strong> is the best time to get <em>walking legs</em>, instead of being stuck <em>reading pages</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/delenir">delenir</a>] 27-5-2009(7): In the<strong> summer</strong>, you&#039;ll see many hot (summer) girls, good-looking from their HEAD to their WALKING LEGS.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ueshiba">ueshiba</a>] 6-5-2009(6): In the<strong> SUMMER</strong> all you see is <strong>1000</strong> gorgeous girl <strong>LEGS</strong>!!
