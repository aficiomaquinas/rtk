With that sense, you see some poor man who has been stung by a <em>scorpion</em>, so you extract the blood and <strong>make bandages</strong> out of your <em>banner</em> to <strong>administer first-aid</strong> to him. The you take the man to an hospital and give him<strong> alms</strong> to pay for the cure.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 17-12-2008(7): This kanji actually means <strong>to apply bandages</strong>. I took the BANNER and wrapped it around wounded SCORPION from mortal kombat as though I was <strong>applying bandages</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abdul">abdul</a>] 6-4-2011(5): El componente <em>estandarte</em> muestra una bandera recostada moviéndose en dirección del viento.

I.e., 也 means <em>creeps-inducing creepy-crawly critters</em>. De Roo extends it to represent social outcasts like &quot;lepers&quot; and other sufferers of &quot;contagious diseases&quot;. Story: these are <strong>ALMS</strong> delivered to a leper colony that is clearly marked off by <em>BANNER</em>s featuring a <em>SCORPION</em> (symbol for &quot;contagious disease&quot;).
