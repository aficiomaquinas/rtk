## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 23-7-2009(56): If I <em>recline</em> back, I can pull my <em>bow</em> open a <em>little</em><strong> more and more</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 13-8-2009(17): <strong>More and more</strong> <em>bows</em> were made to kill people, until they were <em>laid down</em> for better <em>small</em>er guns.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 30-10-2007(15): The <em>bow</em> dug<strong> more and more</strong> into the <em>small</em> of his back as he <em>reclined</em> on it. Will someone please tell the idiot to get up?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 24-4-2007(9): <em>Little</em> Clark Kent, who was found <em>reclining</em> in his spaceship as a baby, grew<strong> more and more</strong> stronger over the years, and found he could fly as fast as an arrow shot by a <em>bow</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Corodon">Corodon</a>] 10-12-2011(7): <strong>More and more</strong> archers shoot their <em>bow</em>s while <em>reclining</em> a <em>little</em>. It&#039;s a very popular stance.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 28-7-2009(7): A visitor from northern France came to the house of a celebrated <em>kyudo</em> (traditional Japanese archery) champion, bringing gifts of food that were &quot;protected <a href="../v4/905">appellation</a> (#905 称) of origin&quot;, such as Roquefort cheese and wine of Champagne. The archer <em>reclined</em> on his deck chair and ate and drank the <em>small</em> amount of delicious regional produce he was brought. But he was greedy, and demanded<strong> more and more</strong>, even though there was none. But he aimed his <em>bow</em> at the visitor and insisted he bring him<strong> more and more</strong>!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 30-5-2007(7): &quot;<strong>More and more</strong>&quot; could suggest greed. Being greedy might tempt one to take, with a <em>bow</em>, all that life requires. That way, one could <em>recline</em> do <em>little</em> and plan how to get <strong>more and more</strong>.

As I learn <strong>more and more</strong> about Japan, I am reading back to the Yayoi period, when <em>Bow</em> hunting was the norm, and <em>people reclined</em> but a <em>little</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 31-7-2010(3): Superman (refer back to frame <a href="../v4/905">appellation</a> (#905 称)) started learning Kyuudou, but even he had troubles with it! Hear the person teaching him tell him to stretch the bow<strong> more and more</strong>, he stretched it too little! (actually, this is a story more about myself, but whatever).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 13-6-2009(3): <em>Reclining</em> on the ground, I tell my servant to bring me<strong> more and more</strong> <em>small</em> grapes. He shoots them in my mouth with a <em>bow</em>. I&#039;m never satisfied, though, so I keep yelling at him &quot;more and more!!&quot;.
