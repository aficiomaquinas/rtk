## Heisig story:

By <i>comparing</i> apes with anthropoids, we not only discover the latter have <b>descended</b> from those progenitors educated in the higher branches, but that the very idea of seeing everything <b>descended</b> from everything else, one way or another, means that there is &quot;nothing new UNDER the <i>sun</i>.&quot;

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 21-2-2007(241): Grandparent spends all DAY COMPARING photos of their<strong> DESCENDANTS</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois">Francois</a>] 10-3-2008(114): Japanese people have compared themselves as being<strong> descendants</strong> of the sun. (Amaterasu, the sun godesss). Sun, comparing =<strong> descendants</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 16-1-2008(48): Ask a Japanese person what this kanji means, and they will surely spout 昆布 (konbu, seaweed)　and 昆虫 (konchu, insect) - but beyond that they will likely be mystified. Here&#039;s my best crack at it: imagine a grandfather watching his DESCENDENTS (grandkids) playing outside under the <em>sun</em>, silently <em>comparing</em> them, considering which of them will grow up and make him proud. Suddenly, grandma calls them in for a snack of 昆布 and for a re-application of repellent to keep the 昆虫 away.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 30-8-2007(46): My official rebuttal to racism: We&#039;re all<strong> descendants</strong> of the <em>sun</em> - there&#039;s no reason to <em>compare</em> us.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic">anthropic</a>] 25-6-2008(32): We&#039;re all <strong>descendants</strong> of chimps, get over it, don&#039;t spend all <a href="../v4/12">day</a> (#12 日) trying to <a href="../v4/447">compare</a> (#447 比) various religious fairytales.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 22-12-2007(20): In order to differenciate this kanji from <a href="../v4/449">all</a> (#449 皆), look at it as one of those drawings of human evolution. The earlier hominids appear on the left, while their<strong> descendants</strong>, the humans, go to the right. For some reason, these drawings always feature a bright <em>sun</em> on the top.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 24-4-2009(11): We spent a lovely day <em>spooning</em> under the <em>sun</em>, and created some<strong> descendants</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonny_wonny">jonny_wonny</a>] 13-5-2011(8): A <em>gay couple</em> (from gpetroce&#039;s story of <a href="../v4/447">compare</a> (#447 比)) will never have any<strong> descendants</strong>, even if they try all <em>day</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcmike2099">mcmike2099</a>] 28-6-2009(5): When talking to their<strong> descendants</strong>, grandparents will often say, &quot;Back in my <strong>DAY</strong>...&quot;, <strong>COMPARING</strong> their lives to those of their<strong> descendants</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cosby">cosby</a>] 20-7-2008(5): The japanese emperor is said to be a <em>descendant</em> of the <em>sun</em> goddess. <em>Compare</em> this story to those of other cultures and you may find he is not the only one.
