## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/happychair">happychair</a>] 14-3-2006(235): The<strong> CATALPA</strong> is the tree that bears the SPICY Indian bean (NOTE - The<strong> Catalpa</strong> is also known as the &quot;Indian Bean&quot; due to the bean pods that grow from it).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 7-8-2007(43): The <strong>caterpillar&#039;s</strong> favorite <em>tree</em> is the <strong>catalpa</strong> because it tastes <em>spicy</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tryllid">tryllid</a>] 6-10-2008(22): Tree + Spicy; The<strong> catalpa</strong> <em>tree</em> has seed pods that look like <em>spicy</em> peppers.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 21-3-2008(17): I know the <strong>Catalpa</strong> as the &quot;promise tree&quot;. A young person will cite the person he or she loves under a <strong>Catalpa</strong> <em>tree</em> to declare his or her feelings. The fact that the right primitive means both <em>spicy</em> and <em>bitter</em> illustrates the hesitance and stress that precedes the ultimate reply.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 1-6-2012(11): This kanji is barely used. Just rename the keyword to PEPPER TREE (so you don&#039;t need a story) and move on. If you do a google image search for the kanji 梓 , you&#039;ll find that this character almost exclusively refers to the female name あずさ (by the way, you will see some cute girls).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 4-9-2009(7): Somebody scratched in the bark of the<strong> catalpa</strong> <em>tree</em>: &quot;I love the <em>Spice Girls</em>!&quot; (&quot;Spice Girls&quot; is also a vivid picture for the primitive); see for a picture <a href="http://www.icteachers.co.uk/photos/photos5/catalpa.jpg">http://www.icteachers.co.uk/photos/photos5/catalpa.jpg</a>. ).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hereticalrants">hereticalrants</a>] 6-9-2010(6): I didn&#039;t know the keyword, so I did a google image search for the kanji, 梓 . It seems that this character almost exclusively refers to the female name, あずさ。 <strong>Don&#039;t bother learning the keyword for this character. It is irrelevant.</strong> Do a quick google image search.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 28-8-2006(5): <strong>Cat&#039;s on the Alps</strong> need to munch on spicy trees to keep themselves warm.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stshores24">stshores24</a>] 7-9-2008(4): Little-known fact: The leaves of the <strong>catalpa</strong> <em>tree</em> are actually quite <em>spicy</em> and good in salads. (Please don&#039;t take this as fact.) ;).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/delbertmon">delbertmon</a>] 7-1-2010(2): (happychair + URL) The<strong> CATALPA</strong> is the tree that bears the SPICY Indian bean (NOTE - The<strong> Catalpa</strong> is also known as the &quot;Indian Bean&quot; due to the bean pods that grow from it). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalpa">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalpa</a>.
