## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 27-2-2007(164): What could be more<strong> mysterious</strong> than a <em>cocoon</em> in a <em>top hat</em> trying to sneak in...? (Pimitive: <em>GANDALF</em>). 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 31-5-2007(97): The invisible man in his <em>top hat</em> and <em>cocoon</em> of white bandages is the most<strong> mysterious</strong> man in the world. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 17-2-2008(83): As romanrozhok said, this kanji has little to do with <strong>mysterious</strong>. It has the meanings [dark, abstruse, calm] (in Spanish, [moreno and recóndito]). As for the story, the union of a <em>hat</em> and a <em>coccoon</em> is obviously a fakir <em>turban</em>. India was maybe an <strong>abstruse</strong> place far away from China. Visualize a <strong>mysterious</strong>, <strong>dark-skinned</strong> fakir with a <em>turban</em> (in <strong>calming</strong> meditation) and the kanji is yours! 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 24-2-2008(30): This kanji does not really mean &quot;mysterious.&quot; In fact, out of all the words this kanji in used in, only one, an uncommon word, has that meaning faintly. If you look the kanji up, you will see that it is used in:   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/玄関">玄関</a>   【げんかん】 (n) entranceway; entry hall; (P)--and--   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/玄米">玄米</a>   【げんまい】 (n) unpolished rice; unmilled rice; brown rice; (P) (as well as other &quot;unpolished grains.&quot; (EDIT: I removed my story and am using DrJones&#039;s story). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 25-1-2008(10): Even more<strong> mysterious</strong> than this huge alien <em>cocoon</em> is the fact that it is wearing a <em>top hat</em>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 29-6-2007(10): What could be more<strong> mysterious</strong> than a <em>cocoon</em> in a <em>top hat</em> trying to sneak into the Mystery Science Theatre 3000? 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/killazys">killazys</a>] 8-10-2011(5): Very<strong> mysterious</strong>... It appears that this <em>Metapod</em> evolved into a <em>top hat</em> wearing Butterfree. Cute little holes for the antennae, I guess. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gothats">gothats</a>] 15-11-2009(5): The<strong> mysterious</strong> man wraps himself up like a cocoon, so all you can see is his top hat. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yLaguardia">yLaguardia</a>] 17-6-2012(4): First read dingomick and Dr. Jones. Now I tell you: this is Gandalf the Grey, but we&#039;ll call him <strong>Gandalf the Dark</strong>. He is a<strong> mysterious</strong> one always wearing a top hat... And one could use a metaphor to say that he is a cocoon, waiting to attain his full power and become Gandalf the White. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dusmar84">dusmar84</a>] 23-1-2010(3): The invisible man in his <em>top hat</em> and <em>cocoon</em> of white bandages is the most<strong> mysterious</strong> man in the world. <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/06aug/01107/InvisibleMan%20mage.jpg">http://library.thinkquest.org/06aug/01107/InvisibleMan%20mage.jpg</a> (thx decameron, thought this image worked well) **Primitive: <strong>Invisible man</strong>.
