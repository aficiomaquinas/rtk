## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 30-5-2006(273): You are so poor you dont know where your <em>next dish</em> will come from all you know is that you will have to<strong> steal</strong> it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 24-10-2007(62): The first thing to<strong> steal</strong> is the silverware; <em>next</em>, the <em>dishes</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 9-7-2006(34): You&#039;re at a revolving sushi restaurant with a famous thief, who&#039;s so slick he says he can<strong> steal</strong> anything without anyone noticing. OK, you say, the NEXT DISH that comes by,<strong> steal</strong> it...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 2-8-2010(25): This is pretty easy: While he&#039;s not looking, imagine<strong> steal</strong>ing food from the dish next to you!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 24-1-2011(8): The <em>next</em> thing on his list of things to<strong> steal</strong> after the <em>dishes</em> was the kitchen sink. Watch out for <a href="../357">burglar</a> (#357 賊) and <a href="../566">rob</a> (#566 奪) and <a href="../1414">crime</a> (#1414 犯). To differentiate it, think that<strong> steal</strong>ing is arbitrary (hence the kitchen sink), <a href="../566">rob</a> (#566 奪) is more deliberate (and hence the protection of the attack turkey) and <a href="../357">burglar</a> (#357 賊) is the most professional of them all (it is his full time job), so he knows when to hit (when everyone is at the fiesta).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dustin_Calgary">Dustin_Calgary</a>] 13-1-2009(7): Aladdin must<strong> STEAL</strong> his NEXT PLATE of food.

(also think about &quot;dine and dash&quot; scene from Samurai Champloo&quot;, where they eat food without paying) . :-p.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stevesayskanpai">stevesayskanpai</a>] 27-4-2009(4): Think baseball! The first base runner<strong> steal</strong>s to the next plate.
