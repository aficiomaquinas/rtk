## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(399): This is either a love scene or a murder scene that you are seeing through a<strong> window</strong>. The love scene: through the<strong> window</strong> of a house (from a distance), you see a pair of human legs, then elbows, and then some pink hearts floating up like in a cartoon. The murder scene: peering through the<strong> window</strong> of a house, you see a gruesome murder scene. Human legs dangling from a ceiling fan, an elbow sticking out of a wall, and a heart still beating on the carpet. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 21-6-2006(81): A photographer is at <em>home</em>, recovering his broken <em>human legs</em>. With nothing better to do, he is looking through the rear <strong>window</strong> with his camera (he needs to use his <em>elbow</em> to support those heavy lenses) until his <em>heart</em> begins to race as he witnesses a murder! 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 18-2-2007(67): A voyeur peeks in the<strong> window</strong> of a <em>house</em>, but all he can see is <em>legs</em>. So he <em>elbows</em> up into the<strong> window</strong> for a better view which gets his <em>heart</em> racing. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois">Francois</a>] 21-4-2008(52): When I see that<strong> window</strong> I get chills... I was in that house when my girlfriend threw me out the<strong> window</strong>. She broke my <em>legs, my elbows and my heart</em>! 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/karmatheif">karmatheif</a>] 8-7-2008(33): The top primitive is similar to <a href="../1316">hole</a> <span class="index">(#1316 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/穴">穴</a>)</span>. A<strong> window</strong> is a <a href="../1316">hole</a> <span class="index">(#1316 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/穴">穴</a>)</span> in your house that you occassionally sit next to while leaning on your ELBOW and gazing out, a picture of a lonely HEARTedness. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/feldrave">feldrave</a>] 3-11-2009(19): Remember Alice in Wonderland? She was visiting a <em>house</em> when she suddenly got so big that she had to stick her <em>legs</em> and <em>elbows</em> through the<strong> window</strong>s, which made the Queen of <em>Hearts</em> really mad. To put it in order, from top to bottom: a<strong> window</strong> is the part of the <em>house</em> through which Alice stuck her <em>legs</em> and <em>elbows</em>, making the Queen of <em>Hearts</em> mad. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sanshinboy">sanshinboy</a>] 24-1-2011(10): When i looked through my girlfriends<strong> window</strong>...i saw her legs and elbows wrapped around another man...it broke my heart. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Melamelachan">Melamelachan</a>] 18-12-2009(8): When mini-skirts first came up, my (then already quite aged) great-grandfather used to enjoy sitting in his <em>house</em> and looking out of the<strong> window</strong> at all those <em>human legs</em> that were walking past outside, his <em>heart</em> pounding. When my great-grandmother noticed this, she <em>elbowed</em> him in the ribs, of course! 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/philiphoward123">philiphoward123</a>] 3-10-2009(6): Like &quot;Howl&#039;s Moving Castle&quot;, this is a magical <em>house</em> on <em>human legs</em> that can travel around the country doing mischief or helping you prevent it. Next to the bend of its <em>elbow</em> you can see in through the<strong> window</strong> somewhat, and you spy a glimmer of red reflected from the <em>heart</em> within. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nite_run">nite_run</a>] 5-11-2007(6): What light threw yonder<strong> window</strong> breaks? Juliet walks out of her <em>home</em> on her <em>human legs</em>, and rests her <em>elbow</em>s on the balcony and listens to the <em>heart</em>felt words of Romeo.
