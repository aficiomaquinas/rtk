## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 24-3-2010(162): In Final Fantasy 4, sleeping in a tent completely<strong> heal</strong>s you and recovers all your HP and MP (and cures any <em>sickness</em> your characters may have). 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 29-2-2008(64): Sick caveman has to sleep in his pup tent. Not the cave because to humid and cold but a nice small pup tent in the sun will<strong> heal</strong> him from his cold. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 9-5-2006(35): There’s nothing like a little getting away from it all, pitching a PUP-TENT in a scenic place, kicking back, relaxing and drinking in nature’s beautiful medicine. It’s a great way to<strong> HEAL</strong> the SICKNESSes of modern life that afflict us. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 18-6-2009(29): The <em>sick caveman</em> asks gods to<strong> heal</strong> him (from a hangover) and sets a <em>sacred bonfire</em> in his cave. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Delina">Delina</a>] 9-2-2009(21): On the battlefield, the only place to<strong> heal</strong> from your <em>sickness</em> is inside the medic&#039;s <em>pup tent</em>. Think of M.A.S.H. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jreaves">jreaves</a>] 18-7-2007(13): To avoid spreading his sickness to the other cave dwellers, caveman sleeps outside the cave in a pup tent while he is<strong> heal</strong>ing. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 13-8-2007(10): Picture the colorful animation for a powerful<strong> heal</strong> spell in one of the recent MMORPG&#039;s. Something like a <em>pup tent</em> descends from the heavens and the target of the<strong> heal</strong> spell is stuck in it for the duration of the spell (looking very much like a helpless little pup! Think of it as the drawback of the spell, which would otherwise be too convenient). See my story for <a href="../2037">healing</a> <span class="index">(#2037 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/癒">癒</a>)</span> to sort out the similar keywords (both stories are set within a MMORPG setting which helps). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 20-5-2010(6): You better<strong> HEAL</strong> from this <em>SICKNESS</em> soon, because I&#039;m all out of <em>SACRIFICIAL FUEL</em> (尞) now. I used it all in offerings for your speedy recovery! (See my story for <em>SACRIFICIAL FUEL</em> <a href="../23582">Unicode-0x5c1e</a> <span class="index">(#23582 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/尞">尞</a>)</span>). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ShinseiJiyuu">ShinseiJiyuu</a>] 4-11-2012(3): In Dark Souls, the sacred bonfires will<strong> heal</strong> you to full<strong> heal</strong>th, including any sickness that ails you.
