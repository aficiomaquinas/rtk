## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 14-6-2006(282): Selling<strong> WHOLESALE</strong> HORSES over the internet had to be STOPPED because the cost of STAMPS was too much.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 14-1-2008(62): If you need <em>horseshoes</em> (shoes that fit your <em>horse</em>&#039;s <em>footprint</em>), buy them at the<strong> wholesale</strong> shop. They lick and paste <em>stamps</em> in your membership card so you can get free merchandise later.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 5-5-2009(28): A horse as a<strong> wholesale</strong>r: It <em>stamps</em> every contract with its <em>horse-footprint</em> (horseshoe) since it obviously can&#039;t write with its hooves.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SuzuBell">SuzuBell</a>] 18-2-2011(14): <strong>Wholesale</strong> refers to the sale of goods in quantity to retailers for resale. When this kanji was invented, large loads of goods needed to be transported by <em>horses</em> who left steep <em>footprints</em> because of the weight they carried. The<strong> wholesale</strong> goods needed a special <em>stamp</em> to indicate that they were legal for resale. See <a href="../1398">honorable</a> (#1398 御).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 30-4-2007(13): At Costco you can buy horses<strong> wholesale</strong>. Just remember that they charge you by the size of the <em>horse&#039;s footprint</em>, and you need to bring your own <em>stamps</em> for delivery.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SwiftyFrisco">SwiftyFrisco</a>] 17-7-2010(6): <strong>Wholesale</strong> livestock are always <strong>branded</strong> (a kind of stamp) with their owners mark for ease of identification. Here a rather unimaginative <strong>horse</strong> seller uses a <strong>horseshoe</strong> to brand his<strong>horses</strong> with.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cheesemaster64">Cheesemaster64</a>] 14-3-2009(4): Sam&#039;s club is readying up its <em>horses</em> for<strong> wholesale</strong>. They are on long conveyor belt which stops in front of a HUGE machine which stamps the horse. Next horse, stop, stamp, repeat.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Corodon">Corodon</a>] 4-11-2011(3): At <em>noon</em>, they <em>stop</em> selling fish in Japanese markets at full price and <em>stamp</em> it<strong> wholesale</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shuusaku">shuusaku</a>] 17-1-2010(2): At the<strong> WHOLESALE</strong>, you can use your HORSE and its FOOTPRINT instead of the regular STAMP. strange as it might seems, it is legal and totally accepted.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 13-12-2009(2): When buying from the horse<strong> wholesale</strong>r, proof of purchase is shown by way of a <em>horse shoe</em> design <em>stamp</em>.
