heisig: "Turn this character 45 degrees either way and you have the x used for the Roman numeral <b>ten</b>. As a primitive, this character sometimes keeps its meaning of ten and sometimes signifies NEEDLE, this latter derived from the kanji for NEEDLE 針 (FRAME 274 針). Since the primitive is used in the kanji itself, there is no need to worry about confusing the two. In fact, we shall be following this procedure regularly. SIMPLE  You can use the Roman character for ten (rotated 45 degrees)."
