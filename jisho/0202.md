heisig: "One often thinks of books as &quot;good <i>companions</i>,&quot; but here it is the <b>shelf</b> we store them on that is the <i>companion</i>. The reasons should be obvious: it is made of the same stuff, <i>wood</i>, and spends a lot more time with them than we do! Here again, be careful not to let the rationality of the explanation get in the way before you turn it into a proper story."
