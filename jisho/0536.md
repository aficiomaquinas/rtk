## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 31-5-2007(194): When the <em>taskmaster</em> found his favorite <em>white compas</em> damaged by <em>water</em>, he became the most<strong> violent</strong> <em>taskmaster</em> there ever was.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alex12345">alex12345</a>] 25-7-2008(89): Overnight the slave got<strong> Violent</strong> and was Set Free. Overnight....Set Free.

(Thanks to KANJI for the (true) story about Bull Connor and the protests).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 31-8-2007(31): There&#039;s a theory as to why <em>Hitler</em> became so<strong> violent</strong> - basically all he lived on for weeks at a time in prison was <em>drops of water</em> - literally, just <em>drops</em> at a time, supplemented by copious amounts of <em>cocaine</em> (see <a href="../37">white</a> (#37 白)) , which he snorted off the top of a <em>compass</em> blade. True story, saw it on the <em>Hitle</em>-- I mean History Channel.
