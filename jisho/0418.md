## Koohii stories:

He only wears the sword because he&#039;s part of the <em>bushi</em><strong> SYSTEM</strong>. Actually, he studies ikebana, shodo, and zen. Imagine him sitting cross-legged in a Zen temple (a very <em>Special</em> Zen temple). The master asks him if a dog has buddha nature and, shifting the swords in his belt, he calmly replies, &quot;Moo!&quot;.
