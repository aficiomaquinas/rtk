## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 17-3-2008(215): Anyone living in Japan knows that train<strong> station</strong>s play little melodies when the train is about to arrive. In Ye Olden Days, when <em>horses</em> and carriages were used for transport, the carriage driver would play a little melody on his <em>shakuhachi</em> to let the passengers know the carriage was arriving at the next<strong> station</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jreaves">jreaves</a>] 23-7-2007(160): This reminds me of those infamous Mexican porn movies in which shakuhachi is performed on a horse. Here the deed is being done at a train<strong> station</strong>. As the passengers get off, so does the horse.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 20-7-2007(27): I got off at the<strong> station</strong> and saw a <em>trojan horse</em> getting a <em>shakuhachi</em> (blowjob).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/melchan">melchan</a>] 28-7-2009(11): In this train line the wagons are <em>trojan horses</em> and at each<strong> station</strong> the driver plays a little melody on his <em>shakuhachi</em> to let the passengers know they arrived at the next<strong> station</strong>. [thanks rtkrtk].

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 28-1-2008(11): A homeless horse playing the flute at the<strong> station</strong> to make a dime.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tristanthorn">tristanthorn</a>] 18-3-2009(9): At the souvenir shop at the Troy train<strong> station</strong>, I bought a <em>trojan horse</em> model and a <em>shakuhachi</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 3-7-2009(5): Tokyo<strong> station</strong> (eki) is probably the most famous<strong> station</strong> in Japan, for obvious reasons. But it used to be famous for more nefarious reasons - in the Edo period, shamed geishas were forced to perform <em>shakuhachis</em> on their lords and even their lords&#039; <em>horses</em> prior to seppoku. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Metro_Marunouchi_Line#Shoppori_Geisha_History">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Metro_Marunouchi_Line#Shoppori_Geisha_History</a>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samesong">samesong</a>] 19-10-2008(5): This isn&#039;t any regular train<strong> station</strong>, it&#039;s the <em>shakuhachi</em><strong> station</strong> - instead of trains, there are huge <em>trojan horses</em> that you climb into. As the <em>trojan horse</em> makes its way out of the<strong> station</strong> and onto the train tracks, a woman comes out and gives you a <em>shakuhachi</em> during the entirety of the ride.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 26-10-2005(4): There&#039;s a train at the<strong> station</strong> which has a whole bunch of horsepower and uses one of those shaku flutes as its smokestack.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/martie">martie</a>] 28-9-2010(2): You are in your wagon led by a <em>TEAM OF HORSES</em> and heading to the<strong> STATION</strong> while getting a <em>SHAKUHACHI</em>.
