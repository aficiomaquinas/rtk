7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 24-4-2010(6): <strong>[100% FAKE ETYMOLOGY]</strong> The expression &quot;old <strong>CHESTNUT</strong>&quot;, meaning a tired, too-often-told story or cliché, comes from a staple of <em>old WESTERN</em>s: whenever there was a need to hang someone, the posse invariably picked &quot;that ol&#039;<strong> CHESTNUT</strong> <em>TREE</em>&quot; right outside of town. Hence, &quot;old <strong>CHESTNUT</strong>&quot; became synonymous with a tired, worn-out cliché. (<a href="http://snipurl.com/chestnut">http://snipurl.com/chestnut</a>) <strong>[100% FAKE ETYMOLOGY]</strong>.
