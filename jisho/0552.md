heisig: "Above, an <i>eye</i> and a <i>fishhook</i>,&nbsp;and below the primitive for <i>little</i>. Although apparently the simplest of these first six kanji, when you begin to work on its plot and story you will soon find out that the number of strokes and visual complexity of a kanji does not make it easier or harder to remember. It is the primitives you have to work that are the critical factor, as in this case where the meaning of the key word is so seemingly distant from the elements. Remember, you can always break larger elements down (<i>eye of a needle</i> into <i>eye</i> and <i>fishhook</i>) if you think it helps."

## Heisig story:

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 6-4-2008(206): In Japanese this is KEN, as in Barbie&#039;s boyfriend. He has lovely blue <em>eyes,</em> a girlfriend who is as thin as a <em>straightened out fish hook</em>. But, down where it counts, he has very <em>little</em> to show...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 9-1-2007(177): After sticking a <em>fishhook</em> in your <em>eye</em>, the yakuza boss probably has <em>little</em> more to do to convince you to move to a different<strong> prefecture</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kresobilan">kresobilan</a>] 5-3-2008(81): <em>Smaller</em> administrative units, <em>hooked</em> together by a (Sauron&#039;s) central <em>eye</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 25-4-2006(53): Contradictory to what Heisig says, there is no eye of a needle in this picture, because that would be the top part of 直 . Instead, there is the eye of a fishhook. I will not hazard a guess as to what lives in such a place, but in fact the eye of a fishhook - as it has well-defined borders - makes a small<strong> prefecture</strong> of its own.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 22-6-2008(48): <em>Eye</em> (I) live in a <em>small</em> <strong>prefecture</strong> full of <em>hook</em>ers.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 16-1-2011(38): Each<strong> prefecture</strong> is <em>eye</em>-catching (has its own little &quot;<em>hook</em>&quot;) in its own way, even if the attraction is just a <em>small</em> one. 県 (けん) :<strong> prefecture</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/WithLoveFromExIA">WithLoveFromExIA</a>] 17-11-2008(18): For this kanji, I picture a draconian government. Picture first the all seeing <em>eye</em> in the sky. Next see the giant <em>fishhook</em> that takes free-thinking people The Man disapproves of away. Finally see the <em>little</em> committee of people in an underground base who run the system, having the entire<strong> prefecture</strong> following their every wish.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narafan">narafan</a>] 18-7-2007(18): Looking through the <strong>eye of a needle</strong> one can see the <strong>little</strong><strong> prefecture</strong>s marked on the Japanese map.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 19-6-2009(14): From Death Note (thanks swiftman)- By broadcasting in only one area, they figured out what<strong> prefecture</strong> Kira was in. Once he <em>eye</em>d the man he believed to be <em>L</em>, he wasted <em>little</em> time before killing him.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeelonghellswan">thegeelonghellswan</a>] 6-7-2008(9): There is a little<strong> prefecture</strong> in Japan which is well known for selling eyes on little fish hooks as delicacies.
