## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet">sweetneet</a>] 27-9-2006(166): You can&#039;t expect weight loss to happen overnight. You should limit <em>going</em> to the <em>scale</em> to weigh yourself to once a day or once a week, in order to observe the anticipated weight loss<strong> gradually</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/slats70">slats70</a>] 10-1-2009(79): I set up a <em>column</em> chart next to my <em>scales</em> so I could record my weight<strong> gradually</strong> changing.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 28-11-2007(26): Remember the urban legend of the ARMY COLUMN that weighed TOO MUCH with their rythmic marching that the bridge collapsed? Now ARMY COLUMNS will march<strong> GRADUALLY</strong> across so that they do not bear TOO MUCH on the bridge.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-9-2007(21): <em>Flash</em> didn&#039;t get fat overnight. He <strong>gradually</strong> added a pound on the <em>scale</em> here and there until finally he weighed <em>too much</em> to fit into his snazzy red costume. (Credit: CharleyGarrett).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scout">scout</a>] 11-2-2008(12): Ever since he&#039;s stopped doing Tours, <em>Lance</em> has been<strong> gradually</strong> gaining weight. See him cringe as he steps on a <em>scale</em> and sees it<strong> gradually</strong> go up!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 11-12-2006(11): <em>Flash</em> didn&#039;t get so overweight overnight. He just <strong>gradually</strong> add a pound here and there until finally he weighed <em>too much</em> to fit into his snazzy red costume.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 7-3-2008(9): When Kanji.Koohii got live, there were almost no user base. The number of users was <em>too little</em>. But later, people have been<strong> gradually</strong> <em>going</em> to this place over time, and now we have <em>too much</em>! (quite a coincidence that for<strong> gradually</strong> we have a primitive that goes from <em>too little</em> to <em>too much</em>).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BobDG">BobDG</a>] 15-12-2010(8): Going<strong> gradually</strong> takes too much time.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zz_alex_zz">zz_alex_zz</a>] 8-5-2008(8): These historical columns have been <strong>gradually</strong> sinking for years. Scientists decided to look into the problem. They chipped a tiny piece off one of the <em>column</em>s and placed the chip on some <em>scales</em>. It turns out that the <em>columns</em> <em>weigh too much</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vengeorgeb">vengeorgeb</a>] 1-5-2009(5): Weight loss occurs<strong> gradually</strong> (if you are working out of course). You should avoid <em>going</em> to the <em>scale</em> everyday since you wouldn&#039;t notice much change.
