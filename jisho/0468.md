## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 8-1-2006(271): Japanese<strong> cook</strong>ing sometimes <em>lacks</em> <em>fire</em>, e.g., sashimi.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Deonnn">Deonnn</a>] 29-11-2007(63): This character shows the difference between a <strong>cook</strong> and a chef: a chef prepares food with passion and love; a <strong>cook</strong> only stands there with a pan over a <em>fire</em>, with no passion and just <em>yawning</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lizzie">Lizzie</a>] 21-6-2008(26): How can you<strong> cook</strong> something when you lack fire?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 9-12-2006(26): This is the first kanji for rice<strong> cook</strong>er ( 炊飯器 ). The reason they came up with that device is the sheer amount of incidents of people&#039;s morning rice going up in flames while they were yawning, trying to keep awake.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 18-10-2005(17): Tip : if you have seen Hayao Miyazaki &#039;s animated movie &quot;Howl&#039;s moving castle&quot; (Le Château Ambulant), you may use the image of the flame demon Calcifer for the fire primitive. Somewhere in the first part of the movie, after Sophie arrives at the castle, she tries to<strong> cook</strong> some ham with the help of <em>Calcifer (the flame demon)</em> but he just complains and <em>yawns</em>!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johngwk">johngwk</a>] 6-7-2010(13): One cannot<strong> cook</strong> when the <em>fire</em> is <em>lacking</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skellyfish">skellyfish</a>] 16-12-2008(9): Think of The Sims - when your characters first try to<strong> COOK</strong>, they always start a FIRE because they LACK<strong> cook</strong>ing skill points. It&#039;s really annoying, but it&#039;s also funny to watch them freaking out.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gopineapples">gopineapples</a>] 28-5-2009(7): You can<strong> cook</strong> anywhere, as long as FIRE isnt LACKing.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vxnine">vxnine</a>] 30-9-2008(6): <em>Lack</em> of sleep (indicated by the <em>yawning</em>) while<strong> cook</strong>ing can lead to a house <em>fire</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mtb812">mtb812</a>] 11-12-2012(2): A<strong> cook</strong> has to make the<strong> cook</strong>ing <em>fire</em> while still <em>yawning</em>.
