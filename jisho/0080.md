heisig: "To the left we have the primitive for a <i>shellfish</i>, and to the right the kanji we just learned for <i>possess</i>. Keep the connotation of the last frame for the word <i>possess</i>, and now expand your image of <i>shells</i> to include the ancient value they had as money (a usage that will come in very helpful later on). Now one who is <i>possessed</i> by <i>shells</i> is likely to abandon any higher principles to acquire more and more wealth. These are the easiest ones to <b>bribe</b> with a few extra <i>shells</i>."
