heisig: "<i>Tongue</i> . . . <i>nose</i> . . . <i>heart</i>. The sense of <i>breath</i> from the last frame should not be used; it could lead you to put only the <i>nose</i> over the <i>heart</i> and leave the <i>tongue</i> off to one side."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 1-3-2007(274): <strong>Recess</strong> to me is a school break. At<strong> recess</strong> some kiddies are comparing their latest body piercings. <em>Tongues</em> and <em>noses</em> are nothing special. The new cool is to have your <em>heart</em> done! 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/strugglebunny">strugglebunny</a>] 17-11-2008(104): At<strong> recess</strong>, little boys stick their <em>tongues</em> out and pick their <em>noses</em> while little girls draw <em>hearts</em> on the ground with chalk. It&#039;s winter now, so any <em>tongues</em> --left-- out for too long will freeze. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 13-4-2008(96): Ah<strong> recess</strong>; <em>tongues</em> slandering, <em>noses</em> being turned up, and beneath it all, young <em>hearts</em> being broken. Dominant in playgrounds is the noise of <em>tongues</em>, which helps me remember that in this kanji <em>tongue</em> comes first. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johan">Johan</a>] 13-4-2006(52): The<strong> recess</strong> is a remote place for meditation. You sit meditating with other monks, breathing though your nose, holding your tongue (keeping quiet), and finding peace in your heart. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 2-6-2011(17): At<strong> recess</strong>...tongues flapping , noses running, hearts racing. wheeee!   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/休憩">休憩</a>  　きゅうけい　Imagine the skinny teacher from The Simpsons saying &quot;we&#039;re gonna have<strong> recess</strong> now children, nnnkay&quot;. けい. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/neuviemep">neuviemep</a>] 22-6-2011(15): This actually means <strong>rest, relax</strong>. Having run a marathon, you stop to rest, your <em>tongue</em> sticking out, panting heavily through the nose as well as the mouth (partially obstructed by the dangling tongue), your <em>heart</em> beating wildly. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/firion1234">firion1234</a>] 15-1-2010(14): &quot;I can touch my <em>TONGUE</em> to my <em>NOSE</em>, cross my <em>HEART</em>!&quot; cried the boy, to which the bully rejoined, &quot;fine! prove it at <strong>RECESS</strong>!&quot;. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 18-6-2009(11): At<strong> recess</strong> the boy stuck out his <em>tongue</em> at her, punched her in the <em>nose</em> and broke her <em>heart</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kashikoi">kashikoi</a>] 21-1-2009(7): I imagine the rapidly beating hearts of those little overactive kids sticking out their tongues and picking their noses during<strong> recess</strong>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 26-10-2007(6): At<strong> recess</strong> the schoolkids are all comparing their latest body art: pierced <em>tongues</em> and <em>noses</em>, and for that retro look, <em>heart</em> tattoos. (I   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/心">心</a>   Harry Potter). (riffing off synewave).
