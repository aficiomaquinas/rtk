heisig: "The <b>stocks</b> bought and sold on the market by the tens of millions each day get their name from a comparison to a healthy <i>tree</i>, in which one takes &quot;<b>stock</b>&quot; in the hopes that it will grow and produce more and more <i>trees</i> like itself. Usually good <b>stocks</b> are referred to as &quot;blue chip,&quot; but here we are asked to associate the key word with the color <i>vermilion</i>, perhaps because one can assess the value of a tree from the color of its autumn leaves."

## Heisig story:

The <b>stocks</b> bought and sold on the market by the tens of millions each day get their name from a comparison to a healthy <i>tree</i>, in which one takes &quot;<b>stock</b>&quot; in the hopes that it will grow and produce more and more <i>trees</i> like itself. Usually good <b>stocks</b> are referred to as &quot;blue chip,&quot; but here we are asked to associate the key word with the color <i>vermilion</i>, perhaps because one can assess the value of a tree from the color of its autumn leaves.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cellophane">cellophane</a>] 12-10-2007(306): Which <em>tree</em> would you buy<strong> stocks</strong> in - the healthy one on the left, or the one with only one <em>vermilion</em> leaf left on the right?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 2-3-2007(145): Ideally, one buys<strong> stocks</strong> when a company is young, &quot;green,&quot; and rapidly growing -- then sells them just before the last vermillion leaf falls off, and a period of dormancy or limited growth begins.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shimouma">shimouma</a>] 27-3-2008(40): I have a hot tip for you. Buy<strong> stocks</strong> in a company called &quot;Tree and Vermillion Ltd&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CarlKenner">CarlKenner</a>] 7-7-2007(25): Don&#039;t think of the <strong>stock</strong>-market. Instead imagine the <em>wood</em>en medieval<strong> stocks</strong> used to hold a prisoner&#039;s head and hands between two blocks of <em>wood</em>. The <em>wood</em> in this case is <em>vermilion</em> coloured, as it often was. Imagine <strong>SHOO</strong>ING away the guards and blowing the<strong> stocks</strong> open with a big &quot;<strong>kaboo</strong>m&quot; sound. (ON reading SHU, Kun reading kabu).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oRis1024">oRis1024</a>] 24-7-2008(21): You buy<strong> stocks</strong> when they&#039;re new and green like a <em>normal tree</em> and sell it when it&#039;s <em>vermillion-HOT</em> and pricy.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dani385">dani385</a>] 4-10-2009(17): I bought<strong> stocks</strong> in trees worth o-ver-a-million.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 7-4-2012(12): Invest in<strong> stocks</strong> that grow like <em>trees</em>; sell those that drop like <em>vermillion</em> leaves (or your portfolio will turn such a hue).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 13-9-2009(8): Buy<strong> stocks</strong> when they&#039;re young, green and growing in value like a small <em>tree</em>. Sell them when the company inevitably stagnates and quarterly profits drop to the point where the accountant replace their black pens with <em>vermilion</em> ones (i.e. &quot;in the red&quot;). You see this kanji everywhere in Japan, usually in brackets on the backs of trucks （ 株 ） indicating the status of the company as a limited liability company (this is an abbreviation of 株式会社 ： かぶしきがいしゃ = Co. Ltd.).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 18-8-2007(7): I checked our<strong> stocks</strong>, all we have left are <em>tree</em>s coloured <em>vermilion</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/iNAKO">iNAKO</a>] 24-3-2011(5): Ever since the<strong> STOCKS</strong> dropped, VERMILLIONaires have been hanging themselves from TREES.
