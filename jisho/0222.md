heisig: "The <b>stocks</b> bought and sold on the market by the tens of millions each day get their name from a comparison to a healthy <i>tree</i>, in which one takes "<b>stock</b>" in the hopes that it will grow and produce more and more <i>trees</i> like itself. Usually good <b>stocks</b> are referred to as "blue chip," but here we are asked to associate the key word with the color <i>vermilion</i>, perhaps because one can assess the value of a tree from the color of its autumn leaves."
