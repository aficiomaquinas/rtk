3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 9-1-2006(29): This one doesn&#039;t help me very much but some of my mates found it helpful: Jack&#039;s beanstalk <em>sprouted</em> up, he climbed up it and found a <em>house</em> floating in<strong> mid-air</strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 9-4-2007(19): With new <em>houses</em> <em>sprouting</em> up everwhere,<strong> mid-air</strong> collisions are becoming more common as airplanes have to avoid the new structures.

We run at each other, jump, do synchronous backflips and high-five each other in<strong> mid-air</strong>, yelling BRUSSEL SPROUT IN DA HOUSE! because I call my brother Brussel sprout because he was conceived in Brussels. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 3-5-2007(6): This can also mean &quot;space,&quot; so I imagine an experimental hydroponics hot-<em>house</em> with <em>sprouts</em> hanging in<strong> mid-air</strong> on the space shuttle.
