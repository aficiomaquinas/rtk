## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 7-11-2007(312): You&#039;re hiding from the enemy underwater in a<strong> swamp</strong>. To breathe, you have your <em>shakuhachi</em> flute poking up through the surface of the <em>water</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 27-7-2007(53): Sirens in the<strong> swamp</strong> play eerie music on their shakuhachi flutes to lure you in - you follow the enchanting music then its too late as you get trapped in the<strong> swamp</strong>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penot">penot</a>] 30-10-2008(42): &quot;Eww.. It feels and tastes like a<strong> swamp</strong>!!&quot;, my girlfriend said, after she received my 尺 <em>shakuhachi</em> &#039;<em>water</em>&#039;. // <strong>タク ze2 택 (taeg) 석 (seog)</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 8-5-2006(33): Different from <a href="../137">marsh</a> (#137 沼) in that<strong> swamp</strong> has trees. The trees are represented by shakuhachi flutes here, mystically calling the water in like Pied Piper did to rats.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 14-5-2008(24): My girlfriend doesn&#039;t want to give me <em>shakuhachi</em> in the<strong> swamp</strong>. She doesn&#039;t want to get<strong> swamp</strong> <em>water</em> all over her.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 23-10-2011(9): Bukake　(actually ぶっかけ is 打っ掛け (strike and hang) which means &quot;splash&quot;, specifically on the face.) So this works pretty well as a meme, considering the &quot;shakuhachi&quot; conotation. .

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 18-11-2009(7): If the <em>water</em> rises by one more <em>shaku</em> we&#039;ll be<strong> swamp</strong>ed. In fact this whole area will turn into a<strong> swamp</strong>! HINT: Do not confuse with <a href="../137">marsh</a> (#137 沼) 沼 . Fortunately, in both English and Japanese,<strong> swamp</strong> also suggests &quot;to be inundated with an abundance&quot;, or more accurately, &quot;an excess of something&quot;. English example: We were<strong> swamp</strong>ed with food. Japanese example: 沢山 (たくさん) = &quot;lots of&quot; i.e. &quot;swamped with a mountain of&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 31-8-2009(7): If the <em>water</em> level is up to 1 <em>shaku</em> (30.3 cm), it is still considered a<strong> swamp</strong>. Compare to <a href="../137">marsh</a> (#137 沼). Note: If you confuse<strong> swamp</strong> and marsh, then note that both <strong>swamp</strong> and shaku start with the letter S.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 17-12-2008(6): In the<strong> SWAMP</strong> WATER I got the best &quot;BROW JOB&quot; ever!!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(5): You&#039;re hiding from the enemy underwater in a <strong>swamp</strong>. To breathe, you have your <em>shakuhachi</em> flute poking up through the surface of the <em>water</em>. Too bad the enemies can hear you breathe a beautiful melody!
