## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DurablePants">DurablePants</a>] 2-8-2006(159): A<strong> fervent</strong> horse doesnt need to be whipped with a bamboo stick during a race, it will go fast by itself. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 1-12-2006(132): A<strong> fervent</strong> history otaku rebuild the the <em>Trojan Horse</em>. But since he was Japanese, he used <em>bamboo</em> instead of normal wood. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 8-12-2006(62): The <strong>fervent</strong> soldiers used <em>bamboo</em> <strong>for vents</strong> to breathe while crammed inside the <em>Trojan horse</em>. —— Using punnery to avoid confusing with <a href="../814">ardent</a> <span class="index">(#814 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/烈">烈</a>)</span>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 17-3-2008(34): Careful: <a href="../814">ardent</a> <span class="index">(#814 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/烈">烈</a>)</span>. According to WWWJDIC <a href="../814">ardent</a> <span class="index">(#814 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/烈">烈</a>)</span> seems to emphasize a fanatical or violent aspect, while<strong> fervent</strong> is more deep, serious, or kind. Story: the<strong> fervent</strong> believer in healthy vegetarian food would only feed his <em>horses</em> the finest <em>bamboo</em> shoots. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 29-10-2008(16): Imagine a guy in a horse race, the gates go down and all the horses start galloping... except for this one guy, who is sitting on a <em>trojan horse</em>, hitting it<strong> fervent</strong>ly with a <em>bamboo</em> stick but it just wont move. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 28-1-2008(7): The poor horse ran ever more<strong> fervent</strong>ly as it&#039;s master whipped it with the bamboo stick. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/drkdve">drkdve</a>] 2-5-2010(3): A<strong> FERVENT</strong> history otaku rebuilt the TROJAN HORSE to the exact dimensions of the original, only he made it entirely out of BAMBOO, ostensibly <em>fer</em> e<em>vent</em>s in Japan. [re: astridtops]. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ImaginaryJapan">ImaginaryJapan</a>] 24-1-2010(3): A<strong> fervent</strong> <em>team of horses</em> doesn&#039;t need to be whipped with a <em>bamboo</em> stick during a chariot race, they will fast by themselves. (modified from DurablePants). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 23-8-2010(2): I was so<strong> fervent</strong> to win the horse race, I took a shortcut through the bamboos. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 26-4-2009(2): This does not mean<strong> fervent</strong>. It means either a serious illness or cordial. There are lots of Kanji for cordial/courteous/respectful/etc., though, so maybe you might want to go with just serious illness. The trojan horse (which was magically brought to life) was unfortunately made out of bamboo, instead of wood. This made it seriously ill. It was still cordial about it&#039;s work, though, even though it knew it only had so much time left.
