## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet">sweetneet</a>] 4-11-2006(255): At the base of <em>mountain</em> <em>cliff</em>s, there is usually a<strong> beach</strong>. You often can see people lying there, <em>drying</em> off after a swim.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pete171">Pete171</a>] 17-11-2008(91): Three impossibilities for a <strong>beach</strong>: There cannot be a <strong>beach</strong> at the top of a <em>mountain</em>. There cannot be a<strong> beach</strong> on the top of a <em>cliff</em>. There cannot be a<strong> beach</strong> that is completely <em>dry</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 21-1-2006(39): I use a play on words here to help with the similar keywords such as &quot;strand&quot;, and &quot;coast&quot;. The<strong> Beach</strong> Boys just had a concert down at the<strong> beach</strong>, and they&#039;re all wet after the performance. It&#039;s not <em>dry</em> enough down at the<strong> beach</strong> so they climb the nearest <em>cliff</em>. Still, it&#039;s not <em>dry</em> enough there so they climb the nearest <em>mountain</em>. Finally, the air seems <em>dry</em> and they take a rest while their clothes <em>dry</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mesqueeb">Mesqueeb</a>] 13-4-2009(16): The fastest way to reach the<strong> beach</strong> starting from our mountain cabin is to go down the MOUNTAIN until the CLIFF and slide down the CLOTHESLINE directly onto the<strong> beach</strong>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 10-2-2011(11): A nude<strong> beach</strong> is generally sheltered from sight under a <em>mountains</em> or a <em>cliff</em>, where the bathers can <em>dry</em> in privacy.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meredithcat">meredithcat</a>] 7-8-2010(9): (kanjihito) A nude<strong> beach</strong> is generally sheltered from sight under <em>mountains</em> or a <em>cliff</em>, where the bathers can <em>dry</em> in privacy. Imagine a bunch of <em>clotheslines</em> at the entrance where you can leave your clothes.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nyquil">nyquil</a>] 24-3-2007(6): The<strong> beach</strong> is where the race ends. It&#039;s race that starts from the top of a <em>mountain</em>, then the contestants jump from a <em>cliff</em>, and then they have to swim to get to the<strong> beach</strong>. Once they arrive they can put their clothes to <em>dry</em> on the <em>clothesline</em> and join the party on the<strong> beach</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nussram">nussram</a>] 20-7-2012(2): Nude<strong> beach</strong>: mountains on one side, sheer cliffs on the other. There’s a clothesline where people leave their clothes. When people approach the cliff/edge of the mountain to steal clothes from the clothesline, they always catch a glimpse of the people on the<strong> beach</strong> and fall off the edge. Effective measure against theft.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Onikagii">Onikagii</a>] 5-4-2010(2): The only time a vampire can go to the<strong> beach</strong> is when it is under a cliff that is under a mountain otherwise he would die from exposure.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paramausi">paramausi</a>] 4-7-2009(2): Only <em>mountains</em> and <em>cliffs</em>? Looks like a very <em>dry</em><strong> beach</strong> to me.
