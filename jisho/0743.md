## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue">notgoing2argue</a>] 11-3-2008(298): Men walk with their <em>elbows</em> out from their <em>sides</em> in a weird <em>turkey</em> trot when they try to appear very MASCULINE. Think of a 70&#039;s pimp walk.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 15-4-2007(94): <strong>Masculine</strong> duties are to offer your <em>elbow</em> to the lady <em>by your left side</em> and to cut the <em>turkey</em> on special meals.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 9-7-2008(80): Surely you remember <a href="../563">feminine/female</a> (#563 雌)? In that kanji, we said <em>stop</em>/<em>spooning</em>/<em>turkeys</em>, spoon <strong>females</strong>! Here, once again, my buddy is looking at a <em>turkey</em>. What the heck is his problem? I give him a sharp <em>elbow</em> in the <em>side</em>. &quot;Dude, be a man!&quot; I said. &quot;Where&#039;s your MASCULINE side?&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hawkeye123">Hawkeye123</a>] 19-1-2009(26): While it&#039;s not <a href="../563">feminine/female</a> (#563 雌) to eat a turkey with a spoon, a <strong>masculine</strong> man would push people a<em>side</em> with his <em>elbow</em> to get to the <em>turkey</em> first.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 29-4-2007(16): Imagine a turkey making a pose like it&#039;s really buff....it&#039;s elbows are by their side at an angle.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 17-6-2008(12): Imagine a super cool TURKEY, sitting in his expensive car with the left ELBOW AT HIS SIDE, driving along the coast. How<strong> male</strong> he is indeed.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cheechuan">cheechuan</a>] 13-12-2007(11): In the most masculine man contest, the men have to hold a 200 pound <em>turkey</em> by their <em>side</em> using only their <em>elbows</em>. The champion is the one that can hold the longest.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 26-5-2009(5): Think back to <a href="../563">feminine/female</a> (#563 雌): <em>Stop spooning turkeys - spoon females!</em> Apparently we have to do this because our men keep looking at <em>turkeys.</em> So next time you see a guy scoping out a <em>turkey</em> to spoon, give him a sharp <em>elbow</em> to the <em>side</em> and remind him: <em>Stop spooning turkeys, you idiot! Spoon females</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sumomi">sumomi</a>] 14-12-2008(5): Den <strong>männlich</strong>en <em>Truthahn</em> erkennst du daran, dass er seine <em>Ellenbogen</em> <em>an der Seite</em> herausgesteckt hat. Muss sich schließlich <strong>männlich</strong> aufplustern.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cormbit">Cormbit</a>] 27-8-2012(3): <strong>Masculine</strong> is literally how a person is trying to act when <em>by their side</em>, their <em>elbows</em> are swinging, and their legs walk like a <em>turkey</em>.
