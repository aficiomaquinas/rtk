## Heisig story:

When &quot;<b>darkness</b> covered the earth&quot; at the beginning of time, there was neither <i>sun</i> nor <i>sound</i>.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 5-9-2007(160): Picture the sun exploding - there would be a gigantic noise and then...nothing. Everything would plunge into<strong> darkness</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sarek05">sarek05</a>] 20-6-2008(63): In places of complete <strong>darkness</strong>, such as caves where the <em>sun</em> can&#039;t reach, creatures such as bats have learned to navigate by <em>sound</em> rather than sight. The poor guys must have to fly around screaming &quot;Marco!&quot; and &quot;Polo!&quot; all the time.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eatyoda">eatyoda</a>] 6-9-2008(45): Total<strong> darkness</strong> lacks <em>sun</em> and <em>sound</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 6-4-2008(36): In the <strong>darkness</strong> of that dank solitary confinement cell, all you can do is fantasize about <em>sun</em> and <em>sound</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 8-8-2007(29): Heisig was careless with his story for <a href="../240">silence</a> (#240 黙). i have a really hard time confusing it for this one now.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snozle">snozle</a>] 9-12-2007(17): I associate this with a black hole. In a black hole, the epitome of<strong> darkness</strong>, there is neither <em>light</em> nor <em>sound</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cingold">cingold</a>] 17-8-2009(10): No <em>sun</em>, no <em>sound</em> just<strong> darkness</strong>...

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spann0r">spann0r</a>] 3-2-2009(10): In the<strong> darkness</strong> of deep space, there is neither <em>sun</em> nor <em>sound</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 1-1-2011(8): No sun, no sound - utter<strong> darkness</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 1-11-2007(7): In the <strong>darkness</strong> of deep space, there is neither <em>sun</em> nor <em>sound</em>. <em>Sun</em> comes first in this kanji, since it is most closely related to the topic. (tweaked version of dingomick&#039;s)(And why are people flagging that story with the warning icon? Non-biblical and very distinct from Heisig, IMHO).
