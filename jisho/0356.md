heisig: "From its original meaning of a defined area or zone, a <b>range</b> has also come to mean a grazing <i>land</i> where cowboys roam and do whatever it is they do with cows. When the herds have all been driven to market, there is a great homecoming <i>fiesta</i> like that pictured here. As soon as the cowboys come home, home on the <b>range</b>, the first thing they do is kiss the ground (the <i>mouth</i> on the <i>floor</i>), and then get on with the <i>fiesta</i>."
