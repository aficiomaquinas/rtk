## Heisig story:

From its original meaning of a defined area or zone, a <b>range</b> has also come to mean a grazing <i>land</i> where cowboys roam and do whatever it is they do with cows. When the herds have all been driven to market, there is a great homecoming <i>fiesta</i> like that pictured here. As soon as the cowboys come home, home on the <b>range</b>, the first thing they do is kiss the ground (the <i>mouth</i> on the <i>floor</i>), and then get on with the <i>fiesta</i>.

## Premitive:

fiesta(fiesta, swieto, swietowanie) The picture in this primitive is what we may call a &quot;tassled arrow.&quot; A decorative tassle is strung on the shaft of an arrow to indicate that it is no longer a weapon but a symbol of a fiesta. As before, the first stroke is extended when it serves as a semienclosure. o From its original meaning of a defined area or zone, a range has also come to meana grazing land where cowboys roam and do whatever it is they do with cows. When the herds have all been driven to market, there is a great homecoming fiesta like that pictured here. As soon as the cowboys come home, home on the range, the first thing they do is kiss the ground (the mouth on the floor), and then get on with the fiesta. [11]

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 10-10-2007(208): An astronaut lands back at the launch<strong> range</strong>, kisses the <em>earth</em> beneath him with his <em>mouth</em>, then heads off to a <em>fiesta</em> to celebrate a safe flight.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 23-7-2008(62): Instead of Heisig&#039;s &quot;Fiesta&quot; I use &quot;Spear&quot;. Why? A spear is just a DROP extra on an Arrow. 域 ,<strong> range</strong> actually means<strong> range</strong> as in limits/boundary/border sort of<strong> range</strong>(In a box it was the old meaning for Country 國 (581). Ok way too much etymology here, but back to story. With your SPEAR standing in a HOLE on the FLOOR with SOIL to its left9as you dug some out), you can see the<strong> RANGE</strong> of the spear in attacking a possible enemy (re Diablo and other RPGs, spear&#039;s have<strong> range</strong>).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jHerbin">jHerbin</a>] 8-4-2010(30): When the <em>land</em> was within <strong>range</strong>, the pirates <em>kissed the deck</em> and had a <em>fiesta</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shadolite">shadolite</a>] 19-2-2008(23): Dora and her party must travel over the<strong> range</strong> of earth, find the mouth of a cave on the ground, and then enter within to get to the fiesta. Remember: Land, Mouth on the ground, Fiesta!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 27-11-2008(19): Dirty mexicans like to kiss the floor at the fiestas on the<strong> range</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 3-10-2008(13): An extra <em>drop</em> on an <em>arrow</em>? That&#039;s a <em>spear</em>, Heisig, not a fiesta! The extent of <em>land</em> that is within<strong> range</strong> of my <em>spear</em> is everything to me, I kiss it (<em>mouth</em> on <em>ground</em>).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tstuhldreher">tstuhldreher</a>] 30-5-2008(10): For a free<strong> range</strong> chicken, just putting its ONE MOUTH on the GROUND to peck at grain is like a FIESTA compared to all those poor factory-raised chickens stuffed in cages.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harhol">harhol</a>] 10-4-2009(9): I recall stealing a Ford FIESTA in my younger days and being involved in a high speed police chase. I drove through the GROUNDS of a golf course for several miles but my joyride eventually came to an end on the driving<strong> range</strong>, where a stray golf ball smashed through the windscreen, hit me in the MOUTH, knocked out ONE of my teeth and left me unconscious. Needless to say I haven&#039;t been to a driving<strong> range</strong> since.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/JasonCRomero">JasonCRomero</a>] 7-9-2009(8): Out on the <strong>range</strong> in Brokeback Mountain the two cowboys <em>kissed</em> (made one mouth) on the <em>ground</em> and had their own <em>fiesta</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stevieman">Stevieman</a>] 17-3-2010(6): As liosama said the &#039;<em>fiesta</em>&#039; part in chinese means <em>lance</em> or <em>spear</em> (stake with a blade), the box is the primitive &#039;<em>pent in</em>&#039; or &#039;<em>enclosure</em>&#039; (primitive before <a href="../v4/578">sayeth</a> (#578 曰)) and the floor representing &#039;<em>ground</em>&#039;. All come together to represent a <em>lance</em> marking a <em>region</em> (like those spears with skulls tribes use to mark off their land) SO <em>region</em> + <em>ground</em> =<strong> range</strong> of a region. mnemonic: <em>spear</em> in <em>land</em> marks off <em>enclosure</em>/<strong>range</strong> of <em>land</em>.
