heisig: "The <i>person</i> on the left is familiar. As for the right side, we may combine the <i>insect</i> with a <i>brain</i> (observe the writing) and a <i>belt</i> to create the <i>Talking Cricket</i> who served as Pinocchio's conscience. (<i>The belt</i> is there because he pulls it off to give unrepentant little Pinocchio a bit of &quot;strap&quot; now and again.)"
