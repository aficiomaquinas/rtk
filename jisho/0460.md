## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 27-7-2006(130): The nicest<strong> bridge</strong> is not in Holly<em>wood</em> or Los <em>Angel</em>es, but in San Francisco.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun">sutebun</a>] 30-10-2007(93): A small 5 year old child has lost her mother in a tragic death. Her family tells her, &quot;Don&#039;t worry, your mom is an angel now, in heaven, watching over you.&quot; The small girl takes this very literally and is found one day, gathering pieces of wood. Her dad asks her, &quot;What are you doing with that wood?&quot; &quot;I&#039;m trying to build a<strong> bridge</strong> to heaven to visit the angels.&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 23-3-2008(52): <strong>BRIDGE</strong> makes me remember a tacky religious icon of my youth, showing a guardian <em>angel</em> guiding two bonny children over a dangerously tatty <em>wooden</em><strong> BRIDGE</strong>; by pure chance (ahem) I found the picture online, see <a href="http://www.sacredtreasures.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/Guardian_angel_on_the_Bridge.199121024_std.jpg">http://www.sacredtreasures.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/Guardian_angel_on_the_Bridge.199121024_std.jpg</a> &#039;Angel&#039;, incidentally, means &#039;messenger&#039;, hence two mouths - one who gave the message above, the other who delivered it here below.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 28-7-2008(45): The <em>wooden</em><strong> bridge</strong> is guarded by an impressively tall <em>angel</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 16-6-2008(23): ANGEL primitive: On the bottom there is a HOODED MOUTH, which you can think of as a NUN; and shes praying to an ANGEL, which is the HEAVENLY MOUTH above.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 9-11-2008(20): I picture<strong> bridge</strong> supports made out of wooden angels.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Baaschido">Baaschido</a>] 23-7-2009(10): Jacob&#039;s Ladder: Here it is a <em>wooden</em> <strong>bridge</strong> where we see <em>angels</em> walking up and down. Tip: 天 and 夭 (heavens and sapling) are different, but RTK confuses them sometimes. The latter appears in numbers 634, 938, 2078, 2079, 2080, and all characters containing angel 喬 (429, 430, 1221, 2104, 2120, 2369).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/frychiko">frychiko</a>] 7-7-2008(7): There are no WOODEN<strong> bridge</strong>s up in HEAVEN because ANGELS can just fly over them!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eroichigo">eroichigo</a>] 24-5-2009(6): The angel grabbed a tree and created a<strong> bridge</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(5): A <strong>bridge</strong> is like a <em>wooden</em> <em>angel</em>, saving you from the water below.
