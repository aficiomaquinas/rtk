## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 16-3-2007(215): The <em>samurai</em> sits on the <em>altar</em> and watches the <strong>slave</strong> <em>rake rice</em> all day.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 2-1-2008(95): The samurai from <a href="../v4/1097">goodwill</a> (#1097 款) maintains his good mood on his wedding day. He tells his <strong>slave</strong> that he can keep all <em>rice</em> (used for confetti) that he <em>rakes</em> up after the ceremony. Generous Man!!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/playadom">playadom</a>] 16-1-2009(28): The <em>samurai</em> sits on the <em>altar</em> and watches the <strong>slave</strong> sieve rice through a sieve all day.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 22-4-2008(11): This is what happens if you anger the gods by jumping up and down the <em>altar</em> (see <a href="../v4/1097">goodwill</a> (#1097 款)). The <em>samurai</em> is <em>apprehended</em> (<a href="../v4/1160">apprehend</a> (#1160 逮)), turned into a <strong>slave</strong> and made to <em>sieve grains of rice</em> all day, as a punishment for losing his <em>sanity</em> (<a href="../v4/1159">ease/sane</a> (#1159 康)).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 24-11-2007(11): Hmm, SAMURAI and ALTAR makes a good primitive called PALADINS (or Knights Templar if that&#039;s your thing). SIEVE was already set up. So, the PALADINS went on a quest to the holy land, there they caught in a SIEVE set by the moors and became<strong> SLAVE</strong>S in the holy land (picture Costner at the beginning of Robin Hood).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 20-3-2008(10): Careful: <a href="../v4/848">retainer</a> (#848 臣). Think of<strong> slave</strong> in the virtual sense (a<strong> slave</strong> to your passions). The <em>samurai</em> is standing on the <em>altar</em> lecturing about goodwill (see <a href="../v4/1097">goodwill</a> (#1097 款)). He notices the boredom of most of the crowd. However some audience members are attentive about the message of goodwill. The <em>samurai</em> views his sermon as a <em>sieve</em> of character: those of good character pass through and see the merit; those of poor character -<strong> slave</strong>s to their passions - are blocked from understanding.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Puchatek">Puchatek</a>] 8-7-2011(5): Here we see a senior <em>samurai</em> standing in front of the <em>altar</em> and <em>sieving</em> out<strong> slave</strong>s (through a huge <em>sieve</em>) to see if any of them are suitable to become <em>samurais</em>. I imagine it is some kind of a once-a-year only occasion, which helps to justify the need for an <em>altar</em> (it&#039;s such a special occasion), and those<strong> slave</strong> that are suitable to become <em>samurai</em> are those that can make it through the <em>sieve</em> as opposed to the whole bunch of<strong> slave</strong>s that failed and remain crammed up in <em>the sieve</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 28-3-2011(5): The samurai from <a href="../v4/1097">goodwill</a> (#1097 款) was angry at the peasants who yawned, so he turned them into his<strong> slave</strong>s and set them to work cleaning <em>grains of rice</em> with a <em>sieve</em>. 奴隷 どれい<strong> slave</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 22-1-2009(4): In an attempt to free them from being <strong>slaves</strong> to their desires, the <em>samurai</em> stands behind the <em>altar</em> likening a clear mind to a <em>sieve</em> that lets only the purest thoughts through.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 31-7-2008(3): <em>Samurai</em> standing at the <em>altar</em> of a temple deep in thought, trying to <em>sift through</em> his feelings, in hopes of avoiding becoming a<strong> slave</strong> to them.
