heisig: To avoid confusion with the image of rice seedlings to appear later, we shall take these <b>seedlings</b> out of their agricultural setting in the <i>rice fields</i> and into the frame of Brave New World surgery, where "ideas" or "values" are being implanted into <i>brains</i> like <b>seedlings</b> to insure a harmonious society. Then you need only imagine them taking root and breaking out into <i>flower</i> right through the tops of the skulls of people walking around on the streets.
