## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 17-12-2006(249): The maple <strong>tree</strong> is very <strong>negative</strong> about it, but the farmer still collects <em>cupfuls</em> of maple syrup from it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44">brian44</a>] 29-11-2007(61): Ｗｈｅｎ　ｙｏｕ　ｓａｙ　［いっぱい」　Ｔｈｅ　ｋａｎｊｉ　ｉｓ <a href="http://google.com/#q=一杯．">一杯．</a> Just think of Wooden cups being used for drinking, but drinking<strong> CUPFULS</strong> is Negative as you might get sick.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 6-3-2009(30): The kanji for いっぱい is <a href="http://google.com/#q=一杯．">一杯．</a> One cup is great, two cups still good, but if you have so many<strong> cupfuls</strong> that you pass out under a <em>tree</em>, the situation has turned <em>negative</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 7-5-2007(20): A wooden cup is a piece of <em>wood</em> with <em>negative</em> space waiting to be filled by the <em>cupfuls</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 6-3-2007(17): If you want the <em>tree</em> to show <em>negative</em> growth, you should use a few <strong>cupsful</strong> of poison every day.

However, if you drink many<strong> cupfuls</strong>, as most Japanese men are prone to do, it can become a very <em>NEGATIVE</em> experience.
