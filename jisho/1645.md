## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue">notgoing2argue</a>] 31-8-2007(311): Spiderman buys a <em>locket</em> for Mary Jane because he wants to get<strong> HORIZONTAL</strong> with her. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 31-5-2007(54): Spiderman on a boat, marking the Earth&#039;s <strong>latitudes</strong>. He first attaches a personal locket to a small piece of thread for ballast and good luck, and shoots with his right hand. After a few minutes (and lots and lots of thread), the <em>locket and thread</em> have flown around the world. Spiderman catches the locket with his left hand, and ties the thread&#039;s ends together. Voilà. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 21-1-2006(27): Hint : this kanji also means &quot;latitude&quot;, which are the<strong> horizontal</strong> lines on a globe. Do you remember James Heisig&#039;s story for frame 175 &quot;black ink&quot; ? Here a cartographer on a ship, is using his &quot;<em>thread locket</em>&quot; to mark<strong> horizontal</strong> lines on a map. He pulls a chalked thread from the locket, and snaps it to mark<strong> horizontal</strong> lines. Imagine the &quot;thread-locket&quot; in the shape of a globe, filled with dark powder and a little bobbin of thread. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scotty28">scotty28</a>] 14-12-2009(17): Spiderman gave up being spiderman and promised Mary Jane to live the<strong> horizontal</strong> life like the rest of us. Whenever he starts to feel like he wants to go back to his spidy ways, he takes out his locket with a mary jane picture to remind him that he will forever live<strong> horizontal</strong>y. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 26-3-2009(13): Imagine yourself tie a <em>locket</em> to the end of a <em>thread</em> and spin it<strong> horizontal</strong>ly.. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet">sweetneet</a>] 14-2-2007(11): You eventually find your lost <em>locket</em>, lying<strong> horizontal</strong>ly, broken off the chain. So you put a piece of <em>thread</em> on it. You don&#039;t hang it (vertically) around your neck anymore, as its weight is likely too much (that&#039;s likely what caused the necklace to break in the first place). So instead, you keep it<strong> horizontal</strong>, secured in your purse with the <em>thread</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 16-11-2008(8): After the Korean War, the two sides asked Spiderman to divide the country. Spiderman has never been to Korea so he just looked at the map and found a<strong> horizontal</strong> line dividing the country, so he just used that. (Sort of a true story, minus Spiderman). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matsuyamakiwi">matsuyamakiwi</a>] 29-6-2008(6): <em>Spiderman</em> (as Peter Parker) lies<strong> horizontal</strong> every night on his bed fantasizing about Mary Jane. He holds her stolen <em>locket</em> in his hands like Gollum&#039;s ring...my preccciouss. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 14-9-2009(4): The <em>thread</em> that holds the <em>locket</em> around my neck is choker-length so it stays <em>horizontal</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bexinkyushu">bexinkyushu</a>] 15-9-2011(3): If <em>Spiderman</em> was <em>eccentric</em>, he would spin his web<strong> horizontal</strong> instead of vertical.
