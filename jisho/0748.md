## Heisig story:

Part of the body . . . pedestal.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 28-4-2006(311): The body part feminists like to put on a pedestal is the<strong> womb</strong>, especially when they hear a man complain about some responsibility. &quot;We give birth, so it&#039;s your duty to do so-and-so&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 4-2-2008(184): If any <em>body part</em> deserves to be put on a <em>pedestal</em>, it is the<strong> womb</strong> from which new life springs forth.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 3-1-2007(60): In this kanji pedestal carries a sense of base, or stand. The<strong> womb</strong> is part of the body that acts as a pedestal: a base or stand from which a new human being is brought into life.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mrred">mrred</a>] 11-10-2008(22): Imagine the <strong>womb</strong> as a <em>part of the body</em> which contains a little <a href="../744">pedestal</a> (#744 台) for the baby to stand on. Picture the baby, like a little statue of a cherub, standing on its pedestal in the fleshy<strong> womb</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 23-12-2007(13): I suggest studing this kanji alongside with <a href="../747">commence</a> (#747 始). The<strong> womb</strong> is the <em>part of the body</em> with a <em>mouth</em> from which the matron took you out when you were born, using her <em>elbow</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 14-4-2007(7): Even in his mother&#039;s<strong> womb</strong>, the <em>Golden Medal Winner Bastard</em> could be seen (on ultra-sound) clutching a piece of <em>flesh</em> to his chest that looked a lot like a golden medal. Flesh is the same on the left as in <a href="../531">placenta</a> (#531 胞).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/konakona50">konakona50</a>] 26-9-2008(6): A<strong> womb</strong> is basically a fleshy pedestal for embryos to grow in.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Clint">Clint</a>] 10-8-2008(6): If there&#039;s any single <em>part of the body</em> that should be on a <em>pedestal</em>, it&#039;s the<strong> womb</strong>, since every single human being who has ever been born came from one.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 21-2-2006(4): A<strong> womb</strong> with a view has a fleshy pedestal to climb up and look outside.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 22-5-2009(3): Monthly pedestal syndrome...(PMS rearranged) stems from the<strong> womb</strong>.
