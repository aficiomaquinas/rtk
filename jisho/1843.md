## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 20-3-2007(58): I paint a huge <em>eye</em> on the side of my <em>pup tent</em>. Why? – It’s<strong> obvious</strong>: when I’m at the camping site it makes it<strong> obvious</strong> which tent is mine so I can quickly locate it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch">NeoGlitch</a>] 18-2-2012(16): RevTKers please, open your <em>eye</em>s!! That&#039;s not a puptent you see! It&#039;s <em>kagaribi</em> (尞), fuel used for sacrifices. I know it wasn&#039;t<strong> obvious</strong> at first, but I hope it&#039;s clear to you now! :D.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 6-3-2010(10): It&#039;s<strong> obvious</strong> that the <em>pup tent</em> with a huge <em>eye</em> on the side belongs to the dark lord Sauron.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sabretou">sabretou</a>] 24-4-2013(2): While we were sitting down at the camp having our dinner, Tom kept <em>eyeing</em> Mary and subtly motioning towards the <em>pup tent</em>. It was<strong> obvious</strong> to us all what his eyes were going on about, but Mary remained confused.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 23-8-2011(2): 明瞭な , 一目瞭然の , <a href="../v4/2582">obvious</a> (#2582 瞭) リョウ(尞), ( 名乗り : あきら) ...

Everyone brings single <em>pup tents</em>, and it&#039;s a blast. The second night, though, start hanging with a friend (of the attractive sex) ...and you two sort of hit it off. You try to keep it a secret from the rest of your group...but it&#039;s starting to get<strong> obvious</strong>. You&#039;re always <em>eyeing</em> each other in group activities...your friend says &quot;Come on, just say it...it&#039;s totally<strong> obvious</strong>. I put my eye up to her <em>pup tent</em> last night and saw you two in there.&quot;.
