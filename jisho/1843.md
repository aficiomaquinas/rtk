## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 23-2-2007(135): <strong>County</strong> cricket. &quot;I say <em>old boy</em>, you&#039;ve hit that ball clear over the <em>city walls</em>. That&#039;s six and out!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 10-10-2007(88): You can take the <em>good old boy</em> out of<strong> county</strong> (and into the <em>city walls</em>), but you can&#039;t take the<strong> county</strong> out of the <em>good old boy</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 11-8-2007(40): A ぐん is smaller than a prefecture so you can see the city walls. It sounds like 君 (くん).
