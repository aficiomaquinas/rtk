## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 20-9-2006(190): <strong>Sad</strong>dness is like having your <em>heart</em> captured and <em>jailed</em> because of some<strong> sad</strong> or terrible event, etc. Here the<strong> sad</strong> <em>heart</em> waits for someone to come and <em>un</em>-lock their <em>jail cell</em> and set them free again. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 21-8-2006(74): Stuck in a <em>jail cell</em> with his <em>heart</em> crying out to see his family again, the prisoner has never felt so<strong> sad</strong>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 9-7-2007(48): A <em>jail cell</em> will make any <em>heart</em><strong> sad</strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcbainpc">mcbainpc</a>] 19-8-2008(24): For some reason, this kanji makes me think of some Toni Braxton song, but I change the lyrics to &quot;Un-<em>jail</em> my <em>heart</em>&quot;. Now that mnemonic has stuck in my head. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 23-12-2008(9): Imagine the<strong> sad</strong> image of a prisoner in a <em>jail cell</em> feeling<strong> sad</strong> as he looks at all the little <em>hearts</em> his daughter used to draw for him when she was just a child. Now she wants nothing to do with him. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 31-3-2006(7): A very<strong> sad</strong> man comes to <em>jail</em> regularly to visit his <em>heart</em>. See, his <em>heart</em> was <em>jailed</em> for life (it was a rotten, despicable heart), and now he has to live without it, unable to enjoy the smiles of people, affection, love... 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hisashikun">hisashikun</a>] 8-3-2010(5): (the top part looks like ribs.) When you become<strong> sad</strong>, your heart sinks to the bottom of your chest. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 5-3-2009(4): Though he looks happy in photographs, in his <em>heart</em>, <em>goatse</em> man is actually very<strong> sad</strong>. Don&#039;t be<strong> sad</strong>, <em>goatse</em> man, you&#039;ve brought joy to millions with gullible friends. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 14-7-2010(3): <strong>Sad</strong>, wasting away in a <em>jail cell</em> with a sinking <em>heart</em>.
