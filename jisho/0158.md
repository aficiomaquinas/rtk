heisig: "You have heard of people &quot;attaching&quot; themselves to a particular sect? Here is your chance to take that metaphor literally and imagine some fellow walking into a <b>Buddhist temple</b> with a fervent resolve to attach himself to the place. Since there is plenty of unused <i>land</i> around the precincts, he simply picks out a suitable patch, brushes the soles of his feet with <i>glue</i>, steps down firmly, and so joins the <b>Buddhist temple</b> as a &quot;permanent member.&quot;"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps">ceeeps</a>] 3-9-2007(179): At the<strong> Buddhist temple</strong> the monks are seated on the <em>ground</em>, <em>glued</em> there in meditation. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Murjab">Murjab</a>] 2-9-2007(45): To be allowed to join the<strong> Buddhist temple</strong>, imagine an aspiring monk being asked to stand still in the <em>soil</em> for a long time in a <em>measurement</em> of his resolve. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 3-2-2008(21): How long a<strong> BUDDHIST TEMPLE</strong> has stood on its <em>grounds</em> is often a <em>measure</em> of its worth. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 12-9-2007(12): The Buddhist in the temple sit on the <em>ground</em> for years contemplating life, the universe, and everything. Not because they want to but because someone switched the floor wax with <em>superglue</em>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hornlo">hornlo</a>] 12-5-2011(7): [ <strong>Buddhist temple</strong> = <em>soil</em> / <em>glue</em> ] - in a <strong>Buddhist temple</strong>, you can free yourself of the <em>earth</em> that <em>glues</em> you to this world. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saleem">saleem</a>] 19-3-2008(7): Visualize some all the crazy world changing shifting, being destroyed by war, etc. And through it all the BUIDDHIST TEMPLE sits steady, as if it were GLUED to the GROUND. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oharawinter">oharawinter</a>] 27-6-2012(6): It is ironic that the kanji for<strong> Buddhist temple</strong> is composed by two elements Buddhism is meant to alleviate: earthliness and attachment. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS">TerryS</a>] 28-5-2009(3): <em>Soil</em> mixed with <em>glue</em> formed the blocks used in the<strong> BUDDHIST TEMPLE</strong>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kasuka">kasuka</a>] 20-1-2012(2): The soil has to be measured before the<strong> buddhist temple</strong> can be built. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ctwolfe">Ctwolfe</a>] 13-2-2011(2): The earth above this measurement will make the perfect<strong> Buddhist temple</strong>.
