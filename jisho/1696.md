## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-9-2007(175): That&#039;s the homeless <strong>ward</strong> of the city. <em>Wolverine</em> lives in a <em>cardboard box</em> there. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 31-1-2006(33): In the<strong> ward</strong> office the <em>sheaves</em> of paper of the<strong> ward</strong> registration forms are kept in a <em>box</em>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dusmar84">dusmar84</a>] 1-2-2010(26): In the Akihabara<strong> ward</strong>, it is mandated that every resident own an X-BOX (well more like a PS3 but you get the point). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 6-3-2008(14): This is a special<strong> ward</strong> at the hospital for bad crops, where the farmers gently bring in their <em>sheaves</em> tucked away in little <em>boxes</em> for treatment, the poor things. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/henroski">henroski</a>] 7-6-2008(10): X man lives in a small BOX apartment in Shibuya<strong> WARD</strong>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/squeaky_lill_mk">squeaky_lill_mk</a>] 15-8-2010(6): In the homeless <strong>ward</strong> of the city, <em>Death</em> lives in a <em>cardboard box</em> [dingomick]. It&#039;s just another attempt by <em>Death</em> to understand humans, along the lines of its antics in <em>Mort</em>. (I use Terry Pratchett&#039;s <em>Death</em> as a primitive for <a href="../1488">reap</a> <span class="index">(#1488 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/刈">刈</a>)</span>, <a href="../1489">hope</a> <span class="index">(#1489 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/希">希</a>)</span>, <a href="../1490">villain</a> <span class="index">(#1490 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/凶">凶</a>)</span>, <a href="../1493">kill</a> <span class="index">(#1493 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/殺">殺</a>)</span>). 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 11-11-2007(6): This kanji looks like a pictograph of the <em>star</em> and <em>crescent</em>, a frequently-used Islamic symbol (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_and_crescent">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_and_crescent</a>). Think of the middle-eastern<strong> ward</strong> in your city to associate the kanji with the meaning.
