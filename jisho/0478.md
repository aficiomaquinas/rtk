## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sannomiya">sannomiya</a>] 27-11-2006(302): When you<strong> DIVIDE</strong> someone, there is sure to be a lot of screaming. That&#039;s why you should use a MUZZLE before using the SABER.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod">PacifistGod</a>] 8-6-2008(80): <strong>Divide</strong> and Conquer: Shut &#039;em Up and Cut &#039;em Up.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 31-8-2007(67): <strong>Divide</strong> and conquer - first you cut them up (saber) , then you shut them up (muzzle).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 22-11-2006(36): The two women keep arguing about whose baby it is. So Solomon muzzles the both of them, pulls out a sword, and prepares to<strong> divide</strong> the child between the two.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tstuhldreher">tstuhldreher</a>] 6-6-2008(17): In order to MUZZLE the two complaining women, Solomon offered to<strong> divide</strong> the child with a SABER.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jslindst">jslindst</a>] 12-10-2008(10): When Dexter (The TV Series) <strong>divides</strong> a criminal with his <em>saber</em>, he always <em>muzzles</em> them up so they cannot scream.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 27-4-2008(9): Shut them up, and then cut them up...

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 25-11-2010(7): 死体解剖 , 解剖学 <a href="../478">divide</a> (#478 剖) ボウ ... Parts:咅, 刂 ... Note: This is <em>not</em><strong> divide</strong>, that is 割る , or 分ける . For RTK testing purposes, make your stories about <strong>dissection</strong>, so later on you don&#039;t get confused by this.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Newkie">Newkie</a>] 24-6-2009(7): <strong>Divide</strong> and conquer - first you shut them up (<em>muzzle</em>), then you cut them up(<em>saber</em>)------ Edited version of dihutenosa story, to better remember positioning :).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/axelb">axelb</a>] 4-1-2010(6): Do not confuse with <a href="../90">separate</a> (#90 別). This is a verb, and thus more active, hence the need to <em>muzzle</em> the dividing of the <em>sword</em>. (<a href="../90">separate</a> (#90 別) is also an adjective). Perhaps use the V in<strong> divide</strong> as a reminder: it is an open sword cut, and picured in the Vase-part of the sign.
