## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 12-9-2006(193): A true <em>stamp</em> collecting nerd won&#039;t be able to<strong> repress</strong> the urge to get his <em>fingers</em> on the latest <em>box</em> of collector <em>stamps</em>!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 10-8-2007(102): They would <strong>repress</strong> dissents by cutting off their <em>fingers</em> and mailing them to relatives in <em>small boxes</em> (of course including <em>stamps</em> for proper postage).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 12-4-2008(49): A chikan (bus-molester) tries to<strong> repress</strong> his <em>finger</em>-groping desire by refusing to travel by bus anymore. Instead, he seals himself in a <em>box</em>, makes sure there are enough <em>postage stamps</em> on the outside, and mails himself. He&#039;s a good man at heart , you see... just a bit of a slave to his libido. (I suggest using this same Chikan as the primitive for the &quot;box and stamp&quot; combo on the right side of this kanji, which come up more than once later on).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jajaaan">jajaaan</a>] 30-12-2009(29): I&#039;m just gonna say what we&#039;re all thinking. Young women work hard to<strong> repress</strong> their urges to put their <em>fingers</em> in their <em>boxes</em> because if their mothers found out, they could be <em>stamped</em> with a big WHORE stamp across their faces for the rest of their lives. Such a stamping is avoided by severe <strong>repression</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 29-12-2006(15): The right side is a rabbit ( 卯 ) that has lost one ear. He (I&#039;m thinking of a cartoony rabbit who has lost the ear in some battle with an enemy) has to<strong> repress</strong> (concretely, with his fingers!) his urge to revenge, which is hard to contain in his little head.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 8-2-2009(11): <strong>Repress</strong>ing a memory: You use your finger to pull the memory out of your head(kind of like Dumbledore), then you stick it in a box, put on the proper postage, and send it away. You&#039;ll never have to think of it again.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-9-2007(10): <em>Shrek</em> tries to <strong>repress</strong> his <em>stamp collecting</em> desire by buring his <em>stamps</em> in a <em>tupperware box</em>. (Condensed Box Primitive: <em>STAMP COLLECTING</em>, stamps in little boxes).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 1-1-2009(9): Although I do my best to<strong> repress</strong> the memory, I will never forget the day a <em>small stamped box</em> arrived for me. I opened it to find my ex-girlfriend&#039;s <em>finger</em> lying there. Ah well, shit happens... (<em>continued in next kanji</em>).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Robatsu">Robatsu</a>] 24-8-2009(7): Yakuza<strong> REPRESS</strong> their enemies by removing the <em>fingers</em>, putting them into a <em>small box</em>, <em>stamp</em> it and post them to their families.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/seminotti">seminotti</a>] 30-1-2010(6): For the right, I&#039;m using raulir&#039;s &quot;<em>rabbit ( 卯 ) that has lost one ea</em>r&quot;. As he&#039;s just lost it, he has to use his <em>fingers</em> to<strong> repress</strong> the bleeding.
