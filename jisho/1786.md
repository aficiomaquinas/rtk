## Reading:

### On-Yomi: ヨ &mdash; Kun-Yomi: あま.る、あま.り、あま.す、あんま.り

## Heisig story:

<i>Umbrella</i> . . . <i>potato</i> . . . <i>little</i>. The last stroke of <i>potato</i> and the first of <i>little</i> coincide in this character.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 11-7-2007(183): You hang an <em>umbrella</em> upside-down on a hook of the <strong>scales</strong> and fill it with <em>little</em> <em>potatoes</em>. No luck: it weights <strong>too much</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 7-3-2008(147): This is the kanji for 「あまり Amari」, which means <strong>too little</strong> in negative sentences and <strong>too much</strong> in the rest (always with a negative sense). I take the liberty of using the symbol &quot;&gt;&quot; (<strong>more than</strong>, another meaning!!) as the <em>umbrella</em> component, and using <a href="../v4/2">two</a> (#2 二) and <a href="../v4/105">little</a> (#105 小) for the <em>potato</em> primitive. So, this kanji either means &quot;<em>two</em> much&quot; (more than 2) or &quot;<em>two little</em>&quot;. (thanks, Virtua_leaf and Thunderball!).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BigAmish">BigAmish</a>] 2-7-2008(50): I was worried that my <em>POTATOES</em> were getting<strong> TOO MUCH</strong> direct sunlight so I stood over them with an <em>UMBRELLA</em>. Now they are getting too <em>LITTLE</em> rain! I clearly have<strong> TOO MUCH</strong> free time on my hands.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rowdyphantom">rowdyphantom</a>] 17-11-2009(25): <em>Umbrellas</em> for <em>little potatoes</em>??? That&#039;s<strong> too much</strong>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Talka">Talka</a>] 12-9-2007(11): You&#039;re weighing potatoes to take from the market but they weigh<strong> too much</strong>. It&#039;s windy, so you hook your umbrella onto the scale hoping to subtract weight by catching the wind&#039;s force. Still<strong> too much</strong> weight. Just give up and select some smaller potatoes, man. Won&#039;t be<strong> too much</strong> weight then.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 10-12-2008(10): A <em>little umbrella</em> accessory for <em>Mr. Potato Head</em>?! That&#039;s just<strong> too much</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 23-4-2008(9): You try carrying your bunch of little potatoes home in your umbrella, but they weigh<strong> too much</strong> and your poor umbrella breaks. You should have known, since the scale was spinning earlier when you put your little potatoes on it, indicating they might be<strong> too much</strong> for your umbrella.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 1-10-2009(8): &quot;Ahaha, that&#039;s<strong> too much</strong>!&quot; says the comedian at his own joke. Unfortunately the crowd don&#039;t see it that way and start pelting him with <em>little potatoes</em>. He glumly holds his <em>umbrella</em> up to shield himself.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bexinkyushu">bexinkyushu</a>] 15-9-2011(4): As Heisig said,<strong> too much</strong> is an abstract word to work with in the 6 stories that follow. I&#039;ve struggled with <em>scale</em> so I&#039;ve made my own primitive - <em>prize potato</em>. Story: Someone growing a <strong>prize potato</strong> for a competition sticks <em>an umbrella</em> over his crop to prevent<strong> too much</strong> sunlight. .the key is to only provide <em>a little</em> sun.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 26-1-2010(4): New Primitive: <em>Bathroom Scale</em>. Mr. Potato Head doesn&#039;t want Mrs. Potato Head to see his weight on the scale so he puts up an <em>umbrella</em> before stepping on it. He didn&#039;t anticipate she would send <em>little</em> potato heads to spy under the umbrella.
