## Heisig story:

<i>Tree</i> . . . <i>branch</i>. Take a moment to focus on the differences between a <b>bough</b>, a <i>branch</i>, and a <i>twig</i> (Frame 319).

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 29-11-2006(269): The <em>tree&#039;s</em> primary <em>branch</em> is known as the<strong> bough</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 6-6-2008(94): Differentiate between<strong> BOUGH</strong> and <a href="../v4/711">branch</a> (#711 支): &#039;branch&#039; is smaller, and can also refer to the branch of a store ( 支店 ), which has nothing to do with a tree. But a<strong> BOUGH</strong> is a main part of a tree, perhaps where the trunk splits into several large<strong> bough</strong>s, and so it logically utilizes the 木 radical.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tcjeff">tcjeff</a>] 10-6-2008(25): I think of a<strong> bough</strong> as a <em>branch</em> that&#039;s big enough to be a <em>tree</em> itself.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 29-11-2008(13): 支 (branch) is not actually used for tree branches, but rather for conceptual branches, like a store branch, or a branch of mathematics. 枝 (bough), on the other hand, is an actual <em>branch</em> from a <em>tree</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 14-10-2005(11): As James Heisig suggests, let&#039;s take a moment to focus on the differences between a<strong> bough</strong>, a branch, and a twig. A twig is “a small, leafless branch of a woody plant”. A<strong> bough</strong> is “a large or main <em>branch</em> of a <em>tree</em>” (a branch is somewhere in between the<strong> bough</strong>s and the twigs).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wazato">wazato</a>] 5-10-2007(6): A<strong> bough</strong> is a branch of a tree.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 10-12-2009(4): The<strong> bough</strong> is the main <em>branch</em> of a <em>tree</em>. (Oxford Dictionary).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/generatort">generatort</a>] 19-3-2012(3): Some <em>trees</em> greet each other by shaking <em>branches</em>, but Japanese <em>trees</em> <strong>bough</strong>. What a pun.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwm503">dwm503</a>] 15-3-2011(3): A<strong> bough</strong> is where a tree begins to branch off from the trunk.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lugelen">lugelen</a>] 15-12-2011(2): When the<strong> bough</strong> breaks, the cradle will fall~♫. The <em>tree</em> still has <em>branches</em>, but they&#039;re all small~♫.
