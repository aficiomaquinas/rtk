## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple">greenapple</a>] 27-8-2006(198): Water is doubly mysterious. It&#039;s in all our nourishment...and yet, it&#039;s really not<strong> nourishing</strong> at all. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Okonomiyaki">Okonomiyaki</a>] 24-5-2008(113): Going off the idea of the right side meaning rapid growth/increase of small objects, I&#039;ve decided to make the right side be <em>Gremlins</em>, those little <em>mysterious</em> creatures that <em>double</em> rapidly. <em>Gremlins</em> find <em>water</em> a little too<strong> nourishing</strong>, as it makes them instantly multiply. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 7-1-2008(40): Because <em>Siamese twins</em> need twice as much fluid as their single body produces, the most<strong> nourishing</strong> thing they can have is <em>water</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 29-7-2006(30): It’s <em>doubly mysterious</em> how <em>water</em> can be so<strong> nourishing</strong>—it doesn’t seem to have any substance and yet we would die without it. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 24-5-2006(22): Gandalf (<a href="../1383">mysterious</a> <span class="index">(#1383 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/玄">玄</a>)</span>) finds<strong> nourishing</strong> water that reflects an evil double Gandalf looming beneath the surface. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 18-2-2008(14): Right part has the meaning of rapid growth/increase of small objects: 「茲 しげる culture (biol); here」.<strong> Nourishing</strong> <em>water</em> favors the <em>culture of plankton</em>, which are food for the fishes. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 21-1-2008(13): I invented a new<strong> NOURISHING</strong> energy drink. Take ANIMAL HORNS, and on each HORN squeeze a COCOON (the way you might squeeze a orange with those special machines), then throw the whole thing into a pot of WATER. It gives you the strength of bull (animal horns) and the agility of a grasshopper (cocoon). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/walexander5">walexander5</a>] 5-9-2008(9): <em>Gandalf and Sarumon</em> originally became friends when Sarumon gave <strong><a href="../1388">nourishing</a> <span class="index">(#1388 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/滋">滋</a>)</span></strong> <em>water</em> to Gandalf as an orphaned child. Showing <strong><a href="../1389">mercy</a> <span class="index">(#1389 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/慈">慈</a>)</span></strong> to the child who had won his <em>heart</em>, he decided to teach him the ways of the wizard. Many years later, however, his heart would turn to <em>stone</em> as he was attracted like a <strong><a href="../1390">magnet</a> <span class="index">(#1390 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/磁">磁</a>)</span></strong> to the powerful and evil Sauron. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 25-8-2009(6): This kanji looks like a pineapple- a very juicy,<strong> nourishing</strong>, fruit . And doubly mysterious because it&#039;s neither a pine nor an apple. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 15-7-2009(4): The primitive for the two mysteries will be <strong>Mystery</strong>, any random player who thinks he knows the secret to women and tries to teach it to others. <em>Mystery&#039;s</em> first hint to pick up women? Drink <em>wate</em>r. Without<strong> nourishing</strong> yourself, you&#039;ll die, and they you won&#039;t get any women. First step completed, and onward~!
