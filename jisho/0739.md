4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sleepyday">sleepyday</a>] 30-9-2008(20): This character depicts that of someone standing at the entrance of a <em>cave.</em> He&#039;s standing there with his hands on his hips, and his <em>elbows</em> pointing out to each side. He&#039;s telling you that the cave is<strong> wide</strong> enough to walk through comfortably. Try playing with the form of the Kanji to draw out the pictograph I described. :).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Koos83">Koos83</a>] 1-11-2009(10): The CAVE wasn&#039;t very<strong> wide</strong>. Both my ELBOWS touched the sides.

There are so many people trying to enter in the cave at the same time! Imagine them pushing with their ELBOWS to enter first.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikedough2">mikedough2</a>] 3-1-2008(6): When spelunking, a<strong> wide</strong> <em>cave</em> is easier on the <em>elbows</em>: less likelihood of bumping into stalactites.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 30-10-2008(5): Imagine Batman inside the <em>Batcave</em> with a <em>beer in his hand</em> (pictograph) watching &quot;Gotham Knight&quot; on <strong>wide</strong>screen... (<em>continued in next kanji</em>).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rizzo">rizzo</a>] 8-11-2005(5): The <em>cave</em> is like the tokyo underground. I wish it was<strong> wide</strong>r and I wish I could get a little more <em>elbow</em> room.
