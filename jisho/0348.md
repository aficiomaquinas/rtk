## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 21-2-2007(151): The TREES<strong> FLOURISH</strong> in the CLASSROOM, a little too much perhaps, there&#039;s no room for the students any more.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois">Francois</a>] 11-3-2008(95): Students are like young trees. They tend to<strong> flourish</strong> in the schoolhouse.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 24-11-2011(53): Within the <em>schoolhouse</em>, the <em>tree</em> of knowledge does<strong> flourish</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 1-11-2007(31): Knowledge can only truly<strong> flourish</strong> when it is taught openly and freely in the <em>schoolhouse</em>, and not guarded and kept secret like the forbidden <em>tree</em> of knowledge.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 2-7-2008(30): This is a very special <em>schoolhouse</em>, were <em>trees</em> are taught how to<strong> FLOURISH</strong>. It is important to imagine the image of <em>trees</em> sitting down and taking classes on<strong> FLOURISH</strong>ING in a <em>schoolhouse</em>. You could even use an actual <em>schoolhouse</em> to make your mental image more realistic. You would even imagine the graduation ceremony of a class of sakura flowering all at the same time while holding their diplomas.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 19-4-2008(9): A <em>tree</em> in a <em>schoolhouse</em> will<strong> flourish</strong> because of the many students there to take care of it.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jupiter">Jupiter</a>] 23-11-2008(7): If you want to<strong> flourish</strong>, climb the tree of knowledge in the schoolhouse.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 16-3-2008(7): The teacher bought a lovely <em>tree</em> to brighten up the <em>schoolhouse</em>. Sadly it<strong> FLOURISH</strong>ed so well that its sharp branches poked the children, broke the windows and pushed tiles off the roof. Now the shivering children study outside in the rain, looking enviously at the tree,<strong> FLOURISH</strong>ING in the warmth.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 10-12-2007(5): Plant a <em>tree</em> in a <em>schoolhouse</em> so that it consumes CO2 and produces oxygen, allowing the kids to<strong> flourish</strong> in their learning. Don&#039;t confuse this with <a href="../2018">blossom</a> (#2018 咲).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alphador">alphador</a>] 28-1-2010(4): Anche gli studenti, come gli ALBERI, FIORISCONO, imparando cose nuove a SCUOLA.
