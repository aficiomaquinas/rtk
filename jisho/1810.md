## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 26-9-2007(283): Because <em>Asian</em> people started to eat Western food, their <em>hearts</em> became<strong> bad</strong> and they started having <em>heart</em> attacks. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 3-3-2008(121): Asian hearts are <strong>bad</strong> and <strong>evil</strong>. They invented so much martial arts: karate, judo, kungfu, muay thai, silat, etc... just to hurt each other. They torture their own people (China, North Korea). They torture other people (Japan in China and Korea). And they are able to hide all this behind their nice facade of kindness. <strong>Bad</strong>, <strong>bad</strong> Asians. (did i shatter some people&#039;s ideas on Asia? my <strong>bad</strong>). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 19-3-2006(24): In the chinese version of the music video for Michael Jackson&#039;s &quot;BAD&quot;, the performers are dancing in sync in eighties music video fashion, wearing leather jackets, chains,<strong> bad</strong> jeans, dark glasses etc. Each time Michael Jackson sings &quot;I&#039;m<strong> bad</strong>, I&#039;m<strong> bad</strong> ... you know it!&quot; they open their jackets and on their bare chests you can see a black tattoo of a heart. Which brings us to the mnemonic... <em>asian</em> <em>hearts</em> are<strong> BAD</strong> ! You know it ! 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 31-8-2010(16): Sanosuke sagara (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/るろうに剣心">るろうに剣心</a>  ) is not evil, he is just a<strong> BAD</strong>ass. <a href="http://images.quizilla.com/A/AN/ANG/angelprincess062393/1160854681_cssanosuke.jpg">http://images.quizilla.com/A/AN/ANG/angelprincess062393/1160854681_cssanosuke.jpg</a> <a href="http://images.absoluteanime.com/rurouni_kenshin/sanosuke-shirt.jpg">http://images.absoluteanime.com/rurouni_kenshin/sanosuke-shirt.jpg</a>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enryu">enryu</a>] 17-8-2009(13): (Counter Filips Argument) All human beings (Asians, Whites etc) are capable of doing<strong> bad</strong> or good its in the heart of human nature, whites are hated for invading peoples counties and stealing their lands, spreading their diseases, massacring their people almost to the point of genocide stealing the land for themselves on Australia, America, Pacific Islands, India, China etc. The crime against humanity for dropping a nuclear bomb.. unforgivable. (did i shatter some people&#039;s ideas on Whites? my<strong> bad</strong>). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jaunty">Jaunty</a>] 5-8-2009(9): Much of the <em>Asian</em> food in America is<strong> bad</strong> for your <em>heart</em> - just imagine some sodium &amp; MSG laden Chinese takeout. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 19-9-2007(8): An <em>Asian</em> stomping on a <em>heart</em> because he&#039;s &quot;<strong>BAD</strong>&quot; like Michael Jackson. Whoo! 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 21-7-2008(7): This kanji really means &quot;Evil&quot; which is quite different from &quot;bad.&quot; STORY: This kanji was really created by westerners, not ASIAN people. It&#039;s a form of propaganda, which says all ASIAN people have EVIL HEARTS. (made up story). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 13-12-2008(6): Think of all the times you&#039;ve been screwed over by Asian bitches.....they&#039;re all materialistic and have<strong> bad</strong> hearts. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Odieone">Odieone</a>] 18-1-2009(5): They say people from <em>asia</em> have a<strong> bad</strong> <em>heart</em> but thats not true.
