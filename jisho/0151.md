## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 15-7-2009(58): To keep this separated from <a href="../v4/117">sand</a> (#117 砂): <em>Water</em> erodes away stone a <em>few</em><strong> grains of sand</strong> at a time until there is no stone left.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 15-2-2007(31): Wet sand is simply sand but to see beautiful<strong> grains of sand</strong>, the <em>water</em> must be <em>few</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 22-5-2009(18): Each <em>water</em> wave washes away a <em>few</em><strong> grains of sand</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 8-10-2010(5): This kanji is used in a lot of girl’s names. 理沙 (りさ) <a href="http://google.com/#q=、沙織">、沙織</a> (さおり) <a href="http://google.com/#q=、沙百合">、沙百合</a> (さゆり). Maybe guys can think of this kind of like the classic advice there a lots of fish in <em>water</em>(ocean), lots of girls out there for you. You might think that it&#039;s hopeless and there are only <em>a few</em> girls out there, but girls are like<strong> grains of sand</strong>. Keep looking for the right one!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 15-4-2008(5): Where there are many<strong> grains of sand</strong> there are <em>few</em> drops of <em>water</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 7-4-2008(5): There needs to be <em>few</em> stones to make high-quality <a href="../v4/117">sand</a> (#117 砂), to be sure ... but what you need even <em>fewer</em> of to make the finest <strong>grains of sand</strong> is drops of <em>water</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(5): <strong>Grains of sand</strong> can only hold a <em>few</em> drops of <em>water</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 25-8-2009(3): You&#039;ll get a <em>few</em><strong> grains of sand</strong> in a mouthful of ocean <em>water</em>. The chance of it actually doing any harm is like 1 out of a 100,000,000.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 27-10-2006(2): When NASA went to Mars the first time with a probe, they did tests to see whether there was <em>water</em> present, but they couldn&#039;t even find a <em>few</em> drops of it in the<strong> grains of sand</strong> they tested.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amillerchip">amillerchip</a>] 10-1-2013(1): I renamed this to <strong>grit</strong> to avoid confusion with <a href="../v4/117">sand</a> (#117 砂). Think of the stuff that is put on roads and pavements when the weather is cold to prevent them freezing over. It only takes a <em>few drops</em> to make a difference.
