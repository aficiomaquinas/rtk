heisig: We have here a rather small <i>mouth</i> (it is always compressed when set on the left) next to a much larger piece of <i>dirt</i>. It is not hard to imagine what you might do if you got a <i>mouth</i> full of <i>dirt</i>. As least I know what I would do: <b>spit</b> it out as fast and far as I could!
