## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tweenk">Tweenk</a>] 10-3-2007(180): To maintain the social<strong> equilibrium</strong> in a future dystopian society, the <em>brains</em> of citizens are <em>bound up</em> (hypnotized). The government is using mental wave emitting statues shaped like <em>St. Bernard&#039;s dogs</em> put alongside the <em>boulevards</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 26-3-2008(165): I think BALANCE is an easier keyword. I was walking down a busy French <em>boulevard</em> when between the rushing traffic I saw the wierdest thing. BALANCING on the central crash barrier was a <em>St. Bernard dog</em>, BALANCING a <em>fish</em> on its nose. As I looked closer, I realised it was a trick; it was holding the fish&#039;s tail in its teeth, and only pretending to BALANCE it. (keeps the position of the elements!).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/boyprangko">boyprangko</a>] 20-10-2007(38): [<em>boulevard</em>... <em>bound up</em>... <em>rice field</em>... <em>large</em>...] imagine a <em>fish</em> walking a <em>boulevard</em> trying to maintain<strong> equilibrium</strong> having had its fins cut off and replaced by a <em>st. bernard</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 7-9-2007(23): The poor <em>St. Bernard</em> walking down the middle of the <em>boulevard</em> cannot see to mantain his <strong>equilibrium</strong>. It seems his <em>brain</em> is all <em>bound up</em> with alcohol.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kazelee">kazelee</a>] 25-7-2008(21): If you&#039;ve ever seen the movie<strong> Equilibrium</strong>, you know this kanji has it all. Bound minds, dogs, and building shaped like long columns enveloped by endless boulevards of soldiered surveillance. Add some imaginary gun katas and you&#039;ve got a lawsuit on your hands. If you&#039;ve never seen this movie, do, or.... CrazyWashu uses the field of<strong> equilibrium</strong> generated between Azaka and Kamidake to create a hybrid fish dog.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 28-9-2006(10): A large St Bernard dog, with a leash bound through his brains, is loosing<strong> equilibrium</strong> on the sidewalk of the boulevard.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shakkun">shakkun</a>] 12-6-2008(9): A half FISH half ST. BERNARD monstrosity walking/flopping its way down the BOULEVARD, struggling to maintain its<strong> equilibrium</strong>. (Helps me to picture it having three dog legs and one useless fin so it&#039;s constantly off-balance).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/intermu">intermu</a>] 15-11-2009(5): Imagine a <em>fish</em> being carried on top of a <em>St. Bernard</em> dog. While walking down a steep <em>boulevard</em>, the <em>St. Bernard</em> dog has to walk in <strong>equilibrium</strong> so that the <em>fish</em> doesn&#039;t fall over.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kambei">Kambei</a>] 18-5-2009(5): (THX esaulgd - change order) The poor <em>St. Bernard</em> walking down the middle of the <em>boulevard</em> cannot see to maintain his<strong> equilibrium</strong>. It seems that the <em>St. Bernard</em>&#039;s <em>brain</em> is all <em>bound up</em> with alcohol.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wheezyheen">wheezyheen</a>] 31-12-2011(4): In order to keep<strong> equilibrium</strong> or balance between city and nature, in the middle of Tokyo down the boulevard of the Yamanote line train, there is a huge park (Yoyogi park) which is like having a big field all tied up in the middle of the city.
