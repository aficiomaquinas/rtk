2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 5-3-2007(72): NOTE: do not confuse with <a href="../v4/476">compensation</a> (#476 賠)賠. However, 賠 is always used in conjunction 賠償 ... But 償 is used in various other compounds. <em>Mr. T</em> sold all his jewelry to give as<strong> reparation</strong>s to slave families. The governent tried to honor his charity by giving him a <em>prize</em>, but it was a shitty <em>outhouse filled with clams</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 16-12-2007(47): A good PERSON would use his PRIZE money to pay<strong> REPARATION</strong>S to those he harmed.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 7-11-2005(19): <strong>Reparation</strong>s are a monetary prize that people receive for being wronged or slighted in the past.

What a guy! 補償 (ほしょう) : compensation,<strong> reparation</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 11-7-2006(8): I won the <strong>prize</strong> see <a href="../v4/796">prize</a> (#796 賞). <strong>Mr. T</strong> accidentally knocked over my <strong>prize</strong>-winning <strong>outhouse</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kilioopu">kilioopu</a>] 29-1-2011(7): I knew a <em>person</em> who was clipped by a car while getting out of his own. and lost one leg. He was happy because he was paid <strong>reparations</strong> of about $10,000. He felt like he had won a <em>prize</em>. Sadly, a true story. <a href="../v4/476">compensation</a> (#476 賠) is a word the Mafia might use, and so means &quot;hush&quot; money, while <a href="../v4/985">reparation</a> (#985 償) is more legalistic and so involves insurance claims. Focus on person and not leg for left radical.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rujiel">Rujiel</a>] 18-12-2009(7): &quot;Reparations?! Those <em>people</em> just want a cash <em>prize</em> for doing nothin&#039;!&quot; (Please don&#039;t take this seriously, it was the first thing that came to mind and stuck).
