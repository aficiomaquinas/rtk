## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 26-1-2010(183): (re: Raichu) An undercover<strong> alliance</strong> between Japan (the <em>sun</em> on its flag) and Turkey (the <em>moon</em> on its flag) detected by a surveillance satellite <em>dish</em>. <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100126a3.html">http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100126a3.html</a>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 13-5-2006(86): A new<strong> alliance</strong> is proclaimed at the end of a meal between officials. As a symbol of their<strong> alliance</strong> they clean up together one <em>dish</em>, and present it to the photographers. The clean dish under the flash lights appears very <em>bright</em>, and it&#039;s pretty much all you can see on the photo that appears on the next morning&#039;s newspapers, with the title &quot;New<strong> alliance</strong>, one <em>bright dish</em>!&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Crowfoot">Crowfoot</a>] 2-6-2008(52): The <em>bright dishes</em> in the cupboard form an<strong> alliance</strong> against the others.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 18-1-2010(44): In medieval Japan (during Sengoku Jidai) there was an interesting ritual to form an<strong> alliance</strong> between different samurai clans. The warlord, who wanted to propose to form an<strong> alliance</strong> to another warlord, would send him a big ceremonial <em>dish</em> with the <em>sun</em> drawn in the center. If the proposal were accepted, the second warlord would draw an image of the <em>moon</em> next to the <em>sun</em> on the same <em>dish</em>, and then return the <em>dish</em> to the first warlord. (not true story, but helped me to create vivid image).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 1-3-2007(20): The <strong>alliance</strong> has built <em>bright</em> satellite <em>dish</em>es to defeat the rebels.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip">Ramchip</a>] 26-7-2008(18): The future of this couple&#039;s new<strong> alliance</strong> doesn&#039;t look very <em>bright</em>: they already started throwing <em>dishes</em> at eachother...

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 6-2-2008(13): Remember that old children&#039;s rhyme, about the <em>dish</em> running away with the spoon, and the cow jumping over the <em>moon</em>? Well, here we see that the <em>sun</em> and the <em>moon</em> have formed an<strong> alliance</strong> with the <em>dish</em>, to prevent nonsense shenanigans like that from taking place. The spoon and the cow are not pictured, as you can see, as the<strong> alliance</strong> has prevailed. No &quot;Hey Diddle-Diddle&quot; for them!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harkren">harkren</a>] 16-8-2009(9): The sun and moon formed an<strong> alliance</strong> to take back their precious space from the satellite dishes.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 23-12-2008(9): The rebel<strong> alliance</strong> have created a satellite <em>dish</em> capable of destroying enemies with extra-<em>bright</em> rays from space.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau23">dilandau23</a>] 15-3-2007(7): An<strong> alliance</strong> of the worlds <em>brightest</em> minds was formed to find the rest of the <em>Holy Grail</em> (See <a href="../1447">dish</a> (#1447 皿) and <a href="../1449">basin</a> (#1449 盆)). Image: Any movie scene where an<strong> alliance</strong> is formed. I use &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;.
