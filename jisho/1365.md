## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 14-4-2007(148): Spiderman has been captured and given the ultimate torture: they forced a crown of needles on his head and attached it to an electrical<strong> cord</strong>, which they are about to plug into an outlet...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shakkun">shakkun</a>] 16-6-2008(137): (modified akrodha&#039;s great story) VENOM has been captured by scientists and is being experimented on: they forced a CROWN of NEEDLES on his head and attached it to multiple electrical<strong> cord</strong>s, which are connected to a big machine.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 14-1-2008(59): An electrical<strong> cord</strong> has two (or three) prongs - <em>needles</em> - sticking out of it, a housing for the prongs that can be thought of as a <em>crown</em>, and the long <em>thread</em>-like wire leading to the appliance.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Biene">Biene</a>] 18-6-2008(47): That&#039;s <em>venom</em> for you! Since he can&#039;t make webs like spiderman can, he&#039;s now desperately hanging from a thin<strong> cord</strong> that he bought cheap in Sweden. It cost him only <em>10 Kroner</em> (Crowns). I&#039;m sure the<strong> cord</strong> will rip in a second or two. (Thanks desmidus).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 24-6-2006(31): A<strong> cord</strong> is made of <em>ten</em> <em>threads</em> <em>belted</em> together.

(the bishop&#039;s headgear is a crown with a cross on top).
