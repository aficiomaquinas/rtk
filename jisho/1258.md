## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 22-6-2007(198): Close<strong> encounter</strong>s of the third kind. The space <em>cadet</em><strong> encounter</strong>s aliens on the <em>road</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 4-12-2005(54): <em>Bender the cadet</em> (see frame 1172) has an &quot;encounter of the third kind&quot; on the <em>road</em>. Reference to Steven Spielberg&#039;s 1977 movie &quot;Close<strong> Encounter</strong>s of the Third Kind&quot;. Also a reference to popular stories of people reportedly chased by UFO&#039;s while driving on the road.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 8-1-2008(30): Close<strong> encounter</strong>s of the third kind. You<strong> encounter</strong> a space <em>cadet</em> on the <em>road</em>. (tweaked version of radical tyro&#039;s story. Having &quot;alien&quot; in the story made me want to use 玄 in place of 曹 ).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 26-11-2008(20): You<strong> encounter</strong> cadets on the road as they march &quot;hut 2-3-4&quot; (frame 1173).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thelooseteeth">thelooseteeth</a>] 10-3-2009(11): While traveling the Milky <em>road-way</em>, <em>Bender the space cadet</em> had an alien <em>encounter</em>. However, he&#039;s used to them by now, so it wasn&#039;t really a big deal.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 11-5-2010(6): The chubby cadet from the last frame has more trouble when he<strong> encounter</strong>s an ice cream truck on the road.<strong> Encounter</strong> makes me think RPG, so I picture the chubby cadet walking along and then suddenly zooming into a fight screen with the Ice Cream truck on the other side. The Ice Cream Truck&#039;s attack is called &quot;Tempting deliciousness&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Beneus">Beneus</a>] 9-11-2008(4): A random<strong> encounter</strong>! The <em>space cadet bender</em> meets his first enemies while flying around. What a surprise, as he thought those only happened while walking on the <em>roads</em> of the world map. You&#039;re usually safe while in a vehicle.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 12-9-2007(4): Close<strong> Encounter</strong>. You&#039;re driving along <em>Mario Kart Road</em>, in the midst of a heated race, when you see <em>Cadet</em> <em>Bender</em> swoop down (looking for his <em>one</em> <em>sun</em> to blow up). He brings you onto the ship, examines you, and eventually decides against destroying you. He drops you off just outside the racetrack, kart and all. The only evidence you have of your<strong> encounter</strong> is a brand on your arm that says &quot;<em>Cadet Bender</em> Wuz Here&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 30-4-2008(3): In the late stages of the war, one was more likiely to<strong> encounter</strong> cadets on the road than seasoned soldiers.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 3-8-2006(3): Military training is hard. A <em>cadet</em> will<strong> encounter</strong> much hardship along the <em>way</em>.
