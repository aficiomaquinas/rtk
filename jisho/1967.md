## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 4-9-2008(174): For the <em>condor</em> primitive: A <strong>condor</strong> is like a <em>vulture</em>, but <em>twice</em> as big and it lives near <em>mountains</em> (a suitable place for such a majestic bird). For<strong> swing</strong>: I&#039;m sitting on a<strong> swing</strong> when a <em>condor</em> comes by and picks up the whole<strong> swing</strong> set with its big <em>finger</em>-like claws and now I&#039;m<strong> swing</strong>ing in mid-air. Weeeeeeeee!!!!!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 15-6-2007(141): I keep<strong> swing</strong>ing gleefuly on the talons of the <em>soaring condor</em> until he slices off my <em>fingers</em> and sends me plummeting.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 8-2-2008(27): I don&#039;t recommend using king as a primitive for condor, the stroke order is wrong. Vulture Dry Mountain or even Vulture Two Mountains should work better.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 31-3-2008(22): This kanji is for <strong>tremors</strong> and <strong>shakes</strong>. It perfectly illustrates the good ol&#039; joke of <strong>shaking</strong> a beverage <em>tin can</em> in your <em>fingers</em>. And then laugh when another person opens the can with his/her <em>nails</em> (claws) and gets totally soaked! (<em>Tin can</em> loses the left stroke because it has no pull tab).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 18-3-2008(13): I am sure you have heard this on the trains in Japan: <a href="midori://search?text=「これから揺れますので、ご注意ください」">「これから揺れますので、ご注意ください」</a> So imagine that the train does<strong> SWING</strong> and SHAKE. This gives ちかん&#039;s the opportunity to pretend like they fell and grab a feel on a nearby girl like a CONDOR would with their claws.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/channi">channi</a>] 30-4-2009(12): Primitive for condor: Condors are vultures that live on dry mountains.<strong> SWING</strong> by your fingers from a flying condor. It&#039;s lots of fun!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-5-2008(7): Okay, vultures, flock of birds - Condor is a mistake (for me). So I am thinking of using a <em>Ropeway/Skyride</em> (see here <a href="http://www.chairlift.org/disneyland.html">http://www.chairlift.org/disneyland.html</a> - the old Disneyland ride!) - <em>two</em> strings set up between <em>two</em> <em>mountains</em>. You ride on little trams shaped like <em>vultures</em>. <em>Fingers</em> the thief sneaks onto <em>Skyride</em> and is trying to steal some wallets. They refuse, until he starts to<strong> swing</strong> the ride (anyone ever had a friend do that? scary!) - which terrifies them, and they give up their money.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 2-10-2007(7): <em>Condors</em> are like <em>vultures</em> that fly over really <em>dry montains</em>. The <em>condor</em> decides to<strong> swing</strong> by <em>Shrek&#039;s</em> house to play on the<strong> swing</strong>s with him.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tornadic_Indignation">Tornadic_Indignation</a>] 1-8-2009(6): (dumb, but i&#039;ll be using the primitive &quot;can opener&quot; instead of &quot;condor&quot; since birds are starting to annoy me) I<strong> swing</strong> the <em>can opener</em> around my finger <em>trying</em> to be cool and stuff, but everyone laughs at me. !@#$ers.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 14-8-2006(6): A condor wants to<strong> swing</strong> on a<strong> swing</strong> set, but since he only has wings and not fingers, it&#039;s hard for him to hang on and he keeps falling off. If only he had fingers, he thinks.
