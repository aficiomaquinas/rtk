## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 9-3-2011(224): There&#039;s a tendency in Japan to make the younger members (kouhai) clean up after the older members (senpai) of a group, which results in a lot of grumbling and whining. &quot;Well<strong> old boy</strong>,&quot; a senpai might say, &quot;If you did as much work with the <em>mop</em> as you do with your <em>mouth,</em> you would have been done an hour ago&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stefanot">stefanot</a>] 22-1-2007(69): The Beatles, english<strong> old boy</strong>s, had hairs like <em>mop</em> and a good singing <em>mouth</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru">raseru</a>] 6-4-2008(46): 君 [kimi] is said by the<strong> old boy</strong> to the younger boy, never the other way around as it would be an insult.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 11-1-2008(32): For this character I think of the Korean movie &quot;<strong>oldboy</strong>&quot;, in which the protagonist has hair like a <em>mop</em> and a <em>mouth</em> that screams in agony. If you have not seen it you really should it&#039;s great, I won&#039;t spoil the ending...you won&#039;t see it coming :).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 18-4-2009(22): 君 [kimi] is said by the<strong> old boy</strong> to the younger boy, otherwise it would be an insult and someone would end up with a <em>mop</em> to the <em>mouth</em>. (Thank you Raseru).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep">pazustep</a>] 2-8-2008(19): Don&#039;t address me as 君 , you<strong> old boy</strong>! For you it&#039;s 様 , or I&#039;ll <em>mop</em> your <em>mouth</em>!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Machine_Gun_Cat">Machine_Gun_Cat</a>] 28-2-2009(11): A few of you Japanese veterans may find it more helpful to attach the meaning of きみ　to this Kanji when using it as a primitive.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 18-11-2008(10): <strong>Old boy</strong>s are so arrogant I want to shove a <em>mop</em> in their <em>m0uths</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 14-5-2007(7): Huge <em>mop</em>-like mustaches cover the <em>mouths</em> of many Southern <strong>good ol&#039; boys</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 18-1-2008(5): Have you ever seen one of those <strong>old boys</strong> in Japan that eat <em>spaghetti</em> by raising the <em>fork</em> over their head and placing their <em>mouth</em> under the pasta? It always looked strange to me, used to eat in plates.
