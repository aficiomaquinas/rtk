heisig: "Unless you are a botanist, you are not likely to know what a <b>Japanese Judas-tree</b> looks like, and probably never even heard of it before, but the name is sufficiently odd to make remembering it easy. Using the primitives as our guide, we define it as a <i>tree</i> with <i>ivy</i> growing down its branches in the shape of a hangman's rope."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 26-1-2006(158): Simple mnemonic : &quot;The<strong> Japanese Judas-tree</strong> is the <em>tree</em> on which Judas hang himself to the <em>ivy</em>&quot; (Judas the traitor of the Christian bible). Just picture Judas hanging himself, using <em>ivy</em> as a if it was a rope. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 6-1-2008(92): A <em>tree</em> covered in poison <em>ivy</em> will quickly betray you, thus the name<strong> JAPANESE JUDAS-TREE</strong>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix">kaminix</a>] 2-3-2008(35): The <strong>Katsura</strong> (<strong>Japanese Judas-tree</strong>) is a thin <em>tree</em> (sort of like the stretched out   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/木">木</a>   used in this kanji) with little green (the color of an emerald, a <em>jewel</em>) leaves. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsura_">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsura_</a>(tree). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 4-8-2008(15): Japanese JEWEL TREE sounds like JUDAS-tree. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 28-3-2007(13): Interesting... this tree is called a かつら (Katura) Tree in Japan. It got the<strong> Japanese Judas-Tree</strong> distinction because it bears a similar leaf-type to the Judas Tree found in Europe and such. For fun word-play with both the Judas &amp; Katsura distinctions... it might be good to learn that a homonym for Katsura (w/different Kanji 鬘) is a hairpiece or wig! So now imagine some dishevled business man with a funny hairpiece stringing ivy around the Katsura/Judas tree to hang himself with!! 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Chrysostym">Chrysostym</a>] 20-3-2009(7): The Japanese Judas TREE grows SQUARE JEWEL leaves. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alphador">alphador</a>] 19-4-2010(5): Un&#039;ALBERO con una corda d&#039;EDERA per impiccarsi che pende dai rami, è L&#039;ALBERO GIAPPONESE DI GIUDA. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oohansel">oohansel</a>] 21-4-2009(5): The<strong> Japanese Judas-tree</strong> is a TREE with a SQUARED JEWEL. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63">ashman63</a>] 25-3-2008(4): A<strong> Japanese Judas-tree</strong> is a <em>tree</em> with <em>ivy</em> hanging off it.
