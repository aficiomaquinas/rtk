2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 1-12-2009(90): Note: <em>meeting of butchers + heart</em> are later combined into 愈 <a href="../v4/2433">in the nick of time</a> (#2433 愈). Story: For<strong> healing</strong> to take place, you must catch the <em>sickness in the nick of time</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hinode">Hinode</a>] 22-3-2009(61): (Think rpg!) We were in dire need of<strong> healing</strong>. Our party was fighting the <em>cavemen</em>, but we didn&#039;t fare too well. It was more like a <em>butcher&#039;s meeting</em> than a fight... just as they were about to pierce my <em>heart</em>, luckily a priest came along and used his<strong> healing</strong> spell <a href="../v4/2433">in the nick of time</a> (#2433 愈).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 12-7-2009(31): <strong>Healing</strong> from <em>sickness</em> often comes just <a href="../v4/2433">in the nick of time</a> (#2433 愈), especially during boss battles.

They had just discovered that cow&#039;s <em>hearts</em> have magic<strong> healing</strong> properties that can cure all <em>sickness</em>. They must come up with a new pricing strategy before the media hears about this!
