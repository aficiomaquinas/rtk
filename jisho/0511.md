## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 19-7-2007(385): This <em>house</em> is reserved to<strong> V.I.P.</strong> only. If you are not <em>one of the few</em> with enough <em>money</em> to call you that way, keep out!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bendyarm">bendyarm</a>] 4-10-2007(51): The<strong> V.I.P.</strong> visits your <em>house</em>, but your <em>ceiling</em> is too low for his inflated head, which he bumps and hurts. You have to give him your <em>few</em> <em>shells</em> as compensation.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/afefer">afefer</a>] 25-2-2010(5): If you&#039;re a <strong>V.I.P.</strong>, you&#039;re <em>one</em> of the <em>few</em> with a <em>house</em> and a lot of <em>money</em>.

All of a sudden a large part of the <em>ceiling</em> comes collapsing down. &quot;Like, that sucks,&quot; Paris says. &quot;I&#039;d, like, offer to pay for a new <em>ceiling</em> for your family and stuff, but unfortunately I only have, like, a <em>few</em> <em>shells</em>.&quot;.
