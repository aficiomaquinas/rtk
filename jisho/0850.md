## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 31-3-2008(241): The <strong>storehouse</strong> is <em>overgrown</em> with <em>slaves</em>. The <em>slaves</em> are to be sold in the store, to differentiate from a warehouse, which doesn&#039;t have the word &quot;store&quot; in it. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shimouma">shimouma</a>] 21-4-2008(96): Slaves moved flowers from the<strong> storehouse</strong> in preparation for the parade. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hknamida">hknamida</a>] 2-9-2007(44): For this story, I have chosen to use <em>overgrown</em> as an enclosure. The <em>slaves</em>, who are treated as objects rather than human beings, are denied the luxury of living in a proper house. Rather, they are stuffed in the <em>overgrown</em> <strong>storehouse</strong> with their owner&#039;s other possessions. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(23): Slaves are being paraded, decorated with flowers in a rather ironic attempt of making them look happy in order to attract buyers. After the parade they are put back into the<strong> storehouse</strong>. -<strong> STOREHOUSE</strong> (for temporary preservation), storeroom. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/imojyochu">imojyochu</a>] 24-8-2008(11): The Romans wearing <em>flower</em> garlands had a victory <em>parade</em> in which the captured Slaves were moved to a<strong> STOREHOUSE</strong>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yozora">Yozora</a>] 29-5-2009(10): FLOWERS were moved to the<strong> storehouse</strong> by a PARADE of SLAVES. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 8-1-2008(9): Not the warehouse with the batmobile. The<strong> storehouse</strong> is not filled with soon-to-be-used wares, but is instead filled with infrequently used supplies for emergencies. It&#039;s so infrequently used that it&#039;s overgrown. And it&#039;s so big (filled with infrequently-used supplies) that you need a bunch of slaves to run around and find/retrieve stuff - it&#039;s far too large for one person to cover on foot alone. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rujiel">Rujiel</a>] 12-12-2009(5): The <em><a href="../360">overgrown</a> <span class="index">(#360 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/茂">茂</a>)</span> flower parade</em> hides <em>slaves</em>--a<strong> storehouse</strong> full of them, in fact. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Onikagii">Onikagii</a>] 21-7-2009(4): I picture the movie Gladiator here when Maximus returned to Rome triumphant and they had a giant parade. Imagine the long long line of slaves carry all the flowers from the<strong> storehouse</strong>s to the parade route to be thrown at the feet of Maximus. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/slats70">slats70</a>] 15-11-2008(4): A <em>slave</em> sneaks into the <em>overgrown</em><strong> storehouse</strong> to find some food.
