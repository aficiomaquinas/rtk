heisig: What we mentioned in the previous two frames about 3 of something meaning "everywhere" or "heaps of" was not meant to be taken lightly. In this kanji we see <i>two suns</i>, one atop the other, which, if we are not careful, is easily confused in memory with the <i>three suns</i> of <i>sparkle</i>. Focus on the number this way: since we speak of <b>prosperous</b> times as <i>sunny</i>, what could be more <b>prosperous</b> than a sky with <i>two suns</i> in it? Just be sure to actually SEE them there.
