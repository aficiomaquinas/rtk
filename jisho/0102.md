heisig: "If one is asked to think of associations for the word <b>pierce</b>, among the first to come to mind is that of <b>piercing</b> one's ears to hold earrings, a quite primitive form of self-mutilation that has survived into the 21st century. The kanji here is read, top to bottom: <i>mama</i> . . . <i>oyster</i>. All you need to do is imagine <b>piercing</b> an ear so that it can hold a mother-of-pearl (actually, a <i>mama</i>-of-pearl) you have just wrested from an <i>oyster</i>."

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiddle">fiddle</a>] 15-6-2006(17): Tip: this kanji is associated with the idea of carrying through with one&#039;s original intentions / holding onto one&#039;s true principles. I use James Heisig&#039;s story but also think of the piercing pushing through despite meeting with resistance (also means 3.75kg).
