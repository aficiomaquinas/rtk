## Koohii stories:

So they had a <em>clock</em> built into it that would measure how long each one played it. That way they could be sure none played it more than othe other.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MRT88">MRT88</a>] 14-12-2009(10): Two <em>kings</em> were fighting over a beautiful koto (harp). So they had a <em>clock</em> built into it that would measure how long each one played it. That way they could be sure none played it more than othe other.<em> (It helps me to remember that the kings are sitting atop the giant floor clock staring down in anticipation. for placement)</em>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 8-3-2007(7): This is actually the kanji for <strong>koto</strong>. I pictute two mallets with <em>jeweled</em> heads beating on a <strong>koto</strong> in time to a metronome (<em>clock</em>). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 18-4-2008(6): I just had the newest artificial balls installed into my scrotum! They even have a built-in clock and chime every hour with the sound of a<strong> harp</strong>! The ladies love &#039;em... 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Groot">Groot</a>] 24-4-2010(4): I think of the Marienplatz in Munich, which features <em>two kings</em> over a <em>clock</em> making music on a glockenspiel, which looks vaguely like a koto, which is what Heisig presumably has in mind with <strong>harp</strong>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 4-3-2009(4): <strong>Harp</strong> players usually hold a <em>clock</em> between their legs, like nestled in their <em>balls</em>, to secretly check the time without the conductor yelling at them. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sdrobertm">sdrobertm</a>] 17-2-2011(3): Two kings<strong> harp</strong>ing over whose turn it is to play the<strong> harp</strong> now. &quot;It&#039;s my turn now.&quot; &quot;No, it&#039;s not. You played last. It&#039;s my turn now.&quot;. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/firebound12">firebound12</a>] 13-12-2008(3): <em>Two kings</em> in two different kingdom wanted the<strong> harp</strong> lady to play a song for them at the same time and the<strong> harp</strong> lady accepted both request. When it was time for the play, both kings were looking at their <em>clock</em> and wondering why the<strong> harp</strong> lady was late for the performance. But the<strong> harp</strong> lady didn&#039;t go to either of them because she wanted to teach a lesson to those kings that they can&#039;t have everything <em>now</em>.
