## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimsublimeman">jimsublimeman</a>] 4-12-2007(225): The <em>cavern refugees</em> are so poor that they can&#039;t afford thermometers. So, the menfolk expose their <em>crotches</em> inside the cavern, and approximate the temperature in<strong> degrees</strong> from how shrivelled everything looks downstairs...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 3-5-2008(64): The cave is twenty<strong> degrees</strong> cooler than the outdoors. Twenty male crotches experience shrinkage.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epsilondelta">epsilondelta</a>] 14-12-2009(62): PRIMITIVE: <em>Cave</em> + <em>twenty</em> = <strong>Finnish sauna</strong> (instead of Heisig&#039;s &quot;caverns&quot;, which I&#039;d confuse with &quot;cave&quot;). STORY: When it gets 95<strong> degrees</strong> Celsius (or 200<strong> degrees</strong> Fahrenheit) in the <em>sauna</em>, you start feeling the heat in your <em>crotch</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 20-12-2005(32): You might want to pick a seat in the <em>cavern</em> a little closer to the cooking fire, though. Otherwise, the second you sit down on the cold rocks, the temperature of your <em>crotch</em> will drop about fifty<strong> degrees</strong>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 8-2-2008(15): (Continuing story from previous kanji - thanks matticus) One of the commoners has no towel. As soon as he sits down on the cold rocks of the <em>caverns</em>, the temperature of his <em>crotch</em> drops about fifty<strong> degrees</strong>!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(9): [epsilondelta&#039;s keyword: cave + twenty = sauna] My story: A boy and a girl are sitting in a <em>sauna</em>. &quot;Wow, it&#039;s 95 <strong>degrees</strong> in here! I&#039;m getting really wet here (obviously referring to her sweating),&quot; says the girl. The boy can&#039;t help but send a quick glance towards the girl&#039;s <em>crotch</em>, and he says &quot;Yeah, that&#039;s...that&#039;s hot. So hot.&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 6-3-2007(8): The goblins in their <em>caverns</em> measure each goblin&#039;s <em>crotch</em>. The <strong>degree</strong> to which it is inclined is used to determine his rank and status.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 19-5-2008(7): The <em>cavern</em> that is a woman&#039;s <em>crotch</em> stays pretty warm. Maybe about <em>twenty</em><strong> degrees</strong> higher than room temperature.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/phantombk201">phantombk201</a>] 1-9-2010(6): The cave/cavern is 20<strong> degrees</strong> below zero and your crotch is freezing.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Atomik">Atomik</a>] 25-2-2010(5): These <em>caverns</em> get colder the deeper I go into them. With every couple<strong> degrees</strong> of temperature drop, I can feel my <em>crotch</em> shrinking.
