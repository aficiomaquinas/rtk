Well imagine being<strong> sandwiched</strong> in so tight, that when the doors close, only your FINGERS are sticking out. The train staff have no choice... they must cut them off with SCISSORS =( snip snip..

So now, Japan has hired Edward scissorhands to cut off the fingers of the offenders. Being<strong> sandwiched</strong> together is no excuse for chikan!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 24-7-2008(5): For the radical on the right, I suggest using <em>zipper</em> instead of <em>scissors</em> (chosen by Heisig merely because it slighty looks like one). Imagining <strong>sandwiched</strong> <em>fingers</em> in a <em>zipper</em>-like fashion is so easy it doesn&#039;t need more details.
