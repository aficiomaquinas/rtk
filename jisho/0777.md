## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 30-4-2006(250): <strong>Storm</strong> is a full-blown wind that rips the mountains off the ground (you see one flying here).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 16-1-2006(76): <em>Winds</em> are gathering at the base of the <em>mountain</em> (note the hint to primitive placement), going up, and turning into a huge mountain<strong> storm</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 5-11-2007(73): What a<strong> storm</strong>! Even a <em>mountain</em> was carried off by the <em>wind</em>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 21-2-2007(15): A<strong> storm</strong> is <em>winds</em> strong enough to lift a <em>mountain</em>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 9-4-2009(6): You are sitting on top of Fuji, enjoying spectacular view of the<strong> storm</strong> below.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 26-1-2007(6): <strong>Storm</strong> from X-men must save her team! She creates a strong<strong> storm</strong>, with winds so powerful it lifts up an entire mountain and crushes the enemies.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyreia">Hyreia</a>] 12-4-2009(5): I agree with what one person said (Sorry I can&#039;t remember who you are). When a mountain is on top like this it means a dramatically more powerful version of whatever is at the bottom. If you learn a little about how<strong> storm</strong>s are made, you would know it&#039;s from the same source as wind: warm air and cold air. Warm air has all of this energy, and when it cools it can&#039;t hold all of that energy and it has to go somewhere: thunder and lightning. (In a nutshell, I&#039;m sure I butchered that, but the idea still holds.).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Izumo">Izumo</a>] 31-3-2010(4): A <em>storm</em> is like a <em>mountain</em> of <em>wind</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 27-3-2011(3): When I&#039;m up in the <em>mountains</em>, I have to pay attention to the wind...it may be bringing a<strong> storm</strong>. 嵐 あらし<strong> storm</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rowdyphantom">rowdyphantom</a>] 6-5-2010(3): The<strong> storm</strong> rises up like a <em>mountain</em> on the <em>wind</em>.
