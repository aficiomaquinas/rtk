They were protesting the harsh treatment they get every<strong> year-end</strong> when Santa asks them to step up toy production for the holiday season. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/khooks">khooks</a>] 10-2-2007(100): At the<strong> year-end</strong>, everything seems to come to a <em>stop</em>. However, there&#039;s still enough time for a <em>little march</em> to celebrate. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 3-1-2008(45): At<strong> year-end</strong>, we <em>stop</em> for a <em>small</em> celebration before <em>marching</em> ahead into the new year. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cezpeleta">cezpeleta</a>] 6-11-2009(22): At<strong> year-end</strong>, STOP and celebrate with a LITTLE MARCH. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly">uchifly</a>] 11-6-2009(14): Every<strong> YEAR-END</strong>, its important to STOP and have ONE LITTLE PARADE to celebrate.

Imagine traffic STOPPED to allow a MARCH of LITTLE kids in caps and gowns to cross the road like ducklings at the <strong>end of the (school) year</strong>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 11-10-2008(8): At the<strong> year-end</strong>, everything comes to a <em>stop</em>. Even the <em>Grim Reaper</em> is going to relax a tiny <em>little</em> bit.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BBoyle">BBoyle</a>] 1-1-2010(6): This Kanji has a lot in common with Auld Lang Syne. It shares the same message, stop marching forward and reflect upon the little important things a the years end. &quot;Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind ?&quot; Even moreso it matches the song&#039;s steps. After the singers are done with the last verse from a complete stop they march a few steps forward and back. Just remember the dance steps and you remember this Kanji! 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blueraccoon">blueraccoon</a>] 12-1-2009(6): The <em>footprints</em> left by the <em>march</em> of <em>little</em> wooden soldiers around the Christmas tree and back to their home in cardboard boxes marks the<strong> year-end</strong>.
