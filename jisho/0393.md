heisig: "The key word of course calls to mind the feast of Christmas. As the famous poem at the start of St. John's gospel tells us, the <b>nativity</b> we celebrate at Christmas had its origins at the very start of time and governs all of human history: it represents the <i>prolongation</i> of the eternal <i>Word</i> in time and space."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 8-1-2008(207): <strong>Nativity</strong> = born, being born. Think of <strong>birth</strong> as a painful and <em>prolong</em>ed event. And of course, all the <em>words</em> and curses being yelled at the soon-to-be father for doing this to her! 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 15-6-2009(173): When you are being born ( <strong>nativity</strong> ), your mother&#039;s WORDS are PROLONGED. (Thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis huuuuuuuuuuuuuurtss a lottttttttt~!! Owwwwwww!!!). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63">ashman63</a>] 7-4-2008(105): The<strong> nativity</strong> story: A child born to a virgin mother? Sounds to me like the <em>words</em> have <em>stretch</em>ed what is sensibly <em>correct</em>. Sadly, those <em>words</em> have continued to be spread through the <em>prolonged</em> use of the bible. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei">javiergakusei</a>] 17-4-2007(61): At<strong> Nativity</strong> (christmas), the priest says more Words (sermon) than the rest of the time, Prolonging mass duration. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 16-6-2008(34):   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/誕生日">誕生日</a>   【たんじょうび】 (n) birthday; (P)   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/誕生石">誕生石</a>   【たんじょうせき】 (n) a birthstone STORY: On your BIRTHDAY people say WORDS of good luck and fortune to PROLONG your life. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 29-3-2009(17): I hate the<strong> nativity</strong> play. The kids make so many mistakes and keep screwing up their <em>words</em>, <em>proling</em>ing my misery. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 5-2-2009(16): NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. <strong>Nativity</strong>; the <em>word</em> <em>prolonged</em>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 17-10-2009(15): When Jesus was being born (<strong>nativity</strong>), the virgin Mary&#039;s <em>words</em> were <em>prolonged</em>. &quot;Fuuuuuuuuuuuck!!&quot; (thanks crystalcastlecreature). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rosgmact">rosgmact</a>] 21-8-2007(11): &quot;The <em>Word</em> became flesh and dwelt among us.&quot; So says John&#039;s Gospel, but how much do we know of the historical Jesus and what facts can truly be established about him? What of the famous<strong> Nativity</strong>? Should we doubt the veracity of the Angels and the Magi? While fundamentalist Christians are entitled to their faith and views, it is quite uncontroversial among biblical scholars that the <em>words</em> of the Gospels have, to put it mildly, <em>stretched</em> the <em>truth</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brainrobert1">brainrobert1</a>] 3-9-2010(10): Say + prolong =<strong> nativity</strong> Joseph SAID to Mary: Let&#039;s PROLONG the<strong> nativity</strong> so the Three Wise Men can get here in time.
