heisig: "The key word of course calls to mind the feast of Christmas. As the famous poem at the start of St. John's gospel tells us, the <b>nativity</b> we celebrate at Christmas had its origins at the very start of time and governs all of human history: it represents the <i>prolongation</i> of the eternal <i>Word</i> in time and space."
