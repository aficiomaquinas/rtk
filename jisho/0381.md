heisig: "To the many definitions for <b>politics</b> that already exist, this character offers yet another: <i>correct taskmastering</i>. Think about what the primitives tell us. On the one hand, we see the pessimistic wisdom that <b>politics</b> has to do with <i>taskmastering</i>, maneuvering people with or without their will. And on the other, we see the campaign assurances that this duty can be performed <i>correctly</i> if only the right candidate is given a chance."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nagisa">nagisa</a>] 19-5-2007(219): Those involved in<strong> politics</strong> are always trying to elect the <em>correct</em> <em>taskmaster</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cosby">cosby</a>] 16-7-2008(189): Insane political <em>correctness</em> on the left, and facists <em>taskmasters</em> on the right- thats<strong> politics</strong> in a nutshell right there. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtstutz">dtstutz</a>] 5-5-2008(23): The Left is careful to be politically correct in speech. The Right whips people into a frenzy of outrage! 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 14-10-2008(14): Insane political <em>correctness</em> on the left, and a fascist <em>Hitler</em> on the right – thats<strong> politics</strong> in a nutshell right there. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pangolin">Pangolin</a>] 3-10-2006(8): I like immacolata&#039;s &quot;chief whip&quot; (helps if you are British!) as <em>taskmaster</em>. But let us not forget <strong>policital</strong> <em>correct</em>ness. The <em>taskmaster</em> (chief whip) is there to see that party members observe <strong>political</strong> <em>correct</em>ness at all times, especially in a socialist party, <em>correct</em>ness is on the left!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 16-2-2006(5): Party<strong> Politics</strong> is all about having the party members act <em>correct</em> and follow doctrine in voting, which is done by a senior party <em>taskmaster</em>, also called the chief whip. Mnemonic: <em>corrected</em> by the <em>taskmaster</em>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richizy">richizy</a>] 20-4-2012(4): <strong>Politics</strong> really boils down to electing the <em>correct taskmaster</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mdspencer">mdspencer</a>] 25-6-2010(4): The <em>correct</em> <em>taskmaster</em> rarely enters<strong> politics</strong>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alatown">alatown</a>] 22-7-2009(4): Political correctness is a b1tch.
