## Heisig story:

Mount . . . saber.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adhmm">adhmm</a>] 25-11-2007(188): Mount everest is very<strong> sturdy</strong>, you can hit it all day with a saber and it wont even wobble.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samusam">samusam</a>] 17-2-2008(54): Anything<strong> sturdy</strong> in Japan is associated with <em>Mount</em> Fuji. Perhaps this is because it&#039;s symmetry is believed to make it rather<strong> sturdy</strong> itself, unlike all those crooked mountains that are around and tend to fall apart (think rock slides, avalanches, etc.). Here we see<strong> Sturdy</strong>-brand <em>sabers</em> with <em>Mount</em> Fuji engraved on the blade.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 5-1-2007(31): This is the full character for<strong> sturdy</strong>, to which saber is added as an example of a<strong> sturdy</strong> thing. (the true etymology of 岡鋼綱剛 is a bit more messy, but I don&#039;t really care, this way it&#039;s easy to remember, and isn&#039;t far from the truth anyway).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 26-5-2009(15): Remember the sword in the stone. This is the <em>saber</em> in the top of <em>Mt ---</em>. It&#039;s so<strong> sturdy</strong> almost no one can pull it out.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 20-7-2007(12): The most<strong> sturdy</strong> <em>sabers</em> are made on<strong> sturdy</strong> <em>Mount</em> Fuji.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nexirae">nexirae</a>] 11-6-2009(8): The SABERS formed in MOUNT DOOM are<strong> sturdy</strong> ones.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko">Nuriko</a>] 14-4-2008(6): You may have guessed, but if S&amp;M goat has thighs of steel, a certain &quot;saber&quot; of his is most likely quite<strong> sturdy</strong> too... especially when in the process of mounting.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 5-1-2010(3): This is also used as a man&#039;s name, for example Kusanagi <strong>Tsuyoshi</strong>, the SMAP guy who was arrested for dancing around in a park by himself, drunk and in the nude. His reputation is<strong> sturdy</strong> like <em>Mount</em> Fuji -- he&#039;s still on tv even though he got caught with his <em>saber</em> out... 草なぎ 剛 [くさなぎ つよし].

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 12-5-2008(3): Mount Glassgoat&#039;s steel (frame 1962) makes<strong> sturdy</strong> sabres.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 21-12-2008(2): Forged in the depths of <em>Mount</em> Doom, the One Ring is<strong> sturdy</strong> enough to withstand blows from any <em>saber</em>.
