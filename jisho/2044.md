## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 17-7-2007(256): When an enemy&#039;s <em>flag</em> is raised, a true <em>samurai</em> can <em>split</em> it in half with just his<strong> voice</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bananarama">bananarama</a>] 2-3-2008(65): Having lost his<strong> voice</strong>, the samurai comunicated to his troops with a striped flag.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 30-7-2009(53): The lower element is easier to remember as: <em>venetian mask with stick</em>. Story: During carnival time you try to guess who is that <em>gentleman</em> hiding his face under <em>venetian mask with stick</em>. You definetely heard his<strong> voice</strong> before.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-4-2007(23): The <em>samurai</em> stepped on his <em>Rubik&#039;s Cube</em> and <em>bent</em> it. His <strong>voice</strong> of pain and grief rang out.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jcdietz03">jcdietz03</a>] 29-8-2010(12): In ancient Japan, after winning a battle, a SAMURAI might rip the opposing FLAG down the middle (represented by the vertical line of flag) and bellow a victory cry in his loudest<strong> VOICE</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 31-12-2007(6): The samurai stands above a flag, places his walking stick on it and prepares his<strong> voice</strong> to give a rousing speech.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 8-8-2006(4): How about taking the lower bit as a bent mosaic? the SAMURAI&#039;s<strong> voice</strong> was so powerful that as he was bellowing the MOSAIC wall was BENT backwards.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/effer">effer</a>] 16-4-2012(3): You call with your<strong> voice</strong> 10 times, then you get impatient and split the door in half.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 27-10-2006(3): If we think of the lower part as a bent Mosaic (thanks ergerg!), then we can think of that as the Firefox web browser (since Mosaic it sort of it&#039;s ancestor, and the modern web browser does much more than render pages, so in some sense it&#039;s <em>bent</em> from the original simple philosophy). Here we see a modern samurai <strong>voicing</strong> his opinion online using the Firefox browser.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 11-6-2006(3): The <em>samurai</em> uses special semafor <em>flags</em> to communicate instead of his<strong> voice</strong>.
