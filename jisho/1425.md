## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 20-2-2006(183): A pictograph of a japanese schoolgirl getting<strong> grope</strong>d by perverts on the train. The <em>fingers</em> of course, a <em>crown</em> (her too short skirt) and her <em>legs</em> below (which to be honest are pretty thick like <em>tree</em> trunks).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 6-1-2012(121): Note: &quot;<em>crown+human legs</em>&quot; appears 7 times in RTK. In 4 cases (nos. 323, 1327, 1328, 2920) <em>crown</em> is above <em>human legs</em>, and in the other 3 (1888, 2472, 2679) one leg passes through the crown. I call the 1st pattern &quot;<em>Miss World</em>&quot; (who is wearing a <em>crown</em> &amp; has long <em>human legs</em>) and the 2nd &quot;<em>garter</em>&quot; (one <em>human leg</em> passes through the <em>crown</em> wearing it as a <em>garter</em>). Story: <em>Miss World</em> has climbed a <em>tree</em> to avoid the <em>finger</em> that was <strong>groping</strong> for her. ( 探 means &quot;grope for&quot;, i.e. search).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 31-5-2008(69): (based on gorgon&#039;s story) a pictograph of a japanese schoolgirl getting<strong> grope</strong>d by perverts on the train. The <em>fingers</em> of course, a <em>crown</em> (her too short skirt) and her <em>legs</em> below. It&#039;s her own fault for wearing such a short skirt and causing the perverts to get <em>wood</em>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 4-12-2006(57): I don&#039;t know why, but this is a pictograph of someone groping about in the dark (with his fingers, obviously) for his beloved wooden paper punch.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 17-1-2008(39): As esaulgd said, this kanji DOES NOT mean &quot;touch&quot; like <a href="midori://search?text=触る。">触る。</a> Here is my story: Imagine a blind detective who must<strong> GROPE</strong> for answers in by reading old police reports. But because he is blind, he must use brail books, you know, the ones that have been PAPER PUNCHED on PAPER (wood). Naturally, he uses his FINGERS for this.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 18-3-2009(21): <em>Miss World</em> (see Katsuo&#039;s note) is hiding on a <em>tree</em> because she is afraid of some pervert trying to<strong> grope</strong> her with his <em>fingers</em> of course.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyreia">Hyreia</a>] 12-4-2009(20): [+gorgon] A pervert is on a train <strong>groping</strong> up a <em>Japanese&#039;s school girl&#039;s too short skirt</em> (the crown+legs) with his <em>fingers</em> ... but what he was <strong>groping</strong> for he doesn&#039;t find, instead he finds a huge <em>tree</em>! Oh snap! ...I don&#039;t want to go into details, but I imagine &quot;she&quot; gets revenge. &gt;&gt; (Fixed story so it means &#039;to search for&#039;. ).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 3-8-2006(14): <strong>Fingers</strong>, the thief, has never gone in for this crime before! He is tempted to <strong>grope</strong> a Japanese <strong>school girl</strong> on the train. He barely gets started when she draws out a whole <strong>tree</strong> from beneath her little skirt and whacks him over the head! Ow!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meredithcat">meredithcat</a>] 12-8-2010(10): (Note: This kanji also means &quot;look for&quot;, as in 探す .) <em>Miss World</em> climbs a <em>tree</em> in order to avoid getting<strong> grope</strong>d by the pervert&#039;s <em>fingers</em>. He doesn&#039;t know she can climb and is still <strong>looking for</strong> her...

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 15-1-2008(9): (This kanji&#039;s meaning is &quot;to seek&quot; or &quot;to probe&quot;, so it&#039;s more &quot;grope&quot; in the sense of &quot;groping for answers&quot;. ) The <em>fingers</em> of the <em>brat prince</em> [323] are <strong>groping</strong> for his <em>wooden</em> scepter to whack his advisor with.
