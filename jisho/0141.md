heisig: "Before we get to explaining this character, take a look at it and see if you can figure out the primitive elements on your own.... On the left is the <i>water</i>&nbsp;- that much is easy. On the right we have only one primitive, the kanji for <i>morning</i> learned back in Frame 53. See how an apparently complex kanji falls apart neatly into manageable pieces? To get the meaning of the key word <b>tide</b>, just think of it in connection with the character for <i>eventide</i> that we learned back in Frame 115. Here we have the <i>morning</i>-<b>tide</b>, its complement. By the way, if you missed the question about the number of primitives, it is probably because you forgot what we said earlier about kanji becoming primitives, independently of the pieces that make them up. As a rule, look for the largest kanji you can write and proceed from there to primitives stranded on their own."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 27-7-2007(205): The morning<strong> tide</strong> is basically, well, WATER in the MORNING.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mesqueeb">Mesqueeb</a>] 19-4-2009(46): If it&#039;s not Eventide ( 汐 ) it must be <em>morning</em><strong> tide</strong>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shimouma">shimouma</a>] 12-6-2008(46): This is not the eventide, but the water of the morning<strong> tide</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dogen2">dogen2</a>] 17-3-2007(20): The water rises with the morning<strong> tide</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kyotokanji">kyotokanji</a>] 28-3-2007(13): Imagine falling asleep drunk on the beach, you wake up quickly in the morning as the water from the<strong> tide</strong> hits you and makes you wet.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 15-3-2007(9): I guess I find it more effective to think of this in terms of (water)-(mist)-&amp;-(moon) instead of water and morning. I picture a scene from space where we see the earth on the left and the moon to the right between them lies the mist of space dust. The water is the waters of the earth played upon through the mists of space by the gravity of the moon. It&#039;s the gravity of the moon that causes the<strong> TIDE</strong> to rise and fall, no?

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Teango">Teango</a>] 8-4-2010(6): <em>Water</em> goes out with the <em>morning</em><strong> tide</strong>, the mist and moon are by its side.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/keiners">keiners</a>] 7-10-2009(5): <strong>TIDE</strong> is WATER(氵) being pulled in a CART ( 車 ) by the MOON ( 月 ).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/undomiel">undomiel</a>] 6-4-2011(4): The<strong> tide</strong> water rolls in on a misty morning.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 3-5-2007(4): Surfers race against the<strong> tide</strong> to have as much fun in the water in the early morning.
