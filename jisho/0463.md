4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 29-2-2008(23): The beggar is licking the ten sunflowers to get some moisture from the mist. Why? It has been a<strong> drought</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 26-5-2010(6): In times of<strong> drought</strong>, the <em>mist</em> they had <em>begged</em> so desperately for finally came, a sign that moisture was in the air...

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kakashi">kakashi</a>] 31-1-2011(5): When there&#039;s a<strong> drought</strong>, one doesn&#039;t care about his/her pride -- he/she will <em>beg</em> just for a light <em>mist</em> to water the crops.
