## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 28-9-2006(302): <strong>Beforehand</strong>, this was a <em>halberd</em> but I cut it short so it could <strong>be for hand</strong> to hand combat.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 12-9-2006(126): Your <em>halberd</em> doesn&#039;t have a handguard? You should have thought of that<strong> beforehand</strong> (i.e., before you were missing your hand).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zwarte_kat">zwarte_kat</a>] 15-2-2009(25): This is the halberd<strong> beforehand</strong>, i mean: before you draw the hand (the last stroke of halberd).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 3-7-2010(9): Be sure to check your <em>halberd</em><strong> beforehand</strong> to make sure it&#039;s not missing its final stroke.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 10-12-2007(6): As others see it, think of<strong> BEFOREHAND</strong> with Forehand, which easily reminds you of a tennis racket for use as a primitive in later kanji. It even looks like a tennis racket, so all the better.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 29-1-2008(5): <strong>Before your hand</strong> can touch the <em>halberd</em>, you must be wearing gloves <strong>beforehand</strong>. Therefore this kanji is a <em>halberd</em> but <em>missing the last essential stroke (the last essential step)</em>. Primitive meaning: <strong>glove</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/manubear">manubear</a>] 5-5-2012(4): The handle of my <em>halberd</em> is broken. Oops, should have checked that <strong>beforehand</strong> ( 予想 , 予選 , 予約 , 予告編 , 予定 , 天気予報 ) [As a primitive = <em>Genghis Khan</em> - they used to say he was one handle short of a halberd!].

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SuzuBell">SuzuBell</a>] 24-2-2011(4): This 35-year-old mama&#039;s boy always asks his mother マ+ア (&quot;Ma&quot;) for permission<strong> beforehand</strong> - Even before asking a woman on a date!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/melchan">melchan</a>] 16-7-2009(4): The Japanese teacher says: &quot;I have<strong> beforehand</strong> written down the kanji for <a href="../1225">halberd</a> (#1225 矛). All you need to do now is add the last stroke&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 10-6-2008(4): Make a reservation （ 予約 ）<strong> beforehand</strong>.
