## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 17-12-2007(148): <strong>Warning:</strong> The left part is NOT the primitive <em>turtle</em>! The stroke order is different. Sometimes it will look exactly the same but not always depending on the font / style used to draw this character. Be sure to study the difference!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shadolite">shadolite</a>] 20-3-2008(122): In the<strong> north</strong>, the weather is so cold that people are often seen sitting back to back to preserve warmth.

The stroke order is different. Sometimes it will look exactly the same but not always depending on the font / style used to draw this character. Be sure to study the difference! My &#039;story&#039;: There are NO <em>turtles</em> at the <strong>North</strong> Pole. What looks like turtle-backs are actually Igloos, so small you can barely <em>sit</em> inside them.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alatown">alatown</a>] 5-8-2009(17): The<strong> north</strong> is cold, so why doesn&#039;t this couple spoon to keep warm?

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63">ashman63</a>] 9-4-2008(11): People! this has nothing to do with turtles. The strokes are different. Don&#039;t use turtle in this story. Just stick to the people sitting back to back in the cold<strong> north</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 11-3-2011(10): 北海道 , 北極 , 北極点 , 北朝鮮 , 北半球 , 北側 , 北口 , 北緯 <a href="../v4/445">north</a> (#445 北) ホク, きた ... Parts: 扌＊, 匕 (cf: 比べる <a href="../v4/447">compare</a> (#447 比), 進化 <a href="../v4/1008">change</a> (#1008 化), 桃子 <a href="../v4/236">peach tree</a> (#236 桃), 背中 <a href="../v4/446">stature</a> (#446 背)) ... I never got the stroke order, or the shape, or the stroke count of the left side correct until I realized that it is the <em>Fingers primitive with the tips broken off</em>. , so Beware <em>sitting on the ground</em> at the <strong>North</strong> Pole ( 北極点 ): you&#039;ll get frostbite, and the <em>Tips of your Fingers will fall off</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elanlan">elanlan</a>] 26-8-2009(5): When <em>sitting on the ground</em> amidst the great Peter<strong> North</strong>, one better face the opposite direction.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/effer">effer</a>] 11-2-2012(3): Two guys ice fishing up<strong> north</strong>, sitting back to back, but one of them is taking a shit thru his ice hole. The other guy might be catching a brown fish...

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 20-1-2010(3): Joe(left) and Fred(right) sit back to back in the Frozen<strong> North</strong>, trying to save heat as they wait for someone to find and rescue them. &quot;I&#039;m starting to think they&#039;ll never find us, &quot; says Fred. No response. &quot;Joe? Joe?! ... Are you ok?&quot; To Fred&#039;s horror, he finds that Joe is frozen solid, his arms and legs out straight. Fred is at first devastated, but when help still fails to arrive, he is forced to grab a <em>spoon</em> and enjoy Joe &quot;Alive&quot; style.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gopineapples">gopineapples</a>] 28-5-2009(3): The<strong> north</strong> is so cold that people sit back to back.
