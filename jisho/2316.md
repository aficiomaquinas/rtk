heisig: "This character can mean both to <b>cleanse</b> and to make dirty. We will choose the latter and imagine someone who is displeasingly <i>plump</i> going to a skinny spa whose medicinal <i>waters</i> promise to <b>cleanse</b> him of his unwanted corpulence. Picture him sitting in the spa as the pounds melt away, leaving a greasy scum on top of the <i>water</i>."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 28-11-2008(71): I couldn&#039;t find any reference to this kanji as meaning<strong> cleanse</strong>. It seems to be most often used in the following compound   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/沙汰">沙汰</a>  （さた）to mean affair. The other meanings seem to be closer to &#039;select&#039; so maybe Heisig meant<strong> cleanse</strong> in the ethnic sense here.. I&#039;m going to use the keyword &quot;selection&quot;, as in natural selection. Story: natural selection first began in the water, and those that were too plump were selected out. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 24-7-2009(27): <em>Water</em> is used to<strong> cleanse</strong> a <em>plump</em> man&#039;s colon.

Each day he drinks his 3l of <em>water</em>, swim half a hour in <em>water</em>... 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 5-8-2009(4): The very plump man selected the Japanese toilet seat which will<strong> cleanse</strong> him with water automatically since he&#039;s too fat to reach back and wipe... (consider herman&#039;s explanation and think of &quot;selection&quot;).

Story: The Pacific Ocean (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/太平洋">太平洋</a>  ) routinely sweeps <em>Water</em> over low lying islands <strong>Cleansing</strong> them of human traces.
