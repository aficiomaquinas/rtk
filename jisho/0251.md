heisig: "As the <b>world</b> gets <i>jammed</i> with more and more people, there is less and less space. Imagine yourself taking an air flight over a <b>world</b> so densely populated that every bit of it is sectioned off like a gigantic checkerboard (the <i>rice fields</i>). If you look closely at the character, you should be able to see a kind of movement taking place as still more is being <b>jammed into</b> that already narrow space."
