For some reason he insisted on working at the top of a <em>pinnacle</em>, away from the distractions of the world.

However, the poor old man (who is not aware his stuff is so expensive - he&#039;s currently being given $2 for stuff that sells for $2M) isn&#039;t allowed to live in the <em>Pinnacle</em>. So in order to transfer his stuff, he puts his<strong> pottery</strong> in a small <em>tin can</em>, <em>bounds it up</em> tightly with rope, and sends it up on a line to the <em>Pinnacle</em>, where the greedy men take it and sell it.
