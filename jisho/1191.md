## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 31-1-2010(209): <strong>Commoner</strong>s have to huddle in <em>caverns around a campfire</em>, while higher class people get heating and central air conditioning in a hotel. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fagie37">fagie37</a>] 28-5-2008(71): If you are so poor that you are a<strong> commoner</strong>, you will have to live twenty<strong> commoner</strong>s to a cavern, with only one fire for everyone to share. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epsilondelta">epsilondelta</a>] 14-12-2009(58): PRIMITIVE: <em>Cave</em> + <em>twenty</em> = <strong>Finnish sauna</strong> (instead of Heisig&#039;s &quot;caverns&quot;, which I&#039;d confuse with &quot;cave&quot;). This primitive meaning works well for all kanji it occurs in; I&#039;ve posted stories for all of them. STORY: Wealthy people have a <em>sauna</em> in their house, but<strong> commoner</strong>s have to use their <em>oven fire</em> to warm themselves. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 7-2-2006(25): I draw upon The Two Towers again. Imagine the scene where the people of rohan seeks refuge in the cavernous fortress of Helms Cleft. The nobility and warriors stand ground at the bulwark, where as the<strong> commoner</strong> stay behind in the huge caverns of 20 little fireplaces. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 18-11-2007(12): Tamaki is fantasizing about Haruhi again (Ouran Host Club), thinking of her<strong> commoner</strong> lifestyle, eating<strong> commoner</strong> food--in this particular fantasy, she&#039;s in a <em>cave</em> with <em>twenty</em> raggedy<strong> commoner</strong> family members (must have borrowed some siblings from Yamada Taro Monogatari) trying to huddle around a <em>fire</em>, cooking some sort of<strong> commoner</strong> food. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RobMow">RobMow</a>] 15-9-2008(10): A<strong> commoner</strong> is forced to huddle around a fire in a cavern for warmth. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 4-1-2010(7): Caverns suggest the labyrinth of Crete and the myth of the <em>Minotaur</em>. Each year, the villagers have to sacrifice a virgin<strong> commoner</strong> to the minotaur. He then roasts the young woman on his <em>cooking fire</em>. This year the<strong> commoner</strong> is Barbara Walters. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 17-8-2006(7): <strong>Commoner</strong>s had to huddle in caves in groups of 20 around a campfire, while their lords lived in luxury. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjiknight">kanjiknight</a>] 9-1-2009(6): It&#039;s a cheap accommodation for<strong> commoner</strong>s. Basically, it&#039;s a <em>cavern</em> with <em>20</em> available <em>caves</em> for rent where you can prepare your meals on a shared <em>cooking fire</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dusmar84">dusmar84</a>] 20-1-2010(5): I was having trouble remembering cavern so I think of them being TWENTY times the size of a CAVE. A Cavern is just a large cave.|<strong> commoner</strong>s have to huddle in caverns around a campfire, while higher class people get heating and central air conditioning in a hotel (thx cham cham).
