## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 1-6-2008(54): Skunk, white, human legs: You should have seen the shocked<strong> countenance</strong> on the girls&#039; face when she saw the <em>skunk</em> nibbling away at the <em>white human legs</em> of the corpse she found in the woods. (Because of that, and the smell of course).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 16-7-2007(21): He counters, &quot;Your <em>legs</em> are so <em>white</em>, all I would have to do is apply some black and they would be the perfect<strong> countenance</strong> of a <em>skunk</em>!&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 17-10-2008(13): The shocked<strong> countenance</strong> on girl&#039;s face when Pepe started to hump her white legs.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ghinzdra">ghinzdra</a>] 14-9-2009(9): Anyone who watched a looney tunes cartoon know those kind of scene : pepe embraces a poor kitty mistaken for a SKUNK and the smell of pepe make the unfortunate girl loose all<strong> countenance</strong> : she turns WHITE then runs as fast as her LEGS can carry her . So much for cat s dignity and<strong> countenance</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 10-11-2010(3): <em>Pepe LePew&#039;s</em><strong> countenance</strong> isn&#039;t so bad; it&#039;s the smell that makes everyone turn <em>white</em> and dash off on their <em>human legs</em>!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 25-2-2010(3): <em>White + human legs</em> also appears in <a href="../2854">helmet</a> (#2854 兜). I think of it as <em>fancy dress costume</em>. The baby&#039;s <em>skunk</em> costume exposes only its <em>white</em><strong> countenance</strong>, while its <em>human legs</em> are covered by the paws: <a href="http://images.buycostumes.com/mgen/merchandiser/32492.jpg">http://images.buycostumes.com/mgen/merchandiser/32492.jpg</a>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 26-7-2007(2): That <strong>count</strong> is <strong>a nancy</strong> boy! Dressed up in his count&#039;s cape, he looks like a <em>skunk</em>, and with his naked <em>white legs</em> sticking out, he is nothing if not silly.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alucardchuu">alucardchuu</a>] 19-7-2010(1): Look at pepe the skunk, walking like a human with his white furry stripe, he has some<strong> countenance</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Panta">Panta</a>] 26-3-2013(): She takes off her <a href="../2854">helmet</a> (#2854 兜), and out comes the <strong>countenance</strong> of a <em>skunk</em>!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ktcgx">ktcgx</a>] 17-3-2013(): You should have seen the shocked<strong> countenance</strong> on the girls&#039; face when she saw <em>Pepe Le Pew</em> nibbling away at the <em>white</em> <em>human legs</em> in the forest. I thought he only went for cats?!
