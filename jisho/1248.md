heisig: "The key word <b>somebody</b> was chosen to convey the double meaning of this kanji: body and person. Its composition is based on the <i>nose</i> (which, you will recall, is also the kanji for <i>oneself</i>). The extension of the bottom and far right strokes of that element, together with the unusual diagonal stroke, forms the pictograph of <b>somebody</b> with a prominent paunch."
