6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lee101">lee101</a>] 28-7-2011(13): (part 2) Heisig clearly states that it&#039;s fine to do this and it may even enhance the story so that it stays in the memory for longer, yet the people who post these stories, God bless them, are receiving an onslaught of reports, where are these reports coming from!? I think that 98% of people doing RTK have a sense of humour right? Political Correctness gone mad is what I say.
