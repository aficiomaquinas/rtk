## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 14-4-2007(206): The <em>shape</em> of a sheriff&#039;s <em>badge</em> makes it<strong> patent</strong> who he is. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 18-12-2006(36): <em>Mystique</em> the shape-shifter sneaks into the<strong> patent</strong> office easily after she steals an identity <em>badge</em> from a security guard. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 4-8-2007(31): Note: the keyword has nothing to do with trademarks and is to be understood in the sense of a &quot;public recognition&quot;. However the kanji is not common, so getting the exact meaning is not a big deal. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 11-9-2007(30): YOU have the <strong>patent</strong> for <em>Playdoh</em>? That&#039;s <strong>patent</strong>ly false. See here, I have the <em>badge</em> of proof issued from the <strong>patent</strong> office. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 31-3-2008(24): It was<strong> patent</strong>ly absurd when the fellow tried to arrest me--his <em>badge</em> was the wrong <em>shape</em>: a <em>vase</em> and a <em>sunflower</em>? Come now. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 23-11-2008(17): This is<strong> patent</strong> in the sense of being clear, not a<strong> patent</strong> for an invention. Mystique is wearing a badge to make it clear who she is no matter what she morphs into. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 10-4-2009(10): You badge is made out of play-doh. It&#039;s also the wrong shape. It&#039;s pretty<strong> patent</strong>/manifest (I personally prefer manifest as a keyword) that it&#039;s fake... 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/b0ng0">b0ng0</a>] 13-2-2009(7): The <em>shape</em> of a sheriff&#039;s <em>badge</em> is <strong>patented</strong> so no one else can copy him. (Modified from Raichu). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 15-12-2012(6): From the <em>badge</em>&#039;s <em>shape</em>, it is<strong> patent</strong>ly obvious where the official worked: in the U.S.<strong> patent</strong> office. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 5-2-2008(4): <em>Bruce Lee</em> once was denied entry to his own movie set by stagehands with <em>badge</em>s. The minimum-wage <em>badge</em>d workers blocked <em>Bruce Lee&#039;s</em> entry to his own set because he didn&#039;t have a <em>badge</em> - the workers said, &quot;sorry, buddy - no <em>badge</em>, no access.&quot; <em>Bruce Lee</em> screamed, &quot;I&#039;m <em>Bruce Lee</em>! This is my movie! Isn&#039;t that<strong> patent</strong>ly obvious?&quot;.
