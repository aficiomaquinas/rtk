heisig: A <i>meadow</i> and a <i>head</i> are all we are given to work with in the kanji for <b>petition</b>. Since the key word already suggests something like a formal request made of some higher power, let us imagine a gigantic Wizard-of-Oz <i>head</i> located in the middle of the flowery <i>meadow</i> we used in the last frame. Then just picture people kneeling hopefully before it, <b>petitioning</b> for whatever it is they want. (The scarecrow wanted brains, the lion, courage, and the tin man a heart. What about you?)
