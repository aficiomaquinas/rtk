heisig: "The <i>part of the body</i> first affected by a stroll through a haunted <i>graveyard</i> is the skin, which gets goose bumps. But we save the word &quot;skin&quot; for another kanji, and use the odd word &quot;<b>membrane</b>&quot; here. Think of being so scared through and through that the goose flesh moves from the outside in, giving you goose <b>membranes</b>."
