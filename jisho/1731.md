2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 6-6-2007(98): <strong>Finish</strong> him! Subzero <em>adjusts</em> the <em>water</em> in your body and crushes you into a few million pieces. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aniseed">aniseed</a>] 6-2-2009(37): After i&#039;ve<strong> finish</strong>ed having a pee i adjust my trousers. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 5-4-2009(26): After you<strong> finish</strong> exercising, be sure to drink some water and adjust your pace (cool down and stretch). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 19-12-2007(19): After the <em>Scotsman goalkeeper</em> gave someone a dose of poison [1730], someone from the opposing team engaged him in a match of Mortal Kombat. Uh oh, looks like the <em>Scotsman</em> lost - &quot;Finish Him!!!&quot; and as the <strong>finish</strong>ing punch is delivered, drops of <em>water</em> (ala SNES) come out, not blood...pretty disappointing. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ampharos64">Ampharos64</a>] 11-7-2009(18): (for Zelda players) After spending a lot of time in the <em>Water</em> Temple, you get fed up of <em>adjust</em>ing the <em>water</em> level.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 24-2-2008(9): This kanji is also used for すみません (I&#039;m sorry). Literally, your saying &quot;it does not end (my debt to you, the fact that I harmed you, etc.)&quot; when you say すみません. STORY: (see my story for 1729) Your science teacher tells you &quot;...now, to<strong> FINISH</strong> this experiment take two SYMMETRICAL beakers and put in an even amount of LIQUID (some sort of chemical).&quot; But you screw up, it blows up, and all you can say is &quot;sumimasen...&quot;.

This time he waits until the game is<strong> finish</strong>ed. While his teammates cheers, he says:   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/済みません">済みません</a>   （すみません）, I have to go and drink some <em>water</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/WithLoveFromExIA">WithLoveFromExIA</a>] 21-6-2010(6): A few <em>drops of water adjusted</em> the athlete&#039;s performance, getting him/her/it all the way to the<strong> finish</strong>. I picure Popeye with a few drops of spinich juice.
