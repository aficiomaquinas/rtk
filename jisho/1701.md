## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 21-11-2006(200): In the <em>water</em> between Japan and China, the<strong> Sino-</strong> side has put <em>scarecrows</em> in the water to try and keep the Japanese away.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 19-4-2008(107): Take the left to be &quot;kanji&quot; not scarecrow.<strong> Sino-</strong> (Chinese) people had to put a lot of sweat into learning the kanji. See the drops of sweat coming off.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 13-8-2009(54): <em>Kanji</em> came from across the <em>water</em>, on the<strong> Sino-</strong> side of things.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DeadLugosi">DeadLugosi</a>] 28-9-2008(40): This is the character you have on the left top of this website ;-).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aphasiac">aphasiac</a>] 9-9-2010(31): <strong>Sino-</strong> (Chinese) people had to put a lot of <em>sweat/water</em> into learning the <em>kanji</em>. For right-hand <em>kanji</em> primitive - The dumb Western <em>husband</em> of a Japanese woman buys her <em>flowers</em> to apologise, after he opened his big <em>mouth</em> and said &quot;<strong>kanji</strong> are a stupid writing system&quot;..

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 27-1-2008(18): Chinese (Sino-) <em>water</em> torture was perfected by practicing on <em>scarecrows</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 25-10-2005(14): In China (Sino-) they have &quot;<em>water scarecrows</em>&quot;. That is, the scarecrows that stand in rice fields, have their feet wet all the time.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hinode">Hinode</a>] 22-3-2009(12): Note: The primitive &quot;scarecrow&quot; written as a kanji of its own means &quot;must not&quot;. It fits well with the image of a scarecrow. &quot;You birds <em>must not</em> eat the crop!&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 16-9-2009(11): Changing the primitive on the right to &quot;kanji&quot;: Originally called &quot;Sino-characters,&quot; once they crossed the water from China to Japan, they became known as kanji.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thora">Thora</a>] 19-3-2008(9): Hint: Scarecrow for the right primitive may get confused with strawman, Wizard of Oz and vulture/broom stories. Consider using cabbage patch doll (or something else) to avoid such similarities.
