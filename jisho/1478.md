### On-Yomi: ヨウ &mdash; Kun-Yomi: おさな.い

## Heisig story:

Cocoon . . . muscle.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 5-9-2006(287): In its<strong> infancy</strong>, a butterfly is protected by a <em>cocoon</em>, as it doesn&#039;t yet have any <em>power</em> of its own.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet">sweetneet</a>] 26-10-2006(52): During their<strong> infancy</strong>, children are often wrapped up tight like a <em>cocoon</em> (i.e. in those Snugli carriers) and supported by the <em>muscle</em> of their parents.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 13-6-2006(38): During<strong> INFANCY</strong> the moth in its COCOON gains its POWER.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 31-5-2007(21): In<strong> infancy</strong> it is the struggle to break out of the <em>cocoon</em> that develops a butterfly&#039;s <em>muscles</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 30-9-2009(15): Your<strong> infancy</strong> starts when you have enough <em>power</em> to break your <em>cocoon</em> (amniotic sac).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crayonmaster">crayonmaster</a>] 4-4-2009(13): I don&#039;t really like the primitive cocoon much, so I changed it to Metapod, the pokemon. It fits in quite nicely with the next couple of stories.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kamikettu">Kamikettu</a>] 24-7-2011(11): [+crayonmaster] In their<strong> infancy</strong> <em>Metapods</em> are very powerful... At making you bored, that is. The <em>cocoon with eyes</em> only has one <em>power</em>: Harden. What does it do? Practically it makes the fights just last longer. Sure, the opposing Pokémon&#039;s <em>power</em> does not feel that effective, but does <em>Metapod</em> have any <em>powers</em> to actually beat them? How about having your Pokémon &quot;fight&quot; another one of the same species? Now that&#039;s a blast to watch. <em>Metapods</em> in their <em>kiddie state</em> are just useless.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 24-3-2008(5): In<strong> infancy</strong>, Conan spun a cocoon and burst forth some years later fully muscled.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/coinbaahd">coinbaahd</a>] 22-10-2012(4): <strong>Infancy</strong> is the time when you are most vulnerable. So you have to be put in a protective <em>cocoon</em> until you have the <em>strength</em> to break yourself out. Imagine the baby raptor in Jurassic park.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aab47">aab47</a>] 28-8-2010(4): Cocoon Primitive Hint: I use &#039;Peter Parker&#039; because it is identical to &#039;Spiderman&#039; except there&#039;s no &#039;web&#039;. I just imagine Peter Parker living in a cocoon in his pre-spiderman days so I can use cocoon/PeterParker interchangeably.
