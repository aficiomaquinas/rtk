## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 25-5-2006(117): Pictograph of a stanchion, which includes two vertical posts to restrain cows so they can be milked, with a horizontal stroke showing the number of cows per stanchion: one. A stanchion is a great symbol for the<strong> SIGN OF THE COW</strong>, since modern, domesticated cows are often stanchioned in barns.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 11-3-2008(106): 77 cows behind a fence.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 15-4-2007(68): There&#039;s no<strong> sign of the cow</strong>. She saw those <em>daggers</em> – <em>two</em> of them – and ran off.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/furrykef">furrykef</a>] 9-7-2008(48): (Slight adjustment of raseru&#039;s story.) You pull out two 二 daggers 刀 and carve this<strong> sign of the cow</strong> into the poor cow. Hint: imagine using the two daggers in place of a branding iron to brand the cow. The stroke order is the same as &quot;dagger, two&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 21-7-2009(21): No<strong> sign of the cow</strong>, because the <em>7 Samurai</em> ate her.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 12-10-2010(8): <em>Ball</em>ed up <em>dirt</em>? I don&#039;t think so. You just stepped in the<strong> sign of the cow</strong>!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alunalun">Alunalun</a>] 14-8-2009(8): Hint: Written the same as <a href="../255">king</a> (#255 王), but with first stroke changed from a horizontal line to a double-stroke, left-to-right-to-down. Story: Let this be <em>cow</em> from &#039;Cow and Chicken&#039;. Cow is dressed as a <em>king</em> but its incongruous udders, which ruin every costume it wears, remind you of the changed first stroke.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 23-5-2011(6): For India, the<strong> sign of the cow</strong>, the sacred cow, is <em>one</em> big fat <em>stylized number one</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Renaissance">Renaissance</a>] 18-11-2009(5): There&#039;s no sign of any cow here... What? Are you blind? There are 77 cows behind that fence. (thanks Filip).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru">raseru</a>] 17-6-2008(5): You pull out two 二 daggers 刀 and carve this<strong> sign of the cow</strong> into the poor cow.
