## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/revenantkioku">revenantkioku</a>] 10-12-2007(321): Drag + rag gave me trouble until I came up with zombie for it. The zombie population became more diverse, separating into different<strong> faction</strong>s. One of them being the water Zombies. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 13-3-2007(48): The radical <strong>faction</strong> is almost eliminated, sir. They&#039;re living in the <em>sewers</em> dressed in <em>rags</em> and <em>dragging</em> their supplies. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 16-4-2008(16): The right hand side means <em>tributary</em>, and the <em>rag</em> part of it doesn&#039;t have the usual overlap with the first stroke. <strong>Factions</strong> split off from the main group like <em>tributaries</em> do from the main <em>water</em> course. <strong>Veins</strong> are the <em>tributaries</em> of your <em>body</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 8-5-2006(10): WAter drag rag. The red<strong> faction</strong> must live underground in the watery sewers to avoid persecuption. They drag their supplies with them through the tunnels, each and every one clad in dirty rags. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSleeve">TheSleeve</a>] 7-1-2009(8): DRAG + RAG = ZOMBIE (walking around slowly, dragging feet, tattered rages...) In &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot; there are &quot;normal&quot; zombies and also some<strong> FACTION</strong>S of specialized zombies: Smoker, Hunter, Boomer, oh, and the WATER-spraying &quot;Soaker&quot; ZOMBIES. Thanks to revenantkioku for the zombie idea. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 9-12-2008(6): The vegan <em>zombie</em><strong> faction</strong> does not eat brains, but only drinks <em>water</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RedKing">RedKing</a>] 7-3-2010(5): These two<strong> faction</strong>s compete in drag boat racing. They hold these events in the water, and the woman standing at the start line drops the rag to indicate the race has begun. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 10-6-2010(4): The losing<strong> faction</strong> <em>drag</em>ged rags over their <em>water</em> drenched (from tears) faces. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 11-7-2009(4): A<strong> faction</strong> against pollution staged an <em>avalanche</em> of <em>watery handkerchiefs</em> to symbolize the cleanup of the environment they hoped to see in the future. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stazor">stazor</a>] 29-4-2011(3): The radical<strong> faction</strong> ended terribly. All that is left from them is a rag dragging in the water.
