## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 19-3-2007(219): This kanji is<strong> NOT</strong> a piglett.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie">mhheie</a>] 14-2-2008(69): The butcher is standing over the piglet. &quot;This is a piglet...(cuts of head)...<strong>NOT</strong>!&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samesong">samesong</a>] 28-9-2008(25): Three strings walk into a bar. The bartender throws them out, yelling &quot;Can&#039;t you read the sign?! I don&#039;t serve strings.&quot; The strings try again, and again the bartender kicks them out. Finally, one of the strings gets the idea to mess himself up a little. He walks into the bar. The bartender scowls, &quot;What&#039;s wrong with you? Can&#039;t you read? I don&#039;t serve strings!&quot; The string replies, &quot;I&#039;m a frayed knot!&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 8-10-2007(25): Ceci<strong> NOT</strong> pas une piglette.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penot">penot</a>] 29-9-2008(13): <a href="../v4/1820">argument</a> (#1820 論)=( 論 )=RON argued, &quot;(<strong>勿</strong>論) &#039;<strong>MOCHI</strong>&#039;RON, this kanji is<strong> NOT</strong> a piglett.... &quot;.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brose">brose</a>] 22-11-2006(13): 匁 <a href="../v4/1027">monme</a> (#1027 匁) with the knot untied so it looks like 勿 .

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stryder">Stryder</a>] 5-12-2007(8): Borat says, &quot;This little piggy went to the market...<strong> NOT</strong>!&quot; Then he rips its tail off.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asriel">Asriel</a>] 30-3-2009(7): I think of this as a ≠ sign. I find it&#039;s helpful to know the difference between just using &#039;not&#039; as a word in my stories, and when &#039;≠&#039; is being used as a primitive.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/partyrash">partyrash</a>] 22-1-2008(5): Mochi, from mochiron, of course.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Puchatek">Puchatek</a>] 30-11-2010(4): Here is a piglet // whose body is<strong> not</strong>. // All that remains // is a tail like a knot.
