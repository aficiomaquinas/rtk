## Koohii stories:

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 25-8-2007(145): Remember the scene in <strong>A Christmas Story</strong> where the <em>big dogs</em> <strong>robbed</strong> the family of their Christmas <em>turkey</em>? Well, the following year Ralphie&#039;s mom glued the holiday bird to the kitchen table, just as a precaution. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/phate1313">phate1313</a>] 5-3-2008(52): The turkey and a St.Bernard dog are going to<strong> rob</strong> a bank. The turkey first, the dog behind him. When they approach the bank the turkey pulls out a tube of glue and says, &quot;Remember Dawg, it&#039;s a<strong> rob</strong>bery, whatever happens we gotta stick together.

Disgusting? Yes... easy to forget the story and its primitive order? You decide. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 15-9-2009(30): A giant turkey just<strong> rob</strong>bed me- with a glue gun! 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lizzie">Lizzie</a>] 5-8-2008(14): Somebody tried to<strong> rob</strong> us of our large turkey so we simply glued it to the ground.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/findus">findus</a>] 8-6-2009(8): To avoid the confusion with <a href="../1451">steal</a> <span class="index">(#1451 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/盗">盗</a>)</span>, remember &quot;Rob by a dog&quot;. Story by pupul07: Don&#039;t let the neighbor&#039;s <em>St.Bernard</em> <strong>rob</strong> tonight&#039;s <em>turkey</em>....<em>glue</em> it to the table if you must. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 7-1-2008(7): <strong>Rob</strong> means to take by force, and a<strong> rob</strong>ber has no noble intentions (distinguish from burglar and steal). Imagine a convenience store <strong>rob</strong>bery. The perpetrators are the tag team of a <em>St. Bernard Dog</em>, to launch a ground attack, and a <em>turkey</em> to launch an air attack (albeit a poor one). Why are they<strong> rob</strong>bing the convenience store? Because they&#039;re drug addicts - they need some super <em>glue</em> for sniffing so that they can get high on the fumes. Low-life<strong> rob</strong>bers have such low goals.

The little nerd chicken has <em>glued</em> Foghorn&#039;s feet to, I dunno, a freight train or something. As he disappears over the horizon, Foghorn&#039;s voice calls back, &quot;Why, this is...I say, this is HIGH-way<strong> rob</strong>bery, son!&quot;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/略奪">略奪</a>   (りゃくだつ) : pillage, plunder, looting,<strong> rob</strong>bery;   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/奪う">奪う</a>   (うばう) : snatch away.
