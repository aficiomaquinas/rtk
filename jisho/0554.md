## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 3-6-2007(224): This New-Zealand pro-gamer has won many <strong>distinctions</strong> playing <em>WoolCraft</em> (a massively multi-user game in which the goal is to shear sheep).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dicedice">dicedice</a>] 5-8-2007(141): Noob players make no<strong> distinction</strong> between what games they play, whether it&#039;s the geniune thing or a bootleg fake copy. The biggest example of course, would be the legit World of Warcraft and the biggest ripoff there is: World of <em>Wool</em>-<em>craft</em>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tuuli">tuuli</a>] 11-12-2007(40): Since all sheep look alike, it is hard to make a<strong> distinction</strong> between them. You have to learn the <em>craft</em> of telling them apart by their <em>wool</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saxman_52">saxman_52</a>] 12-6-2009(18): A<strong> distinction</strong> must be made between &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; and &quot;<em>Wool</em> over <em>Craft</em>.&quot;.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fionnula123">fionnula123</a>] 31-1-2009(13): There is a huge<strong> distinction</strong> between <em>wool</em> which has been hand<em>craft</em>ed and those made by a machine.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru">raseru</a>] 8-3-2008(9): Don&#039;t make the same mistake as me. There is a huge<strong> distinction</strong> between WoolCraft and WarCraft.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Axlen">Axlen</a>] 7-3-2010(8): A person of<strong> Distinction</strong> wears &#039;<em>wool</em>&#039; &#039;<em>crafted</em>&#039; suits.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kakashi">kakashi</a>] 31-5-2010(7): (Don&#039;t confuse with <a href="../482">discriminating</a> (#482 識).) It&#039;s a <em>craft</em> of expert <em>sheep</em> shavers to make a<strong> distinction</strong> between good wool and bad, by moving the tail to the side and examining the quality of the sheep. You can picture the expert, moving from sheep to sheep, giving a &quot;YES&quot; or &quot;NO&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 2-2-2013(5): The<strong> distinction</strong> between World of Warcraft and World of <em>WoolCraft</em> couldn&#039;t be clearer could it? What on earth made you think your 15 year-old son wanted a book of knitting patterns for his birthday? I was a bit surprised, he said <em>sheep</em>ishly. (thanks astgtciv).
