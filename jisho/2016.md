## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 16-3-2007(188): After worshipping the <em>golden calf</em>, God sent the Jews on a long <em>road</em> through the wilderness. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 28-3-2008(92): The problem with the &quot;gold calf&quot; primitive is that the first vertical stroke of &quot;heavenly&quot; is shorter than the second stroke. But as we know, &quot;heavenly&quot; clearly has the FIRST stroke longer, not the second. The primitives we really have here are &quot;animal horns (first 3 strokes)&quot; and &quot;big/dog (last 3 strokes).&quot; What are the BIGGEST ANIMAL HORNS that you can think of? For me its a MASTODON. STORY: In caveman times, you SENT OFF packages with the MASTODON express. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-7-2009(28): I couldn&#039;t stand the <em>horny St. Bernard</em> any longer, so I <strong>escorted</strong> it to the <em>road</em> and gave it a<strong> send off</strong> to go get neutered. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 22-5-2008(14): (note: I changed golden calf to Satan: came from heaven and grew horns) Satan was escorted by Michael during his<strong> send off</strong> down the roads of heaven. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/slats70">slats70</a>] 10-4-2009(12): Primitive: Animal horns + big =<em> Wooly Mammoth</em>. Story:There was a big<strong> send off</strong> for <em>Wooly mammoth</em> and all his friends waved goodbye as he left down the <em>road</em>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 20-4-2008(11): When I hit the <em>road</em>, my friends gave me an amazing<strong> send off</strong> by presenting me with a <em>golden calf</em>. I think they thought I was Jewish or something. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Machine_Gun_Cat">Machine_Gun_Cat</a>] 21-5-2009(10): Moses returns to find the people have ditched his monotheistic preachings in favour of a more enlightened pagan ideology. He is promptly sent off. &quot;Hit the <em>road</em> moses we have a <em>golden calf</em> now!&quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akatsukigui">akatsukigui</a>] 8-12-2010(4): Primitive: Following Romanrozhok logic, i&#039;ll call this primitive a <em>hell hound</em>, the <em>st.bernard</em> with <em>horns</em>. Kanji: The <em>hell hound</em> is the dog that sends you off to a <em>road</em> straight to the hell if you provoke him.
