## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zwarte_kat">zwarte_kat</a>] 28-4-2007(262): A cow that is righteous<strong> sacrifice</strong>s her milk for the human race. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 2-9-2007(157): <em>Cows</em> are truly <em>righteous</em> animals. They<strong> SACRIFICE</strong> their milk so that we can have some. And if they don&#039;t have any left, they give a <em>sheep</em> a <em>hand fiesta</em> (good lord this is going too far) and give us that instead. What <em>righteous</em> <em>cows</em>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 26-5-2008(102): There are two kanji that need to be kept separate: this one and <a href="../1559">animal sacrifice</a> <span class="index">(#1559 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/牲">牲</a>)</span>. Think of it this way: here there is a <em>cow</em> and a <em>righteous</em> person (presumably a Hindu). One must be <strong>SACRIFICE</strong>d, so the righteous Hindu takes the place of the holy cow. But by the time frame 1559 rolls around, the Hindu is no longer alive to protect the cow, resulting in the <em>cow&#039;s life</em> ending in an <strong>animal<strong> sacrifice</strong></strong>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rivvie">Rivvie</a>] 18-2-2008(65): Vegetarians<strong> sacrifice</strong> eating steak (<em>cow</em>) because they believe it is a <em>righteous</em> thing to do. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MYRRIA">MYRRIA</a>] 28-9-2008(16): In the old testament times, <em>COWS</em> were<strong> SACRIFICE</strong> for <em>RIGHTEOUSNESS</em>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 28-6-2007(11): Cornered, by the bull and the sheep, I<strong> sacrifice</strong>d all sense of decency, gave the bull a hand fiesta, while the sheep watched from above me. This gave my friends time to flee. I hope they appreciated my<strong> sacrifice</strong>! 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 11-10-2005(10): A very <em>righteous cow</em> has<strong> sacrifice</strong>d her hay for the Christ Child&#039;s crib in your typical scene of the nativity. Picture the <em>righteous cow</em> with its inflated ego, condescending look, etc. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 10-4-2008(6): Hindus make the<strong> sacrifice</strong> of not eating beef because they believe that <strong>cows</strong> are <strong>righteous</strong> animals. (remember how <a href="../246">special</a> <span class="index">(#246 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/特">特</a>)</span> they are?). 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 16-5-2011(5): The ancient Israelites<strong> sacrifice</strong>d <a href="../245">cow</a> <span class="index">(#245 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/牛">牛</a>)</span>s. Think of Jesus as like the holy cow that spoke <a href="../247">revelation</a> <span class="index">(#247 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/告">告</a>)</span> and went on the road to <a href="../281">create</a> <span class="index">(#281 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/造">造</a>)</span> faith. This cow-like Jesus did a <a href="../641">righteousness</a> <span class="index">(#641 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/義">義</a>)</span> act -- by becoming humankind&#039;s<strong> sacrifice</strong>. And it was quite <a href="../641">righteousness</a> <span class="index">(#641 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/義">義</a>)</span> because his sheep-like docility dwarfed the human egos. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brainrobert1">brainrobert1</a>] 28-2-2011(5): Cow and righteousness =<strong> sacrifice</strong>. Hindus, in the name of the sacred COW and RIGHTEOUSNESS, make their<strong> sacrifice</strong> by NOT eating cow, instead of killing it. gisei 　  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/犠牲">犠牲</a>   (sacrifice)　giseisha　  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/犠牲者">犠牲者</a>   (sacrificial victim).
