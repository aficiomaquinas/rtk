## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod">PacifistGod</a>] 2-8-2007(155): After stopping a bank heist, Spiderman is seen<strong> winding</strong> his webbing around the stolen goods to trap them in a tree until the police arrive to take them back. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 28-2-2008(116): Tip: <em>goods</em> + <em>wood/tree</em> : This combination appears 4 times. I suggest calling it &quot;<em>furniture</em>&quot; (a common type of <em>wooden goods</em>). REF: <a href="../215">parch</a> <span class="index">(#215 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/燥">燥</a>)</span> , <a href="../671">maneuver</a> <span class="index">(#671 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/操">操</a>)</span>, <em>winding</em> (FRAME 1369), <a href="../2035">seaweed</a> <span class="index">(#2035 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/藻">藻</a>)</span>. Story: You are<strong> winding</strong> up your new <em>furniture</em> using a <em>thread</em> to get it through the window of your high-rise apartment. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shaydwyrm">shaydwyrm</a>] 13-5-2008(81): <em>Spiderman</em> often accidentally breaks his <em>furniture</em> (thanks Katsuo!) with his spider strength, so he is often seen <strong>winding</strong> his webbing around various pieces to repair them. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 28-11-2009(41): Primary meaning of this kanji has to do with turning pages/leafing through a book so I focus on that meaning. Also taking the furniture suggestion from Katsuo about the primitive on the right and making it even more concrete by having it refer to IKEA. Here I see Spiderman reading an IKEA catalogue, he&#039;s lost in thought leafing through the pages. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 14-7-2008(21): <strong>Winding</strong> <em>thread</em> around <em>wood</em>en <em>goods</em> to ready them for safe transport. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 11-4-2007(12): <strong>Winding</strong> a thread around a roll of parchment. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dat5h">dat5h</a>] 30-6-2009(10): Mouths in a tree are chirping birds (rare kanji 喿).<strong> Winding</strong> down after a long night of crimefighting, <em>spiderman</em> must <strong>wind</strong> up all of his loose webbing (picture him<strong> winding</strong> it up into a yarn ball). This time he got home so late that the he already hears the <em>birds chirping</em>. For a better idea, he decides to wind his webbing around the <em>mouths</em> of the <em>chirping birds</em> for a bit of extra quiet time. Imagine a clump of <em>spiderman&#039;s threads</em> <strong>wound</strong> around the <em>mouths</em> of a bunch of birds in a <em>tree</em>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster">snallygaster</a>] 5-3-2008(8): On a camping trip, I&#039;m using <strong>thread</strong> to hang my <strong>goods</strong> from a <strong>tree</strong>&#039;s branches (to keep them safe from bears), but the wind keeps<strong> winding</strong> them around the trunk! 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 22-11-2007(8): A twist on PacifistGod&#039;s story. <em>Spiderman</em> likes<strong> winding</strong>-up the robbers by maneuvering the stolen <em>goods</em> up into a <em>tree</em>, just out of their reach. (Also see <em>maneuver</em>). 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 31-1-2008(6): The Beatles: &quot;The long and<strong> winding</strong> <em>thread</em> (BAH BAH) tha-at leads (doo doo) to your <em>goods</em> (DAH DAH) on top of your tree...
