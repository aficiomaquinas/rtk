heisig: "A <b>tribute</b> has a kind of double-meaning in English: honor paid freely and <i>money</i> collected by coercion. Simply because a ruler bestows a noble name on a deed is hardly any consolation to the masses who must part with their hard-earned <i>money</i>. Little wonder that this ancient <i>craft</i> of getting <i>money</i> by calling it a <b>tribute</b> has given way to a name closer to how it feels to those who pay it: a tax."
