heisig: "By combining the primitive and the kanji of the last two frames and reading the results, we get: <i>by one's side</i> . . . <i>craft</i>. Conveniently, the <b>left</b> has traditionally been considered the &quot;sinister&quot; <i>side</i>, where dark and occult <i>crafts</i> are cultivated. Note how the second stroke droops over to the <b>left</b> and is longer than the first."

## Heisig story:

By combining the primitive and the kanji of the last two frames and reading the results, we get: <i>by one's side</i> . . . <i>craft</i>. Conveniently, the <b>left</b> has traditionally been considered the &quot;sinister&quot; <i>side</i>, where dark and occult <i>crafts</i> are cultivated. Note how the second stroke droops over to the <b>left</b> and is longer than the first.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 19-2-2008(92): The<strong> LEFT</strong> <em>side</em> of my brain <em>posesses</em> the faculties needed for logical <em>crafts</em>, like engineering.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe">stereovibe</a>] 4-2-2008(65): The<strong> left</strong> <em>side</em> of my brain, is for <em>crafts</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 26-5-2010(49): <strong>FOR THOSE ABOUT TO PUZZLE OVER THE CHANGING STROKE ORDER, IT&#039;S THIS SIMPLE:</strong> Look at the second primitive! Here, the first stroke of <em>by one&#039;s side</em> should match the first stroke of <em>craft</em> so that the stroke direction alternates in writing. So 左 is written horizontal, vertical, horizontal... 右 is written vertical, horizontal, vertical... 有 is vertical, horizontal, vertical... etc. (The ONLY exception to this rule comes with elbow [<a href="../743">masculine/male</a> (#743 雄) 雄 ], which is written horizontal, vertical, vertical(ish)...).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/martin">martin</a>] 22-11-2005(35): To remember which one is right/left, think &quot;(l)Eft&quot;, as it contains the katakana &quot;e&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kalin">kalin</a>] 22-6-2008(13): To distinguish<strong> left</strong> from right, the sideways H always reminds me that it is <em>hidari</em>, the Japanese word for<strong> left</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 18-9-2008(11): 工 will be the last one<strong> left</strong>.
