## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PrettyKitty">PrettyKitty</a>] 11-9-2007(180): The<strong> plantation</strong> is where we get our Christmas trees. We pick them out at Thanksgiving to be sure we get a good one.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 16-4-2007(43): During <em>Thanksgiving</em>, all the <em>trees</em> on the <strong>plantation</strong> celebrate the harvest. It&#039;s a good time for them, too.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 10-10-2007(33): During the <em>harvest festival</em>, all the <em>trees</em> on the <strong>plantation</strong> celebrate what a good job they did producing fruit.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 1-7-2008(19): All <em>ten trees</em> at the<strong> plantation</strong> rebelled and destroyed their human owners. They then had a <em>festive</em> celebration for their new found freedom.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 22-5-2007(11): On Thanksgiving day Kunta Kinte tied to a tree being slapped because he tried to flee from the<strong> plantation</strong> while the master was distracted with dinner.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sechapara">sechapara</a>] 14-11-2012(7): We don&#039;t have thanksgiving here in Australia, so I prefer to remember the thanksgiving primitive as &quot;paramedic&quot;, as that&#039;s who stitches you up with a needle after you&#039;ve been hit by a spear. So in this story, I imagine a paramedic searching amongst the trees of the<strong> plantation</strong> to find their patient. This also works out well for load 載 (359), as when the paramedic has their patient they load them into the ambulance.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jshield1">jshield1</a>] 23-4-2009(7): A<strong> plantation</strong> has <em>soil</em> with <em>wooden</em> <em>spears</em> in it.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 23-11-2008(4): The<strong> plantation</strong> exists to provide small <em>trees</em> for the <em>harvest feast</em>.
