heisig: "After seeing a constant <b>horizon</b> of <i>water</i>, <i>water</i> everywhere for months at sea, could there be anything more delightful to the eyes than to look astern and see the <i>ivy</i>-clad <i>cliffs</i> of land on a new <b>horizon</b>? Of course, you'd need the eyes of a stellar telescope to recognize that the vegetation was in fact <i>ivy</i>, but the phrase &quot;<i>ivy</i>-clad <i>cliffs</i>&quot; has such a nice ring to it that we won't worry about such details."

## Heisig story:

After seeing a constant <b>horizon</b> of <i>water</i>, <i>water</i> everywhere for months at sea, could there be anything more delightful to the eyes than to look astern and see the <i>ivy</i>-clad <i>cliffs</i> of land on a new <b>horizon</b>? Of course, you'd need the eyes of a stellar telescope to recognize that the vegetation was in fact <i>ivy</i>, but the phrase &quot;<i>ivy</i>-clad <i>cliffs</i>&quot; has such a nice ring to it that we won't worry about such details.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun">sutebun</a>] 10-9-2007(230): Try to reverse Heisig&#039;s story in this Kanji: imagine being trapped in one of those prison towers on an ivy cladcliff like in the movies. From your prison ontop the ivy clad cliff all you can see in the distant<strong> horizon</strong> is nothing but water.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jljzen">jljzen</a>] 3-1-2009(72): From the water, I can see the ivy-clad-cliffs on the<strong> horizon</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 8-5-2008(39): Over the WATER and past the<strong> HORIZON</strong> there is said to be a CLIFF that holds a very rare JEWEL.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mdspencer">mdspencer</a>] 14-4-2008(17): Across the <em>water</em>, I can see <em>ivy</em> covered <em>cliffs</em> on the<strong> horizon</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 23-3-2007(11): Since Hesig doesn&#039;t have another Kanji with the keyword of &quot;shore&quot; it might be worth pointing out to folks here that this is the alternate meaning for this kanji asides from<strong> horizon</strong>. Also meshes well with Hesig&#039;s story spotting those Ivy clad Cliffs on the<strong> horizon</strong>. Spotting green and beautiful shore-land off in the distance across the water!!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crd88">crd88</a>] 2-4-2010(8): Japan is a mountainous archipelago. When looking off into the<strong> horizon</strong> one can only see <em>water</em>, <em>cliffs</em>, and more <em>land</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LanternWorkshop">LanternWorkshop</a>] 5-3-2013(5): &quot;Somewhere beyond this<strong> horizon</strong> of neverending <em>water</em>...&quot; said the <em>dirty</em> pirate. &quot;<em>Cliff</em> of <em>jewels</em>! <em>Cliff</em> of <em>jewels</em>!&quot; answered his parrot, <em>Ivy</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wulfgar">wulfgar</a>] 21-7-2009(5): YARRR! Land hoe captain. In the<strong> horizon</strong> I see <em>Ivy clad cliffs</em>. YARR that is good news. I have been sick of seeing <em>water</em> 360 degrees around me for months on end :).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndyP">AndyP</a>] 26-6-2008(5): From my resting spot atop the ivy covered cliff all I could see was a watery ocean stretching across the<strong> horizon</strong> before me.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/phaedrine">phaedrine</a>] 3-10-2012(3): The best<strong> horizon</strong>, when you&#039;ve been on the <em>water</em> too long, is the sight of <em>cliffs</em> covered in <em>ivy</em>.
