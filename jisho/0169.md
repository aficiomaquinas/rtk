heisig: If you look into the flickering of a <i>fire</i> for a long time and then turn aside, you will see <b>spots</b> before your eyes. Although nobody ever thought of such a thing before - as least as far as know, they didn't - imagine using those <b>spots</b> as a technique for <i>fortune-telling</i>. The old witch sits before her <i>cauldron</i> and watches the <b>spots</b> that show up when she turns to look at you, and from that <i>tells your fortune</i>. Think of it as a kind of <b>spot</b>-check on your future.
