heisig: "On the left we see a mound of <i>dirt</i>, and to the right <i>flowers</i> made to <i>fit</i> together. The two sides combine to create a great <b>pagoda</b> made of <i>dirt</i>, with <i>flowers</i> by the tens of thousands <i>fitted</i> together for the roofing of each of the layers. Be sure to put yourself in the scene and <i>fit</i> a few of the <i>flowers</i> in place yourself so that the image works its way into memory with full force."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 14-8-2007(165): In order to build a<strong> pagoda</strong> in this small Japanese garden everything has to <em>fit</em>: the <em>soil</em> to the left and the <em>flowers</em> in the upper right corner. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xeyes">xeyes</a>] 21-5-2007(48): Pictograph-o-rama. This is a corner of a Japanese garden, with a small mound of <em>soil</em> on the left, and a little concrete<strong> pagoda</strong> in the front with <em>flowers</em> behind it. (To my eye, the <em>fit</em> looks a lot like a little<strong> pagoda</strong> anyway. This may or may not cause confusion for you, though...). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 13-7-2007(39): The <em>ground</em> next to the<strong> pagoda</strong> could barely <em>fit</em> all the <em>flowers</em> the empress wanted planted. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic">anthropic</a>] 7-7-2008(34): Thankfully I was in a <strong>pagoda</strong> when I, ummm, <em>soil</em>ed myself, the <em>flowers</em> covered up the smell and the mess <em>fit</em> out one of the holes in the side while no one was watching... 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yasser">Yasser</a>] 9-11-2008(23): A<strong> pagoda</strong> is a place of harmony in Japan. This means that even the &quot;soil&quot; where &quot;flowers&quot; are planted must &quot;fit&quot; together (good for remembering the order of writing). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eigoosaka">eigoosaka</a>] 5-2-2009(15): A<strong> pagoda</strong> should <em>fit</em> into it&#039;s surroundings in just the same way that <em>flowers</em> <em>fit</em> into <em>soil</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samesong">samesong</a>] 30-6-2008(8): I&#039;ve decided to turn   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/合">合</a>   into &quot;Rayden&quot; from Mortal Kombat (you can see his funny hat and his face). So in Mortal Kombat, you have to climb the <em>pagoda</em> built of <em>roses</em> and <em>dirt</em> to fight Rayden at the very top. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Phil2Musashi">Phil2Musashi</a>] 25-3-2009(7): A<strong> pagoda</strong> was once a simple stupa: A mound of dirt with flowers fitted to it. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(6): I wanted to build a <strong>pagoda</strong> in my garden, but first I had to move all the extra <em>soil</em> to the left and every last <em>flower</em> to the upper right corner. Only then could I <em>fit</em> my beloved <strong>pagoda</strong> into the bottom right corner. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 13-11-2009(6): Around the<strong> pagoda</strong>, we dug up the <em>dirt</em> to plant <em>rose</em>s, a good <em>fit</em> for the garden.
