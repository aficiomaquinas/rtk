4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog">stupiddog</a>] 28-12-2009(13): Unfortunately, this must be a sad story. Poachers lure the elefants with <strong>buds</strong> (of <em>flowers</em>) so they can kill them to get their <em>ivory</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/efeilliaid">efeilliaid</a>] 27-2-2010(5): The kanji for &quot;tusk&quot; may as well resemble a small elephant. So, a small elephant&#039;s<strong> bud</strong>s (nubs) become tusks later, but for now they are &quot;buds&quot;, which brings up the association with flowers. &quot;The <em>bud</em>ding tusks - actually &#039;nubs&#039; became a focal point in this my first sculpture.&quot; <a href="http://www.paintingsofwildlife.com/sculpture.html">http://www.paintingsofwildlife.com/sculpture.html</a>.
