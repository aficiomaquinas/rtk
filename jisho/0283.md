## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Georgi87">Georgi87</a>] 3-4-2008(93): I used my pants to make a rope, which I then used to<strong> escape</strong> from prison; hence the naked, hairy legs running along the road!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton">atomiton</a>] 1-3-2010(64): MARIO KART: When you&#039;re blasting down the <strong>road</strong> in Mario Kart, it&#039;s REALLY hard to<strong> escape</strong> from <strong>turtle shells</strong>. Especially the red and blue ones!!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977">mameha1977</a>] 30-9-2007(60): When your wifes <em>legs get hairy</em> (<a href="../235">portent</a> (#235 兆)) its time to hit the <em>road</em> and<strong> escape</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 11-1-2006(34): A scene right out of a 30&#039;s Cartoon. A tortoise in black-white striped jailsuit is making his<strong> escape</strong> from the prison, sirens howling and lightthrowers searching the road, where the tortoise in painful s lowness walks away looking scared.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 18-12-2007(18): If you used the meaning &quot;a person&#039;s back&quot; in <a href="../235">portent</a> (#235 兆), you will have it easy here. Adopting Georgi87: I used my pants to make a rope, which I used then to<strong> escape</strong> from prison; which is why you can see <em>my back</em> while I run along the <em>road</em>!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jaunty">Jaunty</a>] 14-6-2009(14): I picture someone riding a giant <em>turtle</em> down the <em>road</em> to<strong> escape</strong> from the cops!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anroo">anroo</a>] 1-8-2009(12): <strong>Escape</strong> down the road when you recieve an <em>omen/portent</em> warning of danger.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samueruht">samueruht</a>] 19-1-2008(10): The turtle promised to marry the pig, but she is having second thoughts and now the <em>turtle</em> is in the <em>road</em> trying to<strong> escape</strong> from the pig who is on her <a href="../539">pursue</a> (#539 逐). (see story in <a href="../539">pursue</a> (#539 逐) &amp; <a href="../540">consummate</a> (#540 遂)).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/swiftman">swiftman</a>] 18-5-2009(8): To avoid death, a turtle must<strong> escape</strong> the road.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 2-2-2006(7): I used the same image I used when remembering the japanese word that this kanji signifies - nigeru. I pictured the 18thC American colonial &#039;niggeru&#039; Uncle Tom during his<strong> escape</strong> from slavery, imagine how he is feeling (<em>portent</em>) as he hears the pack chasing him down on the <em>road</em>.... (Apologies for the terrible word. It helps remembering though).
