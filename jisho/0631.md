2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 10-2-2008(191): Tip: If you are confusing this keyword,<strong> remorse</strong>, with <a href="../625">repent</a> (#625 悔) and <a href="../1460">regret/resentment</a> (#1460 恨), then note that<strong> rEMOrse</strong> contains EMOtion.
