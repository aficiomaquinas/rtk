## Heisig story:

<i>Soil/ground</i> . . . <i>top hat</i> . . . <i>-times</i> . . . <i>nightbreak</i>. With kanji as difficult as this one, it generally pays to toy with the various connotations of its primitives before settling on one image. Aim for as much simplicity as you can.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jinkouchinou">jinkouchinou</a>] 12-6-2009(12): It&#039;s the oldest trick in the books. A filibuster!

Now imagine her stepping up to the<strong> podium</strong> to collect an Oscar, for that truly chilling performance, alongside an <em>ALIEN</em> in a <em>top-hat</em> for the occasion. (I take <a href="../v4/586">-times</a> (#586 回) to mean <em>ALIEN</em>).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/steen505">steen505</a>] 21-9-2009(6): Why do we have to watch the same dirty politicians in top hats on their<strong> podium</strong>s saying the same thing countless times on the nightbreak news?
