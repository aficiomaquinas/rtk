## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiddle">fiddle</a>] 28-12-2006(239): When you are<strong> self-effacing</strong> you use words to concurrently bring yourself down and make yourself look better.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 9-7-2009(94): Try to compliment a Japanese person and they&#039;ll interrupt you by saying<strong> self-effacing</strong> <em>words concurrently</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 14-4-2007(61): Though the man&#039;s <em>words</em> were<strong> self-effacing</strong>, his actions <em>concurrently</em> made it clear that his modesty was false.

That is, he waits for someone to speak, then speaks at the same time. When the other person stops speaking he stops as well, thinking nobody noticed he was speaking, but having said aloud whatever he had to say anyway.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tryllid">tryllid</a>] 27-10-2008(12): Say + Concurrently:<strong> Self-effacing</strong> people <em>say</em> little about their accomplishments even while they are <em>concurrently</em> working on multiple tasks.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 21-3-2010(7): Like we always do with keigo, when you are<strong> self-effacing</strong> you use WORDS to CONCURRENTLY bring yourself down and make the other person look better. (Thanks fiddle) NOTE: this is the kanji used in 謙譲語 (humble language in japanese, for ex &quot;itadaku&quot;).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zanzibar">zanzibar</a>] 31-5-2009(7): The WORDS of CASANOVA lure you in because they are so<strong> self-effacing</strong> and humble.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meeatcookies">meeatcookies</a>] 9-4-2012(2): Just a typical Japanese conversation, where people <em>concurrently say</em><strong> self-effacing</strong> <em>words</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 10-1-2010(2): A very<strong> self-effacing</strong> person will say <em>words</em> and <em>concurrently</em> try to take them back.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 31-12-2009(2): Japanese love<strong> self-effacing</strong> speech. They pack so many syllables in, it sounds like words coming concurrently.
