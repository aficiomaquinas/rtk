## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau23">dilandau23</a>] 5-11-2006(228): Children going around the<strong> mulberry</strong> <em>tree</em> singing &quot;This is the way we wash our <em>crotch</em>, wash our <em>crotch</em>, wash our <em>crotch</em>...&quot;. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 1-11-2007(97): Imagine kids <em>all over</em> the top of a<strong> mulberry</strong> <em>tree</em>, sitting astride limbs so that their weight is on their <em>crotches</em>. (Mulberry trees have big sprawling limbs that run horizontally or at shallow angles making them easy to climb and sit in. I have an old<strong> mulberry</strong> in my yard, and my kids are in it constantly). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy">howdycowdy</a>] 2-4-2008(37): According to Wikipedia, &quot;unripe [MULBERRY] fruit and green parts of the plant have a white sap that is intoxicating and mildly hallucinogenic.&quot; When looking at the<strong> MULBERRY</strong> <em>tree</em>, some have hallucinated that they are seeing <em>crotches, crotches everywhere</em>! 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/strider62590">strider62590</a>] 9-7-2009(21): Mulberries taste like crotch. This is a pictograph of the crotchberry tree. Look at all the ripe berries up top! 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 12-12-2008(13): Do you see the three students <em>sitting cross-legged</em> on the <em>tree</em> eating<strong> mulberry</strong>? 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 16-4-2009(10): A scene in an anime of <em>three</em> schoolgirls around the<strong> mulberry</strong> <em>tree</em> singing &quot;Here we go round the<strong> mulberry</strong> bush.&quot; Like way too many similar animes, you can&#039;t help noticing that the camera switches to an unusual number of <em>crotch shots</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zwarte_kat">zwarte_kat</a>] 18-4-2007(10): The<strong> mulberry</strong> game: 3 crotches are sitting in a tree, and you have to throw mulberries in the holes. The top one is the most points! 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiisu">kiisu</a>] 17-3-2008(7): Well . This is what we do to pedophiles. Cut off their crotches and hang them in a tree. Look there at that<strong> mulberry</strong> tree. Three already up there! 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mavelle">mavelle</a>] 25-1-2011(5): <em>Hard Gay</em> (primitive: Masaki Sumitani = Japanese comedian) pelvic trusting the<strong> mulberry</strong> tree three times. フオオオオオオオオ！. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/washburn1981">washburn1981</a>] 11-3-2010(4): I planted <em>three nu</em> (ヌヌヌ) <em>trees</em> around the edge of my yard; each of them was a <strong>mulberry</strong> tree.
