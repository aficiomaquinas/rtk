heisig: "The primitive for <i>mouth</i> and the character for <i>thousand</i> naturally form the idea of <b>tongue</b> if one thinks of a <i>thousand mouths</i> able to speak the same language, or as we say, &quot;sharing a common <b>tongue</b>.&quot; It is easy to see the connection between the idiom and the kanji if you take its image literally: a single <b>tongue</b> being passed around from <i>mouth</i> to <i>mouth</i>."
