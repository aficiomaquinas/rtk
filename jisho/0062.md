Western mythical imagination has old &quot;Father Time&quot; leaning on his sickle with a <b>newborn babe</b> crawling around his <i>legs</i>, the idea being that the circle of birth and-death goes on. This is the first of three times that the kanji for <i>olden times</i> will appear as a primitive element in another kanji, so try to make the most of it."
