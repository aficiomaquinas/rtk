## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 8-12-2006(279): In the <em>capital</em> they have been having hearings<strong> concerning</strong> bioethics and bioengineering they call as their first witness a <em>chihuahua</em> with <em>one human leg</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BigAmish">BigAmish</a>] 15-8-2008(58): Ahem...<strong>CONCERNING</strong> your recent science fair project, it was a <em>CAPITAL</em> idea, but the <em>CHIHUAHUA with a HUMAN LEG</em> is freaking out the other contestants! 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 2-5-2009(44): Note: <a href="../2087">understandably</a> <span class="index">(#2087 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/尤">尤</a>)</span> In the capital, there are hearings<strong> concerning</strong> bioengineering. Understandably, the piece of evidence that those in attendance found most shocking was the chihuahua with a human leg. Adapted from taijuando&#039;s version. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tornadic_Indignation">Tornadic_Indignation</a>] 31-7-2009(17): OBVIOUSLY IT&#039;D BE<strong> CONCERNING</strong> IF SOME GUY CUT OFF ONE OF HIS CHIHUAHUA&#039;S LEGS AND TRADED IT WITH ONE OF HIS OWN AND THEN POSTED THE PICTURES ON SOME INTERNET FORUM USING ALL <em>CAPITAL</em> LETTERS LIKE THIS WHILE TYPING. I WOULD BE VERY MUCH AFRAID. YES. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 8-4-2007(11): In<strong> Concerning</strong> Hobbits, Tolkien writes about Hobbiton, which is sort of the <em>capital</em> of the Shire. Understandably, they keep chihuahuas as dogs, and one of them has a human leg. Magic, probably. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yuta73">Yuta73</a>] 6-10-2011(7): Hint: This is the only time   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/京">京</a>   appears at left!. (Considering RTK1, RTK2 or any other official list up to Oct-2011). 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tanaquil">tanaquil</a>] 27-3-2010(5): When they move to the <em>capital</em>, most people are <em>understandably</em> (2087) <strong>concerned</strong> about <strong>finding work</strong>. (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/就">就</a>   =<strong> concerning</strong>; finding employment). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 5-12-2008(4): <strong>Concerning</strong> <em>capital</em> affairs, there appears to be a new politician on the rise. The Taco Bell <em>chihuahua</em> has chopped off a leg, replaced it with a human leg, and now claims to be human, so he can run for Governor of New Mexico. &#039;Yo quiero your vote, senors, I&#039;m really human.&#039; Since he has the popular vote now, the other candidates are naturally quite <strong>concerned</strong>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 6-2-2007(4): Of slight cause for <strong>concern</strong> is the new cos-play restaurant in the <em>capital</em> where the <em>waitresses</em> are really dressed up <em>chiuahuas</em>! Sounds like a<strong> concerning</strong> <strong>post</strong>   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/｢就職」">｢就職」</a>   to me! 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Inny+Jan">Inny+Jan</a>] 22-6-2012(3): A genetically modified <em>chihuahua with one human leg</em> escaped from the <em>capital</em> and is at large. I don&#039;t know about you but I find this quite<strong> concerning</strong>.
