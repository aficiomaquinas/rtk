heisig: "The primitive to the left, you will recall from Frame 137, represents <i>water</i>. To the right, we see the kanji for <i>eternity</i>. Knowing how much children like <b>swimming</b>, what could be a better image of <i>eternal</i> bliss than an endless expanse of <i>water</i> to <b>swim</b> in without a care in the world?"
