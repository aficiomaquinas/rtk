## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 22-3-2007(300): <strong>Chrysanthemum</strong> <em>flower</em> consists of many tiny petals, just like many <em>rice</em> grains <em>bound up</em> together. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 5-9-2007(58): [+astgt]<strong> Chrysanthemum</strong> is a terrorist orginization whose sole objective is to tie up <em>Condi Rice</em>. One day, <em>Condi Rice</em> is standing outside when a group of<strong> chrysanthemum</strong> agents swoop in from the sides, <em>bound</em> her up with<strong> chrysanthemum</strong> rope, and dash off. They leave a lone yellow<strong> chrysanthemum</strong> flower on top of the <em>bound</em> <em>Condi Rice</em> as a sign to let her discoverers know who committed this brave and noble act. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 27-11-2008(39): History: “Around the 8th century A.D., the<strong> chrysanthemum</strong> appeared in Japan. So taken were the Japanese with this flower that they adopted a single flowered<strong> chrysanthemum</strong> as the crest and official seal of the Emperor. Japan also has a National<strong> Chrysanthemum</strong> Day, which is called the Festival of Happiness.” Mnemonic: <em>flower</em> that looks like a lot of <em>grains</em> <em>bound</em> together. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 21-4-2008(20): <strong>Chrysanthemum</strong> is a <em>flower</em> that is as intimately <em>bound up</em> with Japan as gohan. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyreia">Hyreia</a>] 11-3-2009(16): I&#039;m not a florist, I had to see what a<strong> chrysanthemum</strong> looked like: <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/73/IMG_2967.JPG">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/73/IMG_2967.JPG</a> And I&#039;m happy with what I see. The pistils(?) in the middle and the budding flower on the left both look like grains of <em>rice</em> somewhat, but <em>bound</em> together and on a <em>flower</em>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 9-1-2008(9): Unaware that in Japan the<strong> chrysanthemum</strong> <em>flower</em> is used at funerals, you bring a bunch of them, <em>bound together</em> into a bouquet, to a wedding. To celebrate the bride and groom, <em>rice</em> is thrown, which gets lodged in between the flower petals. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 13-11-2009(8): Japan&#039;s national <em>flower</em>, it <em>binds together</em> all that is Japanese, even <em>rice</em>, their staple food. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 29-1-2008(8): Just pay attention to the Japanese Imperial Seal (which is a CHRYSANTEMUN) and think of it as an artificial <strong>flower</strong> made with <strong>bound up rice</strong>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan</a>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 4-4-2007(5): <strong>Chrysanthemum</strong> is a terrorist organization whose logo features a single flower on the top and <em>bound</em> and gagged <em>Condy Rice</em> at the bottom. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/orangewonder">orangewonder</a>] 14-11-2011(4): <strong>Chrysanthemum</strong> sushi! The <em>flower</em> on top, <em>bound-up rice</em> underneath. Yummy... no?
