heisig: "The single <i>gate</i> is used here not in order to represent one <i>gate</i>, but many of them, indeed a <i>meeting of gates</i>. Add <i>mouth</i> (as an entrance here) and you end up with <b>godown</b>. That should help keep this character distinct from <i>warehouse</i> (Frame 633)."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 5-10-2007(256): (Warning-this one is crude) Imagine a<strong> godown</strong> (dockside warehouse) where you can <em>meet</em> girls who will <em>godown</em> on you with their <em>mouth</em>. To keep the place a bit of a secert, they only have one <em>gate</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 26-10-2005(56): Hint : the &quot;godown&quot; is like a warehouse, it&#039;s on the docks and mostly in Asia. To make an image distinct from that of &quot;warehouse&quot; or &quot;storehouse&quot;, etc, I picture the goods stored there, piled up on pallets really high, and thus they have to &quot;godown&quot; before they can be taken outside. The front of this<strong> godown</strong> is a &quot;<em>meeting of small gates</em>&quot;, i.e. a row of gates through which goods come in and out. The <em>mouth</em> can be an opening somewhere in the back, or the top, where cranes lift down the goods. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 27-3-2008(48): <strong>Note:</strong> this is not <em>gate</em> but actually a variation of <em>door</em> and is written as such, with the vertical stroke last not first. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matsuyamakiwi">matsuyamakiwi</a>] 29-6-2008(30): Imagine a mafia<strong> godown</strong> at the docks where shifty mafia types <em>meet</em> and lots of dodgy deals<strong> godown</strong>. This is a very secret place, so there is only one <em>gate</em>, and to enter you have to say the password with your <em>mouth</em>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 9-9-2007(22): A <strong>godown</strong> is an old style warehouse where goods were temporarily stacked stacked to the <em>roof</em>(meeting). A series of <em>gates</em> with <em>mouths</em>(doors) were used access them for shipment. (Primitive <em>EAST INDIA TRADING</em>) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image</a>:WarehousesinAmsterdam.JPG. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bandwidthjunkie">bandwidthjunkie</a>] 9-1-2009(19): This kanji also means granary, and that doesn&#039;t clash with any other keywords, so if like me you have no idea what a<strong> godown</strong> is (apparently a Malaysian warehouse! sometimes I think Heisig is just taking the piss) maybe it&#039;s best to change the word. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shinsen">shinsen</a>] 25-11-2011(11): <strong>Godown</strong> is a warehouse so small, the only thing that <em>fits</em> inside is <em>half a gate</em>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 8-3-2009(8): The<strong> godown</strong> granary (dockside warehouse) has a been <strong>fitt</strong>ed with a <strong>double door</strong> that looks a little like part of a gate. [If I remember the kanji for <a href="../253">fit</a> <span class="index">(#253 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/合">合</a>)</span> and <a href="../1076">door</a> <span class="index">(#1076 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/戸">戸</a>)</span> and double the door I have what I need] As a primitive I&#039;m using granary instead of<strong> godown</strong>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 9-7-2007(6): A<strong> godown</strong> is a warehouse where <em>Bill Gates</em> holds <em>meetings</em> and things &quot;go down&quot; by word of <em>mouth</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mlorenz">mlorenz</a>] 30-3-2011(4): Near the<strong> godown</strong> is where we&#039;ll <em>meet</em>: look for the <em>single gate</em>. And keep your <em>mouth</em> shut about it!
