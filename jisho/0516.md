heisig: "<i>Water</i> . . . <i>scorpion</i>. It would be easy to slip into a &quot;lazy image&quot; in cases like this one, picturing, let us say, a <i>scorpion</i> near the <i>water</i>. But if you picture rather a <i>scorpion</i> letting its venom out <i>drop by drop</i> until it has made a whole <b>pond</b> of the stuff, the image is more likely to remain fixed."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/khooks">khooks</a>] 13-7-2008(110): Remember the story of the <em>scorpion</em> that begged the turtle for a ride across the<strong> pond</strong>? Halfway across the <em>water</em>, the <em>scorpion</em> stung the turtle on the neck and they both sank to the bottom.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yvanc">yvanc</a>] 14-6-2007(62): Water scorpions loves to live in the<strong> pond</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 13-7-2008(40): The<strong> POND</strong> was infested with WATER SCORPIONS.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stshores24">stshores24</a>] 11-6-2008(13): You thought water snakes were bad...this<strong> pond</strong> has WATER SCORPIONS. One sting and you&#039;re dead.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lena1849">lena1849</a>] 28-6-2010(10): Take out the 1st layer of <em>soil</em> in &quot;ground&quot; 地 , and add <em>water</em>. You&#039;ve got a<strong> pond</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dnanoodle">dnanoodle</a>] 18-11-2009(8): The water scorpion is a peculiar beast, letting poison out until it has a whole<strong> pond</strong> of it. It then feeds on anything unfortunate enough to touch the deadly<strong> pond</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skellyfish">skellyfish</a>] 12-2-2009(7): My mother told me that if I see a<strong> pond</strong> (notorious for their questionable water quality), I should drop a SCORPION into the WATER to see if it&#039;s clean and safe. If the SCORPION gasps, burns up, or passes out, the WATER is probably poisoned or dangerous. (Picture the splash, and a scorpion writhing and flailing around in the water).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 18-10-2008(7): Think of this<strong> pond</strong> as being one you can swim in, (there is no kanji for swimming pool for it to be confused with). It has the latest in deterrents to stop children urinating in the pool. Scorpians swim up from the bottom and sting the offending boy on his...

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zardoz73">zardoz73</a>] 10-8-2008(3): Don&#039;t go near that<strong> pond</strong>--it&#039;s full of <strong>scorpions</strong>. The desert has a lot of really smart scorpions; they wait until a<strong> pond</strong> grows <strong>drop</strong> by <strong>drop</strong>, and then wait some more for an animal to come by. Then, when they do, scorpion attack!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/flameiguana">flameiguana</a>] 5-9-2012(2): <em>Water</em> dripped out of the giant <em>scorpion</em>&#039;s tail until a<strong> pond</strong> was formed.
