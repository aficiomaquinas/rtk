## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 30-5-2007(139): Hey, <em>Spidey</em>! Eat that <em>turkey</em> if you want, but make sure you eat some<strong> fiber</strong>s: you want spidey <em>threads</em>, don&#039;t ya?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 28-5-2007(88): If you want to increase your<strong> fiber</strong> intake, just leave on those <em>threads</em> that are used to sew up the stuffed <em>turkey</em> and eat them too.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue">notgoing2argue</a>] 1-8-2007(65): Feeling mischievous while shopping, Spiderman throws his web into the cavity of a <em>turkey</em>. He chuckles, &quot;That ought to raise the <em>turkey</em>&#039;s<strong> FIBER</strong> content.&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 26-1-2008(32): When <em>Spider-Man</em> first made his suit, he was so fixated on the textile aspect, on making sure all of the <strong>fibres</strong> were sturdy, he didn&#039;t realize till he finished that he&#039;d made it with a <em>turkey</em> design on the chest instead of a spider. He felt like a real <em>turkey</em> then (that&#039;s the sort of campy insult he might use).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bonitoclub">bonitoclub</a>] 29-8-2008(20): <em>Spiderman</em> needs more <strong>fibre</strong> so he eats <em>turkey</em> sandwiches on wholewheat bread.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Atomik">Atomik</a>] 4-2-2010(17): With<strong> fiber</strong> optic <em>threads</em>, I can communicate with people halfway across the globe in <em>Turkey</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 13-2-2008(9): An <em>ostrich</em> (a big bird) finds what the animal thinks is a tasty worm. So it starts pulling with its beak with all its strenght, puzzled about what looks to be an unusually long worm. Surprise! It wasn&#039;t a worm, it was a <em>thread</em> from an optic-<strong>fiber</strong> installation! Stupid bird.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joxn_costello">joxn_costello</a>] 9-1-2009(7): It&#039;s a little-known fact that <em>Spider-man</em>&#039;s web spinners use as raw material a<strong> fiber</strong> made from turkey feathers.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 27-4-2013(6): I was eating a TURKEY sandwich and oops! I swallowed a THREAD. (maybe it came from the turkey packaging). I asked my doctor, but he said &quot;Don&#039;t worry,<strong> FIBER</strong> is good for our health&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 9-2-2010(6): <a href="Http://www.thisnext.com/show/item-images/5F699C51/">Http://www.thisnext.com/show/item-images/5F699C51/</a> ^^^^^^ lol.
