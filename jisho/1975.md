## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberstuber">uberstuber</a>] 21-6-2007(205): I put all those useless <em>business cards</em> at the<strong> bottom</strong> of a <em>cave</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 8-5-2007(93): At the<strong> bottom</strong> of the <em>cave</em> you find a <em>meishi</em>: &quot;LOST? DIAL 1-800-...&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Weber">Weber</a>] 28-2-2007(19): Its unlikely for you to have a card if you&#039;re low in society. People living in caves must be at the<strong> bottom</strong> of society, so they sure as hell don&#039;t have one.

All you have left are a few <em>business cards</em>, and you&#039;re desperately hoping someone calls and offers you business.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 11-3-2008(9): At the<strong> BOTTOM</strong> of a <strong>cave</strong> you find a <strong>calling card</strong> that says: &quot;Arne Saknussemm&quot; (from &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot;).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 11-7-2009(7): I tend to throw all the <em>business cards</em> I receive to the<strong> bottom</strong> of a <em>cave</em> where no one will find them and have their feelings hurt.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Schwingy">Schwingy</a>] 20-5-2009(7): While visiting Batman in his Bat <em>Cave</em>, he gave me his <em>business card</em>. But he made a mistake; he gave me his Bruce Wayne <em>business card</em> Now I know his identity! Haha! I was so excited I accidentally threw the business card up and it fell all the way to the<strong> bottom</strong> of the cave. Crap.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blurp76">blurp76</a>] 7-5-2009(7): In Japan there&#039;s exchange of business cards even at the<strong> bottom</strong> of caves.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 13-4-2008(7): DC has finally hit<strong> bottom</strong>. The latest plot of Batman: the Joker leaves his <em>calling card</em>, some kind of toy, at the<strong> bottom</strong> of the Batcave, and that&#039;s it.
