heisig: "<i>Awl</i> . . . <i>saber</i>. As we promised way back in frame 87, here at last is the kanji on which the primitive element of the same name is based. awl We include this element here because of its visible similarity to the element for bundle. Be sure to make a distinct image out of its composite ingredients: meeting . . . mouth . . . person. The stroke order follows the order of the elements exactly, but note how the person runs through the mouth. [8]"

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-9-2007(140): If it helps, make the awl primitive <strong>ice pick</strong> instead. They&#039;re basically the same thing. This kanji is an easy David vs. Goliath story of the <strong>icepick</strong> vs. the <em>saber</em>...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 2-7-2008(96): Every self-respecting ninja knows the story of &quot;The <em>Awl and the Sabre</em>&quot;. According to the legend, a woman once defended herself by using an <em>awl</em> against a <em>sabre</em>! She used to work all day with that <em>awl</em>. However, the bandit using the <em>sabre</em> had no skill. And thus the <em>awl</em> beat the <em>sabre</em>. And from there the saying goes : &quot;The <em>sabre</em> is powerless against the <em>awl</em>, if one can&#039;t use the <em>sabre</em>.&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 20-2-2008(73): ICE PICK primitive: How do you FIT a PERSON into a tight BOX (mouth primitive)? Poke holes in him with a ICE PICK, draining the blood and making the body smaller. STORY: If that does not work, take out your<strong> SABER</strong> and cut them up into neat pieces.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 9-4-2007(58): As a non-native speaker of English, I really couldn&#039;t work with the awl primitive, since I can&#039;t even imagine what kind of tool it would be. So, I had another look at the primitive and it practically screamed a different meaning: <em>fit together</em> and <em>person</em>, i.e. Frankenstein&#039;s Monster. // The crowd came after the monster of Frankenstein with sabres!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/diracbracket">diracbracket</a>] 13-1-2011(19): My light<strong> saber</strong> has an <em>awl</em> setting. When I toggle the switch, the beam shrinks down to a little spike. My light<strong> saber</strong> becomes a light <em>awl</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 15-1-2008(14): <strong>Awl primitive</strong>: The builders&#039; meeting was fairly informal, and even included entertainment. The stunt-builder picked a <em>person</em> from the audience and invited them onto the spinning wheel, where which he&#039;d throw <strong>awls</strong> and amaze everyone with his aim by not hitting the volunteer. Unfortunately, the very first one he threw went straight into the <em>person&#039;s</em> <em>mouth</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cheesemaster64">Cheesemaster64</a>] 4-5-2009(12): <strong>Ice pick</strong>: The penguins called the Eskimos to a meeting in an ice cave. Little did they know, it was a Eskimo MASSACRE. The penguins were armed with<strong> saber</strong>s and started slaughtering innocent Eskimos. However, the Eskimo men had their <em>icepicks</em>, and started to fight back! The women and children ran as fast as they could, and <em>people fled from the mouth of the cave</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kerth">Kerth</a>] 18-4-2010(11): This kanji actually stands for anciend tsurugi type sword (<a href="http://medieval2.heavengames.com/m2tw/history/miscellaneous_history_folder/japanese_weapons_folder/tsurugi.jpg">http://medieval2.heavengames.com/m2tw/history/miscellaneous_history_folder/japanese_weapons_folder/tsurugi.jpg</a>) inspired by chinese jian (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jian">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jian</a>). Similarly to jian, and unlike 刀 (katana), tsurugi was almost exclusively used for thrusting strikes, making it truly an <em>awl</em>-type <em>saber</em>. (By the way, in Japan 剣 is also used for jian instead of traditional chinese 劍, as well as for any other double-edged broadsword).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 19-9-2006(11): Awl your<strong> saber</strong>s are belong to us.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 30-12-2008(9): An <em>ice-pick</em> is as deadly as a <em><strong>saber</strong></em> in the right hands.
