## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 6-2-2007(174): Well, you usually use your <em>fingers</em> to<strong> throw</strong> objects used as <em>missile</em> weapons. Easy. By the way, for those of you looking for a less anachronistic image for the <em>missile</em> primitive as a modern rocket, try a slingshot. it&#039;s a <em>crotch</em> (originally a tree branch) that sends missile projectiles flying into/like the <em>wind</em>. And for this present kanji, it is something you naturally use with your fingers... 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 11-8-2009(169): <strong>If you use the primitive &quot;semen&quot; (flying in the wind from your crotch) instead of missile then all kanjis with this primitive will hilariously create a perfect story</strong>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 23-12-2007(59): RPG. A wizard <strong>throws</strong> magic <em>missiles</em> from the tip of his <em>fingers</em>. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 11-4-2008(35): He&#039;s a great pitcher. He can<strong> throw</strong> a split <em>finger</em> fastball that&#039;s like a <em>missile.</em>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RobMow">RobMow</a>] 19-8-2008(13): In Japan, where gun-control laws are strict, the desperate criminals have resorted to<strong> throw</strong>ing chopped-off <em>finger missiles</em> at each other. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ithil">ithil</a>] 24-10-2006(11): If you&#039;ve read (or watched) One Piece: Mr 5, from Baroque Works, used his <em>fingers</em> to<strong> throw</strong> some small <em>missiles</em>. These &#039;missiles&#039; were no more, no less, than little exploding snot balls. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 13-2-2009(10): Missile Primitive: When I let some AIR out from my CROTCH, I pray that a MISSILE does not accidentally slip out. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chameleoncoder">chameleoncoder</a>] 27-7-2009(9): You&#039;d have to be pretty strong to<strong> throw</strong> a <em>missile</em> with your <em>fingers</em>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 29-4-2006(7): The others are<strong> throw</strong>ing darts with their fingers, but you&#039;re a Real Man and use a small missile. Witness the look on their faces when your missile explodes as it hits the board. (as an aside,   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/投了">投了</a>   means resigning a game, and here you<strong> throw</strong> it with a bang indeed). 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mavelle">mavelle</a>] 26-1-2011(6): <em>semen</em>-fight!: Picking up <em>semen</em> with <em>fingers</em> and <strong>throw</strong>ing it at someone, would be something much more fun than a childish pillowfight.. (thanks to crystalcastlecreature for the primitive).
