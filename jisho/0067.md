heisig: "There simply is not a good phrase in English for the block often days which this character represents. So we resurrect the classical phrase, <b>decameron</b>, whose connotations the tales of Boccaccio have done much to enrich. Actually, it refers to a journey of ten <i>days</i> taken by a band of people - that is, a group of people <i>bound together</i> for the <i>days</i> of the <b>decameron</b>."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yukkuri_kame">yukkuri_kame</a>] 6-4-2009(218): Hesig should be BOUND for a DAY (or maybe 10 days - a<strong> decameron</strong>) for calling this Kanji<strong> DECAMERON</strong>. See <a href="../809">martyrdom</a> <span class="index">(#809 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/殉">殉</a>)</span>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pulse">Pulse</a>] 18-3-2012(165): <strong>Hint:</strong> <em>Here&#039;s info from Wikipedia regarding why this kanji exists, which helped me remember it:</em> [Japan also divides the month roughly into three 10-day periods. Each is called a jun (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/旬">旬</a>  ). The first is jōjun (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/上旬">上旬</a>  ); the second, chūjun (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/中旬">中旬</a>  ); the last, gejun (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/下旬">下旬</a>  ). These are frequently used to indicate approximate times, for example, &quot;the temperatures are typical of the jōjun of April&quot;; &quot;a vote on a bill is expected during the gejun of this month.&quot;]. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blahdi">blahdi</a>] 8-9-2009(85): What the fuck? 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 22-7-2007(70): If you bind up ten days, you get a<strong> decameron</strong>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/panikbuton">panikbuton</a>] 20-1-2008(33): For producing Titanic, James<strong> deCameron</strong> should be bound for 10 days. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 29-3-2009(31): HINT: All the stories seem to have &#039;10&#039; in them, but the primitive isn&#039;t featured, which is confusing. So my story: How many days were bound up in a<strong> decameron</strong>? It doesn&#039;t matter! 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kat1420">kat1420</a>] 10-3-2008(22): It would tie up a whole day to read The<strong> Decameron</strong>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fjolnir">fjolnir</a>] 10-10-2009(12): Heisig should be <em>bound</em> up for <strong>10 <em>day</em>s</strong> for calling this kanji<strong> decameron</strong>! 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asayoru">Asayoru</a>] 11-11-2010(6): The Japanese divide the months into three parts. Each part is made up of <strong>ten days</strong>. The <em>day</em>s are <em>bound</em> together so they make more sense. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sdnnet3">sdnnet3</a>] 18-1-2009(6): How many days are bound up in a<strong> decameron</strong>?
