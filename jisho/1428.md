## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 5-2-2007(176): A<strong> point</strong> is a extra little <em>hill</em> at the top of a <em>mountain</em>. We&#039;ll call it &#039;Fireman&#039;s<strong> Point</strong>&#039;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 4-12-2006(103): This actually means a high mountain. So, to cater to the keyword, it&#039;s surely obvious (ahem) that if something gets such a fine title as<strong> Point</strong>, it must be more magnificent than the average mountain. It&#039;s as if there was a hill on top of an average mountain, adding to its height.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pauline">Pauline</a>] 3-7-2006(29): There&#039;s a movie called &quot;The Englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain&quot;. The story is that English cartographer says that the mountain near a Welsh village is actually a hill (too low for a mountain), but the locals decide to make it a mountain (by making it higher). Let&#039;s say that in the end the <em>hill</em> got the title<strong> Point</strong> to mark it as a <em>mountain</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 8-1-2010(19): I chopped off the<strong> point</strong> of the <em>mountain</em> with my <em>axe</em>. Now it is just a hill.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Odieone">Odieone</a>] 30-12-2008(12): At some<strong> point</strong>, a <em>hill</em> becomes a <em>mountain</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paramausi">paramausi</a>] 23-6-2009(7): A hill on a mountain is an especially high<strong> point</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 25-1-2006(7): A mountain magically grows from under the <em>faeries hill</em>. Eventually the tip, or &quot;Point&quot; shows up.<strong> Point</strong> faery it is called...
