## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 19-1-2006(213): Note : the keyword is not a verb, think of a record book. This <em>acupuncturist</em> who uses <em>bamboo</em> in place of flowers to dilute <em>water</em> into his patients (see frame 227), managed somehow to appear on the<strong> register</strong> of acupuncturists. Chances are, he won&#039;t stay on the<strong> register</strong> for long. My image is close to that of gorgon&#039;s story.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 29-1-2006(106): This doctor dilutes (see 227) his patients with bamboo stalks rather than the flowers of a standard diluting acupuncturist hence he needs to be on the Bamboo Accumpunturist Diltuers (BAD)<strong> register</strong>. Pumping that much water into a body can be dangerous; see the huge bamboo stems with gallons of water sloshing in and out of the patient.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 20-11-2007(25): The <em>acupuncturist</em> was not very good. His <em>bamboo</em> needles made his patients cry copious amounts of <em>water</em>. He was put on a<strong> register</strong> of doctors to avoid.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 5-9-2007(16): After <em>diluting</em> your bad humours with flowers in Frame 217, the <em>acupuncturist</em> pulls out a <em>bamboo</em> slab and asks you to sign the<strong> register</strong>, including your e-mail address, so that you can receive periodic updates on special promotions and also read his blog.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 16-9-2009(14): The keyword refers to<strong> register</strong> as in an expense book. I imagine a wealthy housewife writing up her elaborate and unnecessary expenses in her<strong> register</strong> notebook: fancy <em>bamboo</em> flatware, sparkling <em>water</em>, her weekly trip to the <em>acupuncturist</em>, and so on...

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 8-7-2008(11): Hmmm, I don&#039;t think this <em>acupuncturist</em> is a<strong> register</strong>ed member of the homopathic acupuncturist union. The last guy I saw (in <a href="../227">dilute</a> (#227 薄)) knew exactly how to dilute my blood. This guy tried doing it with <em>bamboo</em> shafts, not flower stalks, and nearly killed me!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tritonxg">tritonxg</a>] 28-3-2010(6): [FR]registre japlt:N1 <strong>BO </strong>kanji&amp;kana:1490<em> bambou+eau+specialiste+1 goutte</em> =<em>kanji de diluer ( 薄 ) avec bambou à la place de fleur</em> <strong>registre de police pour les produits toxiques : </strong>le pharmacien écrit avec un pinceau de BAMBOU le nom de la Fleur dont il a fait une DILUTION toxique 家計簿 【かけいぼ】household account book 計算簿 【けいさんぼ】account book 出納簿 【すいとうぼ】cashbook 予約名簿 【よやくめいぼ】subscription list 名簿 【めいぼ】register of names.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 7-10-2012(5): You<strong> register</strong> a trademark to repair your <em>diluted</em> identity, replacing the flimsy flowers of <a href="../227">dilute</a> (#227 薄) with resilient <em>bamboo</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hugh2323">hugh2323</a>] 13-3-2011(4): BAMBOO diluted in WATER is a commonly used treatment in homoeopathy. No wonder they can&#039;t get on the<strong> REGISTER</strong> of real DOCTORS.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 25-11-2010(4): 簿記 , 鹵簿 , 計算簿 , 通知簿 , 家計簿 , 出納簿 , 予約名簿 , 名簿 <a href="../949">register</a> (#949 簿)ボ ...

Story: That doctor from 薄い <a href="../227">dilute</a> (#227 薄) who was using flowers to drain fluids? It turns out he was not using flowers, he was <em>DeFlowering</em> patients. As punishments, he was <em>Bamboo</em> caned, and now he is on the Sex offender <strong>Register</strong>.
