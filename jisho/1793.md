## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog">guidedog</a>] 3-3-2007(160): After a row husbands take their wives upsides down over the knee and<strong> slap</strong> them with their fingers on the bottom (if that doesn&#039;t get me banned…).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 21-5-2006(140): Here we have badly behaving HUSBANDs, whose wives have had them hung UPSIDE DOWN IN A ROW. Each wife approaches her HUSBAND, berates him, gives him a sharp<strong> SLAP</strong> in the face and, Three-Stooges style, pokes him in the eyes with her FINGERS.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 9-12-2006(46): A couple in a rowboat. The wife<strong> slap</strong>s the <em>husband</em> so hard with her <em>fingers</em> that the entire <em>boat</em> flips <em>upside-down</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 12-3-2009(11): I&#039;m the <em>husband</em>. I told my wife to lay <em>upside down</em> so I could have an easier time <em>fingering</em> her. Needless to say, I got a<strong> slap</strong> in the face.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 11-1-2009(9): The wife immediately regretted giving her <em>Berserker husband</em> the <em>finger</em> after he <strong>slapped</strong> her half way across the room. See <a href="../1785">row</a> (#1785 並).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 17-12-2006(9): <em>Fingers</em>, the thief, barely avoids a <strong>slap</strong> in the face. He&#039;s been stealing some attention from some guy&#039;s wife, but he manages to hang <em>upside down in a row</em> with some kids on the monkey bars, and the <em>husband</em> fails to notice him there among the kids.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 28-2-2008(8): This kanji is also used for &quot;Sumo.&quot; 相撲 (P); 角力 【すもう】 (n) sumo wrestling; (P). STORY: In professional SUMO only HUSBANDS participate (b/c they are old and experienced), and they use their HANDS to either<strong> SLAP</strong> each other out of the ring, or throw them UPSIDE DOWN into the first ROW of audience. (right primitive = SUMO WRESTLER).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KanjiVirtuoso">KanjiVirtuoso</a>] 24-12-2012(6): A wife &quot;in the mood&quot; gives her <em>husband</em> a playful<strong> slap</strong> on the behind as she walks past. Note that in this motion her <em>fingers</em> are all <em>in a row upside down</em> (pointing to the ground).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amillerchip">amillerchip</a>] 23-12-2011(6): This is a crazy Japanese game show where a wife has to identify her <em>husband</em> from an entire <em>row of upside down husbands</em> by<strong> slap</strong>ping him with her <em>fingers</em> and judging by the sound of the yell.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 20-6-2007(5): A row of would-be husbands line up to be picked. Those that are too horny just get a<strong> slap</strong>.
