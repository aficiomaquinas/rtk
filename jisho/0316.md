## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ibardell">ibardell</a>] 27-7-2007(260): The<strong> cottage</strong> is so small - it has an umbrella for the roof; soil for the floor and room for only one mouth.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 13-11-2006(57): Picture a <em>lidded crock</em> full of tasty<strong> cottage</strong> cheese... yum! Now all we need is an <em>umbrella</em> over it to protect the<strong> cottage</strong> cheese from the sun.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball">Thunderball</a>] 15-9-2007(25): The homeless man stuck an <em>umbrella</em> over his <em>lidded crock</em> in the country side and declared it his<strong> cottage</strong>. It looks just like a shack (しゃ) though! Under local government legislation, after 7 years, the &quot;cottage&quot; and land were his.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 18-6-2009(18): I call it my<strong> cottage</strong>, but it&#039;s really just an <em>umbrella</em> over a <em>dirty hole</em> in the ground.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elitentity">elitentity</a>] 31-1-2006(14): To further Heisig&#039;s explanation, imagine a<strong> cottage</strong> made out of a giant lidded crock and an umbrella. The mouth can also represent a door.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bexinkyushu">bexinkyushu</a>] 19-2-2011(9): I strongly advise calling the combination of elements 土 and 口 a <em>Hobbit</em>. This will come in use in future stories, and you&#039;ll be glad when you get to <em>ring</em> (no. 836 環 ). The <em>hobbit</em> more often than not has dirt on his head (from living under a hill), and sometimes wears a <em>garment</em> (no.396 衣 ). The <em>mouth</em> we see is his, grumbling about something or other. Story: The <em>Hobbit</em> built his<strong> cottage</strong> under the Hill, using an <em>umbrella</em> as a door, to seal the entrance from the elements and intruders.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kreios">kreios</a>] 24-11-2009(7): My grandma lives in a little English <strong>cottage</strong>, and by the door she keeps a great <em>lidded crock</em> for guests to keep their <em>umbrellas</em> in.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Oyabecory">Oyabecory</a>] 24-3-2013(5): My quaint <strong>cottage</strong>: an <em>umbrella</em> with a <em>dirt</em> floor and a <em>hole</em> in the ground for a toilet.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PositronLaser">PositronLaser</a>] 28-12-2008(5): I think this word actually means that the house that is built on the SOIL that has only one story (one MOUTH), which is the definition of<strong> cottage</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MiyuYamano">MiyuYamano</a>] 22-6-2012(4): A<strong> cottage</strong> is nothing more than a lidded crock under an umbrella.
