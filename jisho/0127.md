heisig: "The picture in this kanji is not a pleasant one. It shows a large and fluffy <i>St. Bernard dog</i> stretched out on a table all stuffed and stewed and garnished with vegetables, its paws in the air and an apple in its mouth. At each corner of the table sits an eager but empty <i>mouth</i>, waiting for the <b>utensils</b> to arrive so the feast can begin."

## Heisig story:

The picture in this kanji is not a pleasant one. It shows a large and fluffy <i>St. Bernard dog</i> stretched out on a table all stuffed and stewed and garnished with vegetables, its paws in the air and an apple in its mouth. At each corner of the table sits an eager but empty <i>mouth</i>, waiting for the <b>utensils</b> to arrive so the feast can begin.

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps">ceeeps</a>] 2-9-2007(184): Imagine four hungry <em>mouths</em> all sitting around the table. They are all banging their <strong>utensils</strong> on the table waiting for a <em>big</em> meal to be placed in the centre.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo">NooNoo</a>] 16-4-2008(53): Note: 器 by itself means <strong>container/caliber/vessel</strong>. And 食器 means eating<strong> utensil</strong>s (&quot;food container&quot;, hehe).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe">stereovibe</a>] 26-2-2008(39): Four <em>mouths</em> sit at the four corners of the table, waiting for their<strong> utensil</strong>s, ready to devour the large, spread eagled St. Bernard stretched out on the table!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lee101">lee101</a>] 28-7-2011(25): I swear RevTK has got too politically correct, I mean people on here are copying Heisig&#039;s original story only shortening it which is fine, yet they are getting dislikes, only due to the fact its about eating a dog!? Other instances include where people make slight reference to sex, race, violence - Heisig clearly states that it&#039;s fine to do this. (part 1, part two on the next frame).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/squirrelscuba">squirrelscuba</a>] 14-5-2010(13): Four jgirl&#039;s mouths surrounding my large<strong> utensil</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/silkcherryblossoms">silkcherryblossoms</a>] 27-5-2007(8): Four mouths eagerly await the arrival of<strong> utensil</strong>s. They just can&#039;t wait to eat some roast St. Bernard dog! Mmm boy, a tasty treat! But, how could they do that to a poor dog? Perhaps he left them one surprise too many, yes?

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wheezyheen">wheezyheen</a>] 11-7-2011(6): If someone is getting confused because some dictionaries use &#039;Dog&#039; instead of &#039;Big,&#039; it is because originally in olden times they wrote it with dog. Some time ago, they simplified it and took the drop off, changing it from &#039;dog&#039; to &#039;big.&#039; This also applies to the kanji after this, &#039;stinking&#039; Thus, you will sometimes see it written both ways, depending on how old the source is.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yasser">Yasser</a>] 12-8-2011(4): Four hungry Chinese <em>mouths</em> don&#039;t need<strong> utensil</strong>s to devour even a <em>St. Bernad</em>!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 8-8-2009(3): <em>4 open mouths</em> with<strong> utensil</strong>s enjoying feast while <em>St. Bernard</em> admist them enjoys its feast of scraps without<strong> utensil</strong>s.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bluedragon123">bluedragon123</a>] 4-6-2013(2): The four <em>boxes</em> contained some <em>large</em> <strong>utensils</strong>.
