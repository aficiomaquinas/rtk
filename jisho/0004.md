heisig: "This character is composed of two primitive elements, <i>mouth</i> and <i>human legs</i>,  both of which we will meet in the coming lessons. Assuming that you already knew how to write this kanji, we will pass over the &quot;story&quot; connected with it until later. Note how the second stroke is written left-to-right and then top-to-bottom. This is consistent with what we have already seen in the first three numbers and leads us to a general principle that will be helpful when we come to more complicated kanji later on: write north-to-south, west-to-east, northwest-to-southeast."
