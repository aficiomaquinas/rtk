There he is in the people&#039;s court, standing right next to Barry. Just as he&#039;s about to make a statement saying that he&#039;s known Barry his whole life and neither of them used steroids, the judge points out that the <strong>co-</strong>defendant still has what appears to be a needle sticking out of his <em>triceps</em>. Whoops.
