## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 13-2-2008(328): I bounce down the <em>road</em> on my <em>pogo stick</em>, easily getting through the dense<strong> traffic</strong>. (Note: New primitive: chop-seal + utilize = pogo stick. Because a <em>chop-seal</em> is long and thin with a rubbery bit at the end. If it were big enough, you could <em>utilize</em> it as a <em>pogo stick</em>). [Edit: <em>pogo stick</em> also appears in 1409, 1690, 2530]. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 7-7-2006(45): Building on gorgon&#039;s story I now change mine to a much more silly and rememberable one. The Chinese police is using a helicopter to check and regulate the<strong> traffic</strong>. Hanging from the helicopter is a huge <em>chopseal</em> that they <em>utilize</em> to mark some of the cars that are causing trouble on the <em>road</em>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stshores24">stshores24</a>] 3-9-2008(22): <strong>MA</strong> （マ） drinks one too many <em>screwdriver</em>s and then drives off down the <em>road</em>. Unfortunately, she&#039;s so inebriated she causes a<strong> traffic</strong> accident. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jotun">jotun</a>] 1-6-2008(12): They have built a new road downtown. It bypasses all the<strong> traffic</strong>. If your papers have been <em>chop seal</em>ed, you can <em>utilize</em> it. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 20-11-2007(8): Same as Katsuo, but I remember &quot;utilize&quot; better as &quot;philips screw driver&quot;. A long <em>screw driver</em> with a <em>chop-seal</em> on the end makes an interesting <em>pogo stick</em>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/delenir">delenir</a>] 31-8-2009(6): This ROAD has been STAMPED FOR USE (chop-seal, utilize) for<strong> TRAFFIC</strong>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pangolin">Pangolin</a>] 19-2-2009(5): <em>Chop-seal</em> + <em>utilize</em> always looked like a classic car&#039;s hood ornament + radiator grille to me (the makers emblem is a kind of chop-seal, isn&#039;t it?). I call it <em>hood ornament</em> for short. If you imagine all the cars on the road with their gleaming <em>hood ornaments</em> on the <em>road</em> in a gangster movie<strong> traffic</strong> scene... This radical name can work quite well in other kanji containing it. See &#039;jump&#039; and &#039;pain&#039; for which I use related stories. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ellasevia">ellasevia</a>] 24-4-2010(3): The <em>road</em> service <em>utilizes</em> the throwing of <em>mangoes</em> at one&#039;s car as a tool to prevent speeding accidents, which pile up<strong> traffic</strong>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(2): [甬 = <em>road with walls on both sides</em>, also appears in <a href="../1409">jump</a> <span class="index">(#1409 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/踊">踊</a>)</span>, <a href="../1690">pain</a> <span class="index">(#1690 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/痛">痛</a>)</span> and <a href="../2530">bucket</a> <span class="index">(#2530 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/桶">桶</a>)</span>] Story: If you drive onto a <em>road with walls on both sides</em>, it&#039;ll be hard to get off the <em>road</em> and avoid the <strong>traffic</strong>. If you&#039;re lucky, you&#039;ll avoid the <strong>traffic</strong> jam (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/交通渋滞">交通渋滞</a>  ). 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/einahpets">einahpets</a>] 6-2-2012(2): Lots of <em>Ma (マ)s utilize</em> the <em>road</em> to take their kids to school. Sure makes a lot of<strong> traffic</strong>.
