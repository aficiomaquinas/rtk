2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 3-7-2008(153): Because I<strong> worship</strong> her, I only finger ONE BUSH, her&#039;s, and no others!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikedough2">mikedough2</a>] 20-1-2008(72): Imagine a weird cult where you hang a <em>bush from the ceiling</em> and then point at it with one <em>finger</em> saying &quot;<em>Bush</em>, <em>bush</em>, <em>bush</em>, I<strong> worship</strong> the bush!&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSleeve">TheSleeve</a>] 5-11-2007(31): PRESIDENT BUSH thought that coming to power would cause people to<strong> WORSHIP</strong> him, but now that his approval rating is so low, people just give him the FINGER and hang BUSH-pinatas from the CEILING to hit with bats.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 6-3-2007(13): A bush hanging from the ceiling = <em>mistletoe</em>. Mistletoe was<strong> worship</strong>ped by ancient pagans because it&#039;s evergreen and the viscous juice of its white berries resembles human semen. Of course, in kanjiland, they don&#039;t<strong> worship</strong> mistletoe, but mistle<em>finger</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asayoru">Asayoru</a>] 2-11-2010(6): I imagine a weird cult where they suspend virgins from the <em>ceiling</em> to<strong> worship</strong> their <em>bushes</em>… with their <em>fingers</em>.
