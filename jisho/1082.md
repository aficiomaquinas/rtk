## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 27-7-2007(228): I see the story of Hachiko: the faithfull dog who still waited for his master to return long after he had died. Brings a tear to the eye. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 28-3-2007(147): <strong>Tears</strong> are watery (<em>water</em> + <em>re</em>). 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 4-6-2006(35): When my dog (who was about as big as a <em>St. Bernard</em>) got quite old, he had to be put down. The last thing that I saw was him lying on the table staring at me before the vet shut the <em>door</em>. The way he looked at me, I swear he knew that his time was over. Dogs don&#039;t shed<strong> tears</strong> but if he could have I think he would have at that time.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pangolin">Pangolin</a>] 7-1-2009(8): The <em>drops of water</em> are Alice (in Wonderland)&#039;s<strong> tears</strong> of frustration when she grows so <em>big</em> that she can&#039;t get out of the <em>door</em>.
