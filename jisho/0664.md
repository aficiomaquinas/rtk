## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mairov">mairov</a>] 2-9-2007(236): My piggy bank is so heavy that I cannot<strong> HOIST</strong> it using just my fingers.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 12-9-2007(157): Picture a major robbery where some dudes are breaking into a bank to steal their money. They get their man in the vault through the ceiling - now he&#039;s hanging from a rope a few feet from the ground (like in the movies, dodging laser beams). He reports back that he has found the loot, and its all in a large piggy bank in the center of the vault. The alarm sounds and he&#039;s got to think fast. He jams the four fingers of his right hand in the piggy bank slot and tells his team to<strong> hoist</strong> him up, he&#039;s got the loot!
