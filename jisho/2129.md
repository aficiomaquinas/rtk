## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey">onsen_monkey</a>] 14-9-2006(149): Notice how BUGS BUNNY&#039;s legs (hint about stroke extension) are starting to get big MUSCLES? It must be because he&#039;s always EXERTING himself on the run from Elmer Fudd (or from kicking the shit out of Elmer Fudd when he catches up!!).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 8-2-2008(89): Hint: Energizer bunny.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru">raseru</a>] 16-6-2008(38): The energizer bunny&#039;s<strong> exertion</strong> of power keeps going and going...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-4-2007(12): <em>Bugs Bunny</em> spares himself the <strong>exertion</strong> of <em>muscle</em> power. Instead, he <strong>studies</strong> and tricks Fudd every time.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 21-6-2008(10): The <em>trix rabbit&#039;s</em> latest scheme to get the trix: Dress up with fake <em>muscles</em> like a body builder and amaze the kids as he lifts dumbbells. He accidentally uses real dumbbells though, and despite all his<strong> exertion</strong>, the kids discover his disguise. Geez, he really <strong>exerts</strong> himself in all these weird schemes... you&#039;d think it would just be easier to go to the store and buy a box.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 7-5-2006(9): Mr Rabbit goes to extreme<strong> exertion</strong> to make it to the Queens Court now. He eats a whole can of spinnach to be able to break through hedges and fences.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 26-5-2010(6): <em>Jessica Rabbit</em> pulled a <em>muscle</em> in her leg from over<strong> exertion</strong>. She was really going for it !!! ( With all those high kicking dance routines I mean ;).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 27-5-2009(4): In Japan, there are some extreme cases where you really need to <strong>Exert</strong> your apologies over and over.. You&#039;ll of course, need <em>Excuse Power</em>, which all Japanese are naturally born with. (Imagine someone <strong>Exerting</strong> himself with repeated bows and <em>Powerful Excuses</em> &quot; ご免なさい ! <a href="midori://search?text=ご免！ご免！！">ご免！ご免！！</a> &quot;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rowdyphantom">rowdyphantom</a>] 9-2-2010(3): <em>Roger Rabbit</em> is sick of being puny, so he goes and gets himself some barbells, but it&#039;s no use: no matter how much<strong> exertion</strong> he puts into it, his <em>muscles</em> don&#039;t develop.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 24-6-2009(3): For many Americans, apologizing as much as the Japanese do in certain situations requires a lot of emotional<strong> exertion</strong> that that they&#039;re not used to. The Japanese, of course, are used to it - you could say they have developed more <em>excuse power</em> than Americans have (inspired by cerulean).
