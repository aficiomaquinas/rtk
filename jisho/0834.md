## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 31-10-2007(236): A pretty tough kanji. Think of elegant old housewives with English accents dining together at a HOUSE party. The hostess brings out a dish of hors d&#039;oeuvres: a SPIKE of metal with an EYEBALL and a HEART skewered on it. Upon being offered this treat, one of the housewives says in her English accent, &quot;I&#039;d<strong> RATHER</strong> not.&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saranich">saranich</a>] 25-3-2006(235): <strong>Rather</strong> a house with a heart than an eye with a spike.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 8-11-2008(63): Did your parents ever tell you that <em>home</em> is where the <em>heart</em> is? Maybe that&#039;s because they want to keep an <em>eye</em> on you. They&#039;d<strong> rather</strong> you were inside, than on the <em>streets</em>. Sadly, crack doesn&#039;t sell itself.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Samsara">Samsara</a>] 3-9-2008(43): I&#039;d<strong> rather</strong> die peacefully in my <em>house</em> from a <em>heart</em> attack than from a <em>spike</em> in my <em>eye</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 9-3-2006(42): Picture a racist railroad foreman from the days when the wild west was being tamed. &quot;I&#039;d<strong> rather</strong> be at my house eatin&#039; and drinkin&#039; my way to a heart attack than watching these slanty eyed Chinese immigrants hammering railroad spikes&quot;.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep">krungthep</a>] 27-11-2009(33): I&#039;d<strong> rather</strong> stay <em>home</em> with my sweet<em>heart</em> than out <em>eye</em>ing other women in the <em>street</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 24-5-2007(13): Dan <strong>Rather</strong> is resting in his <em>house</em> when CBS thugs break in, rip out his <em>heart</em>, squeeze it over an <em>Eye of Sauron</em> Palantir, and then <em>nail</em> Dan <strong>Rather</strong> with a <em>spike</em>. &quot;Nobody gets out of CBS! Ever!&quot; (Is the CBS Eye logo the <em>Eye of Sauron</em>?).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eccovento">eccovento</a>] 23-1-2007(12): This is the choice. would you<strong> rather</strong> have a house, love, wisdom/the eye, or career/nail of work?

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 14-5-2013(10): Where would you<strong> rather</strong> be on a Friday night? I know <em>home</em> is where the <em>heart</em> is but I&#039;d<strong> rather</strong> be out <em>eye</em>ing pretty girls and trying to <em>nail</em> them. Much<strong> rather</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kakashi">kakashi</a>] 9-8-2011(10): It may be easier to break this up into two images. Light, from Death Note, asks you: &quot;How would you<strong> rather</strong> die? By default, you can die from a heart attack at home, or I can have your eye on a spike. It&#039;s all up to you.&quot;.
