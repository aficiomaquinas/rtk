heisig: "The composition of this kanji shows three elements, which we list in the order of their writing: <i>bound up</i> . . . <i>rice field</i> . . . <i>cooking fire</i>. Not much to work with at first sight. But we can join them together by thinking of a three-part story: first a <b>fish</b> is caught and <i>bound up</i> on a line with its unfortunate school-mates; when the fisherman gets home, he cuts off the head and tosses it, with the entrails, out into the <i>rice fields</i> for fertilizer; and the rest he sets in a skillet over a <i>cooking fire</i> for his supper."
