2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 8-1-2008(58): The ultimate<strong> he</strong>-man is the Neanderthal cave man. His club is as big as a pillar (<em>column</em>), and<strong> he</strong> wears a ragged <em>pelt</em> as his only clothing. To remember the <em>column</em>, imagine the cave man resting the club vertically like a column when not in use.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 1-5-2006(8): <strong>He</strong> has a pelt (&quot;skin of a beast&quot;, the dictionary says!) around his column (&quot;a vertical structure standing alone and not supporting anything&quot;, the dictionary says!).

Because if <em>he</em> wore a <em>pelt</em> from last year&#039;s collection the girls would have nothing to do with him. Not much have change the last 10.000 years.
