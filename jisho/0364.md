## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bigloui">bigloui</a>] 2-2-2006(164): The <em>march</em> of <em>women</em> - against <em>intimidation</em> in the workplace - is pretty <em>intimidating</em> in itself! 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 10-12-2007(64): Interesting that this kanji also has the meanings of &quot;dignity&quot; and &quot;threaten.&quot; I can see how a <em>march</em> of <em>women</em> in Japan would be seen as <em>intimidating</em> by most men. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nekesu04">Nekesu04</a>] 12-11-2008(52): A <em>one woman</em> <em>parade</em>? How is that supposed to<strong> intimidate</strong> me? 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 3-10-2008(27): I use <em>Grim Reaper</em> instead of <em>march</em> for the primitive, because he&#039;s the <em>one</em> holding the <em>scythe</em> (see [360]). Now imagine a female Grim Reaper - that&#039;s even more <strong>intimidating</strong>! 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaeru">kaeru</a>] 31-10-2008(25): A group of feminist WOMEN are MARCHING for their rights, theyre so ugly it&#039;s INTIMIDATING. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 15-4-2007(8): She might look like a <strong>timid</strong> <em>woman</em> but Cindy Sheehan and her group of <em>marching women</em> manage to<strong> intimidate</strong> the president. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/plumage">plumage</a>] 18-5-2009(7): A PARADE of &quot;WOMEN with FLAT TOPS&quot; is pretty <strong>INTIMIDATING</strong>. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 18-3-2008(7): Marches of Feminist women don&#039;t stick with me I&#039;m afraid; but the image of an<strong> INTIMIDATE</strong>D young <em>woman</em>, her hair roughly cut off, being <em>marched</em> , <em>alone</em> through the streets of liberated France in 1945, clutching her innocent half-German baby, does. See <a href="http://www.philosophyblog.com.au/images/shaved-woman.jpg">http://www.philosophyblog.com.au/images/shaved-woman.jpg</a>. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tefhel">Tefhel</a>] 7-7-2010(6): A <em>march</em> of <em>women</em>? Am I supposed to be<strong> intimidate</strong>d?? Pfft. They should get back in the kitchen where they belong. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic">anthropic</a>] 3-5-2009(5): It is VERY <strong>intimidating</strong> to march up to a <a href="../98">woman</a> <span class="index">(#98 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/女">女</a>)</span> you like, especially if she is marching with her feminist friends..
