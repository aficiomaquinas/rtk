## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 13-6-2007(155): I said some bad words, and my mother<strong> chastise</strong>d me by washing my mouth out with glue instead of soap!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 18-3-2007(110): In Colonial New England, people who committed adultery had <em>words</em> <em>glued</em> to them. A famous example is the &quot;A&quot; worn by Hester Prynn for committing adultery (i.e., not being chaste). In this way, <em>words</em> <em>glued</em> to you are supposed to<strong> chastise</strong> you and prevent further breaches of chastity.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NickCooper">NickCooper</a>] 27-7-2008(50): If you<strong> chastise</strong> someone correctly the words will stick like glue.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcbainpc">mcbainpc</a>] 25-6-2008(42): I said some bad <em>words</em> and my mom <em>glue</em>d my mouth shut to<strong> chastise</strong> me.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephjapan2004">stephjapan2004</a>] 17-10-2007(21): Chastising <em>words</em> <em>stick</em> to your mind.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hotsw4p">hotsw4p</a>] 14-1-2010(18): <a href="../v4/336">admonish</a> (#336 警) vs. <a href="../v4/340">chastise</a> (#340 討) vs. <a href="../v4/352">rebuke</a> (#352 諭). admonish is the most kind of the three, being more of a warning or counsel against doing something. rebuke is to criticize harshly or express strong disapproval, so something like PETA.<strong> chastise</strong> is the worst, involving some sort of punishment as well as harsh criticism. my story for<strong> chastise</strong>: &quot;The natives<strong> CHASTISE</strong>D the missionaries for what <em>WAS SAID</em>, <em>GLUING</em> their mouths shut to keep them from spreading any more propaganda&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 13-2-2009(14): This kanji doesn&#039;t mean<strong> chastise</strong>. It means attack or question, so I name it &quot;inquisition&quot;, because they both questioned and attacked people because of their religion during the inquisition: They used words to question you, and then if they thought you were the wrong religion they&#039;d attack you with hot glue.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 29-3-2009(13): When you&#039;re <strong>chastising</strong> someone, <em>measure</em> your <em>words</em> carefully or they might hate you.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mdspencer">mdspencer</a>] 13-5-2009(11): If you wish to<strong> chastise</strong> someone, the <em>words</em> that you use should be carefully <em>measured</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 28-2-2008(8): <em>Words</em> meant to<strong> CHASTISE</strong> should always be carefully <em>measured</em>. (Positioning tweak on dogray&#039;s story).
