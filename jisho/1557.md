## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 16-8-2006(292): When <em>women</em> marry, they adopt the<strong> surname</strong> of their husband, signifiying the start of a new <em>life</em> together. (adapted from gorgon). 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 1-3-2006(87): <em>Woman</em> change their<strong> surname</strong> when they &quot;start their new <em>life</em>&quot;. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko">Nuriko</a>] 16-4-2008(34): To help you keep this separate from <a href="../1828">family name</a> <span class="index">(#1828 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/氏">氏</a>)</span> (as I have been doing lately...), picture a woman who just married a man, and of course, she adopts his<strong> surname</strong> and they start a new life together. Throughout their entire life together, he requires her to address him as &quot;sir.&quot; Yes, like the sur in &quot;surname&quot;. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 6-3-2008(21): <em>Women</em> should keep their own<strong> surname</strong> when they marry. Changing<strong> surname</strong> is like disavowing your previous <em>life</em>. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 3-9-2007(10): The <em>woman</em> didn&#039;t want to marry <em>Frankenstein</em> in the first place, much less have to change her <strong>surname</strong>. (Image: the bride griamcing in the contables office signing the certificate to change her name). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 13-1-2008(8): Although it is the <em>woman</em> that must bear new <em>life</em>, it is generally the man that gets to pass on his<strong> surname</strong>. Seriously, what&#039;s up with that? 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 5-8-2010(6): A trick to keep it separate from &quot;family name&quot;: What<strong> surname</strong>? What&#039;s her name? (Say them fast and they sound similar) The her is the woman who is in this kanji, but NOT in family name. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 27-9-2011(5): The<strong> surname</strong> goes not with the <em>woman</em> but with the sperm <em>cell</em> with the Y chromosome. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 20-10-2008(4): It&#039;s been scientifically proven that when a woman gets married, a special dormant cell in her brain becomes active. It &quot;reprograms&quot; her cognitive activity to respond to a new name. It is thus called the &quot;<strong>surname</strong> <em>cell</em>&quot;, and it&#039;s only found in <em>women</em>. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skribblets">skribblets</a>] 2-9-2010(3): Tinkerbell things it&#039;s bull crap that she has to change her<strong> surname</strong> for marraige just because she&#039;s a woman!
