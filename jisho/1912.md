## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 16-6-2007(228): The yakuza boss reclines in the oaken bathtub wearing his shades while his personal harem<strong> dance</strong>s nakes for him.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 15-6-2008(120): I learned <a href="../v4/1775">nothingness</a> (#1775 無) first because it is a very common kanji. Probably easier to think of this kanji in that context. Attractive<strong> dance</strong>rs should<strong> dance</strong> wearing <strong>nothing</strong> but <strong>sunglasses</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 3-6-2007(18): I imagine this <em>big oaken tub</em> as being full of grapes being squashed by the feet of the vinyard owners. Each wearing <em>sunglasses</em> and doing that Russian arms crossed <em>dance</em> and squishing all the grapes.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spleenlol">spleenlol</a>] 8-6-2010(14): See <a href="../v4/1409">jump</a> (#1409 踊). Renamed this kanji <strong>interpretive<strong> dance</strong></strong>. (readapated thegeezer3) The yakuza boss reclines in the oaken bathtub wearing his タキ(tacky) <em>sunglasses</em> while his personal harem does an <strong>interpretive<strong> dance</strong></strong> for him.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 12-5-2012(13): Heisig, let&#039;s get this straight: NEW keywords: 曜 JUMP ex-<a href="../v4/1285">leap</a> (#1285 躍); 踊 <strong> DANCE</strong>=ODORI ex-<a href="../v4/1409">jump</a> (#1409 踊); 舞 KABUKI ex-<a href="../v4/1774">dance</a> (#1774 舞) (used in concepts related to<strong> dance</strong>, like stages, fluttering, etc.). So, KABUKI 歌舞伎 【かぶき】is the keyword here. STORY: We learn <a href="../v4/1775">nothingness</a> (#1775 無) first because it is a very common kanji. Then we go to see KABUKI en the EVENING wearing SUNGLASSES.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 26-11-2007(11): This is the original concept for the video for &quot;Everybody<strong> Dance</strong> Now&quot;. A bikini clad beauty (or hunk) <em>reclining</em> in an <em>oaken tub</em>, soaping herself up something obscene. Then from the bottom of the screen emerges the MC, sporting a pair of <em>stunna shades</em> and shouting &quot;Everybody<strong> dance</strong> now!&quot;.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shinyuryu">Shinyuryu</a>] 15-6-2010(4): Id rather recline on a bed of nails, than<strong> dance</strong> with those stupid sunglasses.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 16-6-2009(4): When I see this keyword, I think of the Lady GaGa song &quot;Just <strong>Dance</strong>.&quot; Of course, knowing Lady Gaga, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if she<strong> dance</strong>d in <em>nothing</em> but <em>sunglasses</em> (going off of the next kanji <a href="../v4/1775">nothingness</a> (#1775 無) - thanks captal).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gluaygluay">gluaygluay</a>] 4-10-2012(3): (slight mod to thegeezer3&#039;s story): The yakuza boss reclines in the oaken ofuro, with Psy wearing his shades leaning his head on his shoulder, while the skinny tattooed guy<strong> dance</strong>s in front of them Gangnam style! <a href="http://youtu.be/9bZkp7q19f0?t=47s">http://youtu.be/9bZkp7q19f0?t=47s</a> for visualization.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mary_K">Mary_K</a>] 24-7-2009(2): <strong>Dance</strong>,<strong> dance</strong>,<strong> dance</strong>. Whether I&#039;m in a <em>tub</em> or wearing <em>sunglasses</em>, all I want to do is<strong> dance</strong>.
