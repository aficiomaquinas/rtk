1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 4-1-2007(165): This character refers to feudal<strong> clan</strong>s that were abolished in 1871 (Meiji 4) in favor of prefectures (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/廃藩置県">廃藩置県</a>  ), and thus were predecessors of the modern prefectures. As we know from   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/落">落</a>  , flowers and water drops each have their own way of falling. This character says that<strong> clan</strong>s&#039; location was decided in the way flowers, water drops and dice fall: at random.

Each year the shogun would roll <em>dice</em> to determine which<strong> clan</strong> had the honour of providing him with nori that year.
