## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 11-10-2005(210): A huge index <em>finger</em> coming down from the sky is kicking boulders of <em>rock</em>,<strong> clear</strong>ing the land. Maybe it&#039;s the <em>finger</em> of God preparing a place for his little people to live. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nakome">nakome</a>] 1-3-2008(89): I imagine <strong>clear</strong>ing <strong>the land</strong> in order to set up your tent after a long day of backpacking. Using your <em>fingers</em>, you pick up all of the <em>rocks</em> and get them out of the way so that you can get a comfortable night sleep. If you don&#039;t <strong>clear the land</strong> you can just picture the rock sticking into your back as you toss and turn all night long. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois">Francois</a>] 17-4-2008(58): To<strong> clear</strong> the land, farmers use their fingers to get the stones out. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun">sutebun</a>] 18-10-2007(23): <strong>Clear</strong> the land reminds me of that game Harvest Moon and all those stones in the farm he had to pick up with his bare fingers to make room for crops. Until you get the might of the dwarves gloves to enhance your fingers grip ability (last explanation is to distinguish this from polish). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/undead_saif">undead_saif</a>] 10-6-2009(15): Easy one, Palestinian children keep trying to<strong> clear</strong> (the land) from hostile Israelis by throwing STONES on them with their FINGERS. (<a href="http://www.axisoflogic.com/artman/uploads/faris-odeh2.jpg">http://www.axisoflogic.com/artman/uploads/faris-odeh2.jpg</a>). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy">howdycowdy</a>] 29-3-2008(8): Imagine<strong> CLEAR</strong>ING THE LAND by bringing in a giant who can flick away <em>stones</em> and boulders with his enormous <em>fingers</em>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inaka_rob">inaka_rob</a>] 17-4-2012(7): I decided to<strong> CLEAR</strong> the land the slow way. Flicking all the little STONES away with my FINGER(s). 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abbott">abbott</a>] 9-6-2008(7): Truemmerfrauen (rubble women) <strong>cleared the land</strong> of debrises (<em>stones</em>) in inner cities of Germany and Austria with their bare <em>fingers</em> during WWII. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lazerbeat">Lazerbeat</a>] 23-7-2011(6): In Sim City I<strong> clear</strong> the land using my mouse FINGER to move ROCKS. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/luckashb">luckashb</a>] 23-5-2011(5): In order to<strong> clear</strong> the land you must use your <em>fingers</em> to remove the <em>stones</em>.
