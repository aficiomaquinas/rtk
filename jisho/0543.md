By the end he was walking <em>tall</em> and he basically <em>crowned</em> himself king of the farm...he forgot his roots, that he came from a lowly <em>sow</em>..

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tuuli">tuuli</a>] 10-12-2007(17): Think of King Kong<strong> overpowering</strong> the <em>tall</em> buildings, only now it is a huge <em>sow</em> wearing a <em>crown</em> as she knocks over buildings with her pig hoofs.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rizzo">rizzo</a>] 31-10-2005(10): Miss Piggy (my favourite<strong> overpowering</strong> <em>sow</em>) comes back, wearing a <em>crown</em> this time she&#039;s<strong> overpowering</strong> poor Kermit. Which is easy for her because she&#039;s so <em>tall</em> compared to him.
