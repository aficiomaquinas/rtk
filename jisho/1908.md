## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-4-2007(172): Mrs. Badger follows the <em>animal tracks</em> to the den where she finds her husband getting a <em>blowjob</em> from a fox. &quot;I have a good <strong>explanation</strong> for this. Really!&quot;. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 14-10-2009(103): <strong>Animal track</strong> primitive: As expected, <strong>animal tracks</strong> were left in place of the trail of <em>rice</em> I&#039;d purposely <em>drop</em>ped the night before. EDIT - also try <strong>the footprint</strong> for a primitive meaning, the classic symbol of detective films. STORY: This <em>shakuhachi</em> player is so talented, he can do<strong> interpretation</strong>s of animal noises too. They&#039;re so realistic he soon has <em>animal tracks</em> leading straight to wherever he&#039;s playing. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 4-1-2007(65): The magical shakuhachi can easily give explanation for any animal tracks, just like it can be used to translate words (  <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/訳">訳</a>  ). 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 22-6-2008(40): Mrs. Badger follows the <em>animal tracks</em> to the den where she finds her husband getting <em>shakuhachi</em> from a fox. Now, I don&#039;t speak badger but judging from the screeching and the gestures, my<strong> interpretation</strong> of the situation is that Mrs. Badger is not pleased. (thanks dingomick! Just trying to use this new keyword). 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/furrykef">furrykef</a>] 5-7-2008(17): An <strong>interpretive</strong> dance of some kind where somebody follows <em>animal tracks</em>, a <em>shakuhachi</em> providing the soundtrack, suggesting the tracker&#039;s thoughts and intentions. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Terhorst">Terhorst</a>] 14-12-2007(17): The <em>animal tracks</em> lead up to the <em>shakuhachi</em>, then disappear without <strong>explanation</strong>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimitha">jimitha</a>] 3-11-2009(15): Because several other stories can involve footprints (<a href="../1286">tread</a> <span class="index">(#1286 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/践">践</a>)</span>, <a href="../1746">tracks</a> <span class="index">(#1746 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/跡">跡</a>)</span>, <a href="../370">stop</a> <span class="index">(#370 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/止">止</a>)</span>, <a href="../374">agreement</a> <span class="index">(#374 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/肯">肯</a>)</span>, etc.) I prefer to use <em>animal droppings</em> here--two <em>drops</em> among the <em>wheat</em>, or one <em>drop</em> among the <em>rice</em>. Story: Archeologists at a dig site discover fossilized <em>animal droppings</em> with a <em>shakuhachi</em> flute embedded inside. They puzzle over the <strong>explanation</strong>. One expert&#039;s <strong>interpretation</strong> is that the whistling attracted a hungry animal to the village, who promptly devoured the player and flute in one gulp. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 13-1-2010(9): <em>Animal tracks</em> were always seen nearby after she had been playing the <em>shakuhachi</em>. The <strong>explanation/interpretation</strong> was that they liked her music. HINT: Animal tracks primitive - On returning to your <em>rice</em> box, you find only one grain (<em>drop</em>) left and animal tracks leading away from the &quot;crime&quot; scene. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 7-12-2009(8): A careful<strong> interpretation</strong> of the animal tracks allowed us to identify what creature stole the shakuhachi. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 18-3-2009(8): I didn&#039;t understand the rice/wheat distinction very well, so I asked the translator   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/訳">訳</a>   to give me an<strong> interpretation</strong>.
