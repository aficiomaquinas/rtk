heisig: "&quot;<b>Many</b> <i>moons</i> ago,&quot; begins much of Amerindian folklore - a colorful way of saying &quot;Once upon a time&quot; and a great deal of help for remembering this kanji. Here we have two <i>moons</i>&nbsp;(three of them would take us back to the beginning of time, which is further than we want to go), lacking the final stroke because they are partially hidden behind the clouds of time."

The moons are overlapping and slightly concealed by a cloud hence the lack of one stroke in each.
