## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 7-3-2007(331): You only truly<strong> forget</strong> her when she has <em>perish</em>ed in your <em>heart</em>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alantin">alantin</a>] 1-11-2007(47): To<strong> forget</strong> means that something perishes from your heart. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 15-10-2007(31): <em>Perish</em> my <em>heart</em> if I<strong> forget</strong> this kanji. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penot">penot</a>] 12-9-2008(23): A <em>dead heart</em> is the only way to <strong>forget</strong> your love. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zer0range">zer0range</a>] 28-3-2009(18): We keep the deceased in our hearts so as not to<strong> forget</strong>. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/norton">norton</a>] 8-1-2013(13): I didn&#039;t do well as a doctor. One of my patients <em>perished</em> because I <strong>forgot</strong> to put her <em>heart</em> back at the end of the surgery. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 27-4-2006(10): You will perish if you<strong> forget</strong> to make your heart beat. (Never mind that it&#039;s an involuntary muscle) The reason people die of old age is simply dementia. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meredithcat">meredithcat</a>] 4-4-2010(7): Your Japanese teacher&#039;s <em>heart</em> <em>dies</em> a little bit when you<strong> forget</strong> a kanji. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tsenita">tsenita</a>] 21-7-2009(5): You only truly<strong> forget</strong> her when she has <em>perish</em>ed from your <em>heart</em>. Think also of the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind... Joel tries to erase Clementine from his mind, but he can&#039;t erase her (or make her <em>perish</em>) from his <em>heart</em>, so he can&#039;t <strong>forget</strong> her. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 17-5-2013(4): <strong>Forget</strong> them not. Let those that <em>perished</em> today live on deep DOWN in your <em>heart</em>. Never<strong> forget</strong>.
