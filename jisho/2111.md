## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 20-7-2007(56): On the <em>first day of the month</em>, all the salmon<strong> go upstream</strong>, up the <em>road</em>, to the mating grounds.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paasan">paasan</a>] 29-7-2010(22): You accidentally ran over and killed the holy <em>mountain goat</em> on the <em>road</em>. Frightened by the view of the dead <em>body</em> and to save your own <em>body</em> from the angry villagers, you decide to run away from your bloodstained vehicle, jump into the river, and <strong>go upstream</strong> to hide your tracks.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/manubear">manubear</a>] 10-8-2012(7): You decide to go salmon fishing, so you ride a <em>mountain goat</em> to the top of the <em>road</em>. Under the light of the <em>moon</em>, as it&#039;s illegal, you catch the salmon <strong>going upstream</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Puchatek">Puchatek</a>] 12-8-2011(5): In this kanji we see a <em>mountain goat</em> that decided to<strong> go upstream</strong> along a <em>road</em>, but for some reason it will only<strong> go upstream</strong> when the full <em>moon</em> is up. It&#039;s actually stubborn like a <em>mountain goat</em> about not going upstream along the <em>road</em> at any other period of time. The <em>road</em> itself is also very confused about this.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-7-2009(5): On the <em>first day of the month</em> the <em>road</em> to<strong> go upstream</strong> is opened for salmon fisherman.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Machine_Gun_Cat">Machine_Gun_Cat</a>] 27-8-2009(3): <em>Weregoat</em> proceeds to<strong> go upstream</strong> of the traffic smashing cars and trucks of the <em>road</em> with his twisting horns.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/EKeiko">EKeiko</a>] 21-1-2013(2): On the <a href="../v4/2846">first day of the month</a> (#2846 朔), the river flooded over the ROAD... All the poor salmon had to<strong> GO UPSTREAM</strong> by crossing the ROAD. (To make matters worse, this MOUNTAIN GOAT came and ate their FLESH while they tried to cross the ROAD. Many of them were never able to<strong> GO UPSTREAM</strong>.).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 7-7-2012(1): On the <em>first day of the month</em>, all the salmon, to the last <em>drop</em>,<strong> go upstream</strong>, up the <em>road</em>, to their mating grounds. (a slight fix to Megaqwerty&#039;s story to capture that last drop).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 26-11-2010(1): 遡る =溯る, 遡及 =溯及, 遡求 , <a href="../v4/2847">go upstream</a> (#2847 遡) ソ, さかのぼる ... Parts: 朔 , 辶 (cf: 塑 <a href="../v4/1960">model</a> (#1960 塑), 朔 <a href="../v4/2846">first day of the month</a> (#2846 朔)） ... Story: The <em>Model</em> for fishes <strong>Going Upstream</strong> is a metaphorical <em>Road</em>, it is <em>not Dirt</em>. The Upstream migration, though runs pm a tight schedule. They always leave on the <em>first of the month</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bej001">bej001</a>] 17-12-2012(): On a MOON lit night your walking along on the ROAD when suddenly a possessed MOUNTAIN GOAT comes at you. You jump in the river and<strong> go upstream</strong> so it can&#039;t follow you.
