## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 25-12-2007(188): I <strong>miss</strong> my parents dearly. Here they lay, under a big <em>cross</em>, their <em>mouths</em> side by side. I stick <em>hairpins</em> in their graves. CAREFUL: the stroke order/primitive order is: ten, L mouth, R mouth, hairpin. &quot;Soil&quot; is not drawn in its stroke order. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tristanthorn">tristanthorn</a>] 18-3-2009(104): <em>Ten</em> days ago, our <em>two mouths</em> met for the last time... then she gave me her <em>hairpin</em> as a sayounara gift. How I<strong> miss</strong> my Geisha girl... 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laxxy">laxxy</a>] 30-10-2006(76): This kanji means<strong> miss</strong> as in &quot;miss a (dearly departed) person&quot;, not as in &quot;miss a target&quot;.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Here the dearly departed has been buried in the ground, with her favourite hairpin in place of a gravestone, and two mourners stand around crying with open mouths. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 6-1-2006(15): The miner<strong> miss</strong>es his<strong> miss</strong> (his sweetheart). So much <em>soil</em> is separating his <em>mouth</em> from hers (working as a miner deep below the ground). She left him a <em>hairpin</em> as a good-luck trinket. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BooBooQ88">BooBooQ88</a>] 15-12-2009(12): We tried to kiss ten times but our 2 mouths<strong> MISS</strong>ED every time. She got upset and threw her hairpin at me. 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 30-4-2010(8): When my parents were alive, their talking drove me nuts, so I closed their <em>mouths</em> with a <em>needle</em> and a <em>hairpin</em>. Now, though, I<strong> miss</strong> them terribly. (NOT A TRUE STORY). 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/HolyKotor">HolyKotor</a>] 9-10-2012(7): I <strong>miss</strong> my Japanese girlfriend. The last time I saw her our <em>two mouths</em> kissed under a <em>cross</em> then she gave me her favorite <em>hairpin</em> before saying さようなら。。。. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 22-5-2006(6): You head off to college and decide to join a fraternity. Before you can enter, there’s an initiation rite you must get through. As part of it, you are blindfolded and forced to eat strange things, like TWO MOUTHfuls of DIRT. Then you have to dress like a woman and walk around campus with a HAIRPIN. Lastly, you have to shout into a loudspeaker, “I<strong> MISS</strong> my Mommy.” And actually you might after all that. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 26-1-2008(4): I<strong> miss</strong> the days when I could drink <em>10</em> pints of beer and dress like a slut. Now I have <em>2 mouths</em> to feed, the most fun I can have on a night out is a tomato juice and a plain <em>hair clip</em> to wear. 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 6-5-2013(3): &quot;I<strong> miss</strong> you. I<strong> miss</strong> you. I<strong> miss</strong> you...&quot; Just that, written <em>ten</em> times followed by two kisses from her <em>mouth</em>... wait... what&#039;s this? A <em>hairpin</em> with a clump of hair, too short to be from her head... Eugh! I don&#039;t<strong> miss</strong> you at all crazy stalker lady - I hope they throw away the key!
