heisig: "The <i>house</i> of <i>flowers</i> or &quot;hothouse&quot; has become a metaphor for a narrow-minded, biased, and intolerant attitude distrustful of change. <b>Tolerance</b>, in contrast, is open-minded and welcomes novelty. The way to encourage <b>tolerance</b> in those who lack it is first to have them <i>see</i> through their own hothouse attitudes, which is the very counsel we are given in this kanji."

## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 31-7-2007(343): A<strong> tolerant</strong> person will ignore SEEing GRASS (marijuana) in the HOUSE of a friend.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saruwatari">saruwatari</a>] 30-12-2007(178): To be<strong> tolerant</strong> is to see flowers (meaning &quot;beautiful things&quot;) in every house, instead of looking for drawbacks.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen">Ningen</a>] 3-9-2008(82): Kanji Zen: <em>See</em> the <em>flowers</em> in the <em>house</em>. <em>See</em> the good in people. Be<strong> TOLERANT</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Foddy">Foddy</a>] 12-11-2007(82): My wife grows flowers in the house and I see them every day. I don&#039;t really like them, but I have to be<strong> tolerant</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/axelb">axelb</a>] 21-7-2008(23): Into my <em>house</em> someone brought a monstrous <em>flower</em> with a big, <em>walking eye</em>, <em>see</em>ing everything, like a spy. But I am trying to be<strong> tolerant</strong>, although it is getting on my nerves. Remember: The <em>flower</em> is IN the <em>house</em> (that is, underneath its roof-sign).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kreios">kreios</a>] 30-4-2009(16): Is there anything more <strong>tolerant</strong> than a hippie? Those <em>flower</em> children living together in a communal <em>house</em> have a unique way to <em>see</em> the world.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD">PeterJD</a>] 9-4-2008(12): People who keep <em>flowers</em> in their homes (lit. under their <em>roofs</em>) tend to <em>see</em> the world in a more<strong> tolerant</strong> [also lenient, generous and magnanimous] manner (because the flowers keep them from getting too cranky).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 18-10-2007(10): A<strong> tolerant</strong> person will ignore <em>see</em>ing <em>grass</em> in the <em>house</em> of a friend. Note: The house radical goes on top, not grass. Remember that you see the grass INSIDE the house. (Christine Tham&#039;s story, just adding the note in case it helps others).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torokun">torokun</a>] 23-11-2009(5): The most<strong> tolerant</strong> people are hippies, who live in communal <em>houses</em> smoking <em>grass</em> and <em>seeing</em> hallucinations from the acid.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 17-2-2009(5): When you look out of your house through flowery (rose) glasses it is easy to feel<strong> tolerant</strong>.
