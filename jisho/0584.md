## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 7-6-2010(425): <strong>Matrimony</strong> is the state in which the <em>woman</em> has got you <em>pent</em> <em>in</em> like a <em>dog</em> so that you cannot go after other bitches.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eightyd">eightyd</a>] 9-6-2010(74): Forget the heisig stuff for this one. To me it looks like a fat girl looking in a mirror and her reflection is skinny, this is how every fat girl should feel on her day of<strong> matrimony</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 16-4-2007(60): When the <em>woman</em> gets angry, she treats her man like a <em>pent in dog</em> (i.e., puts him in the doghouse). It&#039;s a perfect metaphor for the state of<strong> matrimony</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 23-12-2007(50): <strong>Matrimony</strong> is a <em>cause</em> of <em>women&#039;s</em> suffering.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 7-9-2009(44): 婿嫁婚姻 : Four kanji related to marriage, all with the <em>woman</em> primitive. <strong>Bridegroom</strong>: for the honeymoon, he takes her to the <em>zoo</em> for a <em>month</em>. <strong>Marry into</strong>: since the J-husband is never home, she feels more like she&#039;s married into the <em>house</em> than into a relationship. <strong>Marriage</strong>: is when she gets a new <em>family name</em> on one particular <em>day</em>. <strong>Matrimony</strong>: is the state after the marriage, where she has the husband <em>pent in</em> like a <em>big</em> St. Bernard.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 2-6-2009(23): <em>Women cause</em><strong> matrimony</strong>.
