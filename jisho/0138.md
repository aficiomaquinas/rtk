heisig: "The appearance of the primitive for <i>water</i> in its full form tells us that we have something to do with <i>water</i> here. The extra <i>drop</i> to the left, added as a second stroke, changes the picture from a splash caused by a <i>walking stick</i> dropped into <i>water</i> to form an <b>icicle</b>. If it helps, when you hold an <b>icicle</b> up to the light, you can usually see little crystallizations of five-pointed stars inside of it, which is the shape we have in this kanji."

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe">stereovibe</a>] 27-2-2008(73): <em>A drop</em> in temperature turns <em>water</em> into an<strong> icicle</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ameyama">Ameyama</a>] 22-2-2008(15): Ooooh (う） Look at the drops of water from that<strong> icicle</strong>. (Hiragana う looks like the left side).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/haole">haole</a>] 27-10-2009(8): Just as you dot the &quot;i&quot; in<strong> icicle</strong>, so should you dot the water!
