But in the ancient houses that are placed at the <em>boulevard</em> the<strong> girder</strong>s will be made out of <em>wood</em>. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aniseed">aniseed</a>] 7-3-2010(12): 「けた」。This kanji is used to denote a number of digits or decimal places, e.g.   <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/三桁のパスワード">三桁のパスワード</a>   (a 3-digit password).
