6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hoticehunter">Hoticehunter</a>] 1-4-2012(7): If the keyword is supposed to stand for invigorating, why not just make that the keyword? Heisig doesn&#039;t use invigorating, or any variation of invigorate as a keyword, and<strong> bracing</strong> is almost never used to mean invigorating.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mirnkaya">mirnkaya</a>] 26-5-2012(6): (Thanks CasualTatsumaki) <em>one</em> slap of this aftershave on the <em>four stitches</em> you have on your <em>person</em>. That&#039;s<strong> BRACING</strong>/INVIGORATING.... (note: this story follows the right stroke order as well as the actual parts used here which includes one and person).

A yellow one, a red one, a blue one and a green one. There is this one part of the game where they have to work together and carry sleeping St. Bernard through the garden. Look as the 4 wolverines work together,<strong> bracing</strong> the dog to complete the level.
