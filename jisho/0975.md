In other words, it is the part which feeds us. Hence -- &quot;the<strong> ear</strong> (of a plant) is the <em>favor</em> of the <em>wheat</em>&quot;.

One day, the people begged the wheat plant for a favor to make their lives easier. &quot;It&#039;s too difficult to turn wheat into bread,&quot; they said. They wanted a fast-food making plant. Behold! The plant produced an<strong> ear</strong> of corn! Perfect for making popcorn! Much easier than bread! And so,<strong> ear</strong>s of corn are a favor from the wheat plant. That is how corn plants came into existence. This is also why the tassel on top of a corn plant looks kinda like wheat.
