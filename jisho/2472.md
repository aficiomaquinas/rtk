## Koohii stories:

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 3-8-2008(103): The guy who was thrown into the river to sink was given one last request. &quot;If I&#039;m gonna be sleeping with the fishes,&quot; he said, &quot;can I at least have a<strong> pillow</strong>? I&#039;m real sensitive.&quot; The mafia bosses laughed. &quot;Look, my doctor said I can only use <em>wooden</em><strong> pillow</strong>s, I have a real serious condition. Can I at least die comfortable-like?&quot; The mafia dudes said fine, and let him have his<strong> pillow</strong>. They tossed him the river and drove off...and after a minute, he bobbed to the top, thanks to his floating <em>wood</em><strong> pillow</strong>. 

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 28-6-2010(38): WOODEN<strong> PILLOW</strong>S do not <a href="../1888">sink</a> <span class="index">(#1888 <a href="http://jisho.org/kanji/details/沈">沈</a>)</span> in water. 

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Corodon">Corodon</a>] 11-8-2009(20): (Mature audiences only) As my <em>wood</em> began to <em>sink</em> into her, she moaned into the <strong>pillow</strong>, not wanting to awaken the neighbors with screams of ecstasy. 

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 16-12-2009(7): Some Japanese people sleep with a<strong> pillow</strong> made of <em>wood</em>, in case there&#039;s a flood in the middle of the night. Because <strong>pillows</strong> made of <em>wood</em> do not <em>sink</em>, they need never fear falling asleep without a flotation device nearby. 

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch">NeoGlitch</a>] 15-11-2010(4): (Mature audiences only) As my <em>wood</em> began to <em>sink</em> into her, she moaned into the <strong>pillow</strong>, not wanting to awaken the neighbors with screams of... pain. It was her first time, and <strong>she wasn&#039;t wet!!</strong> (Thanks Corodon). 

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(4): A <em>roll of paper towels</em> (like a <em>wooden</em> <em>towel rack</em>) might make a decent<strong> pillow</strong>. 

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 3-2-2009(3): Think of the witch trial scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail: &quot;Why do we burn witches? Cause they&#039;re made of WOOD. What do we tie rocks around witches? So that they SINK, cause WOOD doesn&#039;t SINK. Ah, but what also doesn&#039;t sink? A Duck! And what do we use duck feathers to make? A<strong> PILLOW</strong>! Ergo? If she weighs as much as<strong> PILLOW</strong>, then she&#039;ll not SINK like a TREE? And therefore? A witch! Burn Her. 

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 29-12-2008(3): The guy with the <em>crown tied around his leg</em> is a dethroned king, kept in a cell with only a <em>wooden</em><strong> pillow</strong> to sleep with. 

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shidosuru">shidosuru</a>] 5-2-2012(2): The yakuza were nice enough to provide the maimed waitress with a wooden<strong> pillow</strong> nailed to the back of her neck. (remember she&#039;s headless). 

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spot53">Spot53</a>] 12-8-2011(2): (For Mature Audiences) A naked teen is admiring his <em>tree</em> that is <em>crowning</em> his <em>legs</em> in the mirror...then his mom knocks and he grabs a<strong> PILLOW</strong>.
