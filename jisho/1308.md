1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wingedge">wingedge</a>] 22-12-2007(207): &quot;Sunglasses-missing-one-lens&quot; is obviously the <em>monocle</em>. The proper, high-class way to<strong> descend</strong> <em>The Pinnacle</em> is wearing a <em>monocle</em> with your <em>walking legs</em> splayed to a full gentlemanly stride.

The <strong>DESCENT</strong> from the <em>PINNACLE</em> is both the most difficult and most exhilarating part of the walking race. The contestants<strong> DESCEND</strong> from the <em>PINNACLE</em>, their <em>WALKING LEGS</em> moving as fast as they can. The <em>WI</em>nner crosses the line screaming I &quot;<em>W-I-I-I-I-I-I-I</em>-n!&quot;.
