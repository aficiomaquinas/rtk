    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>Let <b>bowl</b> suggest a large and heavy <i>golden</i> <b>bowl</b> into which you are throwing all the <i>books</i> you own to mash them into pulp, for some outrageous reason you will have to think up yourself.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 17-6-2008(202): This is the<strong> BOWL</strong> of an alchemist: see how he mixes <em>metals</em> in his<strong> bowl</strong>, as he follows the instructions from his <em>book</em>?</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sannomiya">sannomiya</a>] 20-11-2006(66): If I was begging with a<strong> BOWL</strong>, I would want GOLD and BOOKS.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63">ashman63</a>] 31-3-2008(27): I actually picture a <em>book</em> made of <em>gold</em> that's been warped (due to the malleability of gold) so that it has a dent in the middle that can be used as a<strong> bowl</strong>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 13-8-2007(23): This is a great way to learn a lot of knowledge in a little bit of time. You get a <em>metal</em><strong> bowl</strong> and throw in as many <em>books</em> as you can! Keep'em coming! Once you have every book you can think of that you have read or want to read in that<strong> bowl</strong> grind'em all up!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/applesuki">applesuki</a>] 13-12-2006(21): The winners of the super<strong> bowl</strong> get <em>gold</em> rings, while the losers just get a mention in the record <em>book</em>.</p>
