    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>The key word, <b>parts of speech</b>, refers to nouns, verbs, adjective, adverbs, and so on. The elements: <i>words</i> . . . <i>directors</i>.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 26-4-2007(206): The big mouthed <em>diretor</em> is even picky about the <strong>parts of speech</strong> you use, shouting, "More verbs! Less adjectives!" and such all the time.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 4-12-2006(49): A Grammar is basically a <em>word director</em> that tells us what part of speech each word is.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fergal">fergal</a>] 11-10-2009(24): This kanji is the ending of lots of<strong> parts of speech</strong> like noun, verb, adverb: 名詞 , 動詞 , 動詞 . People are messing around with <strong>parts of speech</strong> all the time now. <em>Company directors</em> are the worst, making up new <em>words</em> by verbing nouns and nouning verbs. "please action that", "what is the take-home from that?".</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 19-7-2009(9): This <em>director</em> speaks very fast. So fast that you can understand only <strong>parts of</strong> his <strong>speech</strong> (some of the <em>words</em>). To make it even more memorable, imagine that this <em>director</em> speaks in Japanese and you are his interpreter. All you can understand at your current level is only<strong> parts of speech</strong>. You think to yourself: "Probably this word was a noun and that word was a verb, but what the hell is he speaking about?".</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 4-1-2008(9): A lot of the keywords in this book are a little difficult to figure out because you don't know the actual part of speech. Imagine a new edition with a friendly, chubby little <em>Alfred Hitchcock</em> holding a sign up telling you exactly which part of speech each word is.</p>
