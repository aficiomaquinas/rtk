    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>Did you ever hear of the <i>turtle</i> who fell madly in love with a <i>chihuahua</i> but could not have her because their two families did not like the idea of their children intermarrying? Like all classic stories of ill-fated love, this one shows how the young upset the <b>status quo</b> with an emotion older and more powerful than anything their elders have devised to counter it: blind love.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 31-7-2007(161): It was <em>left</em> to the <strong>turtle</strong> to make <em>right</em> with the <strong>dog</strong> and thus maintain the <strong>status quo.</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 13-12-2006(91): A <em>turtle</em> mounting a <em>chihuahua</em> clearly disrupts the<strong> status quo</strong>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 4-12-2007(43): After beating the hare in a race, the <em>turtle</em> is now acknowledged to be the fastest animal. But the chihuahua is challenging the<strong> status quo</strong>, demanding a new race. And look - the dog is on the right, meaning he's passed the turtle! Hope he doesn't take a nap.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 18-12-2007(35): If you gave the sense "a person's back" to the primitive in <a href="../v4/235.html">portent</a> (#235 兆), you can see that a <em>dog</em>, wanting to preserve its<strong> status quo</strong> among its pals, tries to bite the <em>back</em> of a poor postman.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly">uchifly</a>] 27-1-2009(28): The<strong> STATUS QUO</strong> was broken when the TURTLE and the DOG got married! You should have see the offspring… Dogs with shells on!!</p>
