<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(399): This is either a love scene or a murder scene that you are seeing through a<strong> window</strong>. The love scene: through the<strong> window</strong> of a house (from a distance), you see a pair of human legs, then elbows, and then some pink hearts floating up like in a cartoon. The murder scene: peering through the<strong> window</strong> of a house, you see a gruesome murder scene. Human legs dangling from a ceiling fan, an elbow sticking out of a wall, and a heart still beating on the carpet.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 21-6-2006(81): A photographer is at <em>home</em>, recovering his broken <em>human legs</em>. With nothing better to do, he is looking through the rear <strong>window</strong> with his camera (he needs to use his <em>elbow</em> to support those heavy lenses) until his <em>heart</em> begins to race as he witnesses a murder!</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 18-2-2007(67): A voyeur peeks in the<strong> window</strong> of a <em>house</em>, but all he can see is <em>legs</em>. So he <em>elbows</em> up into the<strong> window</strong> for a better view which gets his <em>heart</em> racing.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois">Francois</a>] 21-4-2008(52): When I see that<strong> window</strong> I get chills… I was in that house when my girlfriend threw me out the<strong> window</strong>. She broke my <em>legs, my elbows and my heart</em>!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/karmatheif">karmatheif</a>] 8-7-2008(33): The top primitive is similar to <a href="../v4/1316.html">hole</a> (#1316 穴). A<strong> window</strong> is a <a href="../v4/1316.html">hole</a> (#1316 穴) in your house that you occassionally sit next to while leaning on your ELBOW and gazing out, a picture of a lonely HEARTedness.</p>
