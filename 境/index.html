    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>Imagine the <b>boundary</b> of a plot of <i>land</i> marked with gigantic <i>mirrors</i> enabling the landowner to keep trespassers in sight at all times.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nyquil">nyquil</a>] 13-3-2007(195): In the dense cities of Japan even a small garden is a luxury. In this house, the owner has put <em>mirrors</em> on the<strong> boundary</strong> of his <em>land</em> so it feels much bigger.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brose">brose</a>] 16-12-2006(108): This is an old trick to keep out migrants. You put a bunch of dirty mirrors on the<strong> boundary</strong> of your land and theirs. When they approach the<strong> boundary</strong>, what they see in the mirror is their own land and someone that looks like themselves, only dirtier, so they figure your country isn't any better than their own and they head back home.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 25-1-2008(33): <strong>Boundaries</strong> and borders (another meaning of this kanji) used to be protected by daggers and swords (see <strong>environs</strong>, frame 284); but today our <em>lands</em> are protected by one-way <em>mirrors</em> at airport customs with video cameras and interrogation rooms behind them.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tstuhldreher">tstuhldreher</a>] 6-6-2008(20): In Japan, you often see MIRRORS at intersections. That's because the walls that form the<strong> boundary</strong> of people's LAND make it hard to see around corners.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rujiel">Rujiel</a>] 30-7-2009(19): Be aware the right-hand character 竟 really means "endpoint" or "finally"; it's commonly read "つい" (as in "ついに") and usually written in kana alone. A<strong> boundary</strong> represents a country's <em>land</em>'s <em>endpoint</em> (awkward phrasing for order) .</p>
