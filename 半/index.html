    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>Although the writing order is different, one can remember the appearance of this character by seeing it as a <i>little needle</i> - the kind used for splitting hairs in <b>half</b>. (Again, according to rule, <i>little</i> takes a stroke beneath it in order to be placed over an element that has no horizontal line at the top.)</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bspeaks">bspeaks</a>] 26-1-2008(361): Imagine karate chopping the number three in<strong> half</strong> with a WALKING STICK and pausing the picture just as the first "board" breaks.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 15-3-2009(38): I think of this as a pictograph, there are three boards to cut, the first one is already in<strong> half</strong> and there are still two more to go.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 26-5-2006(13): What is 1 divided by 2? ONE (vertical stroke) divided by TWO (horizontal strokes) equals one-<strong> HALF</strong>. The ANIMAL-HORNS are your prize for solving this complex math problem.</p>

      <td>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nayelianne">Nayelianne</a>] 17-11-2008(8): If this were a comic drawing, and someone was cutting vegetables in a<strong> half</strong> with a knife real quick, this would be the view from the above of the scene. The ' ´ are just the impact / action marks. And the knife is the</td>
      <td>dividing the two <strong>halves</strong>.</td>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inuki">inuki</a>] 14-8-2006(8): I karate chopped the first one in<strong> half</strong> but for the next two I needed a walking stick.</p>
