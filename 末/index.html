    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>This character is best learned in connection with that of the previous frame. The first stroke shows a branch that is longer than the main branch, indicating that the tree has reached the <b>extremity</b> of its growth, so that its branches stop spreading and start drooping downwards. Be sure to keep this imagery in mind, to avoid confusing this key word with synonyms that will appear later.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amema">amema</a>] 20-11-2007(108): The tree has reached the<strong> extremity</strong> of its growth and no longer produces small, new branches at the top. Instead the existing top branch just grows longer and longer.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 8-4-2008(30): There are no great stories for this one yet, and I always forget it.. So, let's try something ridiculous: The man lived by himself in the wilderness, with no females within miles. So, his only way of relief was to stick his<strong> extremity</strong> into a small hole in a <em>tree</em>.. The poor guy. Which horizontal stroke is the<strong> extremity</strong>? The longer one or the shorter one? That, my friends, is up to your own imaginations. I'd prefer not to dwell on that point, myself. ;).</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta">Dualta</a>] 13-3-2008(29): The <strong>tree's</strong> top branches have grown to <strong>extremities</strong>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NyahK">NyahK</a>] 3-12-2009(23): Another version of that by mameha1977 and dat5h: [Cheat] Remember these as a set: The <em>tree</em> ( 木 ) has <em>not yet</em> ( 未 ) reached the<strong> extremity</strong> ( 末 ) of its <em>vermilion</em> ( 朱 ) foliage.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/arthur">arthur</a>] 18-1-2009(9): It's near the upper<strong> extremity</strong> of the tree that grows the larger branches.</p>
