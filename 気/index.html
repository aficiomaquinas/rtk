    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>The <b>spirit</b> in this character refers to the changeable moods and airs of one's personality as well as to the more essential combination of vital forces that distinguish things and individuals one from the other. Its elements are: <i>reclining</i> . . . <i>floor</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i> . . . <i>sheaf</i>. Do not confuse with <i>spirits</i> (Frame 1930).</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 17-4-2007(130): <em>Captain Hook</em>, his <strong>spirit</strong> crushed, is lying on the ground cursing <em>Wolverine</em> who has defeated him with his far superior claws.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Balaam">Balaam</a>] 2-2-2008(57): You're reclining on the floor trying to hook a sheaf with a small hook through the cracks. That you've been doing this for seven hours without success shows your burning<strong> spirit</strong>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 11-7-2009(34): <em>Wolverine</em> has a fighting<strong> spirit</strong>, and even while <em>reclining</em> on the <em>floor</em> sharpens the <em>hooks</em> on his claws.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 30-5-2006(27): Hint : the first four strokes may be seen as <em>Captain Hook</em> : <em>reclining on the floor</em>, shaking his <em>hook</em> in the air and moaning "Peter Pan! Why did you elude me again! Whyyy!". Se here we have Captain Hook having one of his fits, and about the only thing that will bring him his<strong> spirit</strong> back is a <em>sheaf</em>. The last part probably won't make sense but I am French speaking and somehow I settled onto the image of a "bouquet" of flowers for the word "sheaf".</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 22-5-2009(18): Someone is <em>lying</em> on the <em>floor</em>, a huge <em>x</em> ripped into their stomach with a <em>fishhook</em>. A passer by says "Gen<strong>ki</strong> desu ka".</p>
