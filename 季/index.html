<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 28-11-2006(287): There's a season for planting wheat and there's mating season for having children.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 11-12-2011(102): As the<strong> seasons</strong> pass, the <em>wheat</em> and the <em>children</em> grow, but the wheat grows faster, right over the children.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thora">Thora</a>] 14-3-2008(60): Look at this adorable <em>child</em> with a bale of <em>wheat</em> on his head! He's playing Autumn in his school play the "Four<strong> Seasons</strong>". Aww…too cute! Perhaps we should light the wheat on fire to complete his Autumn costume. (I know, twisted…but I kept forgetting what was on his head).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 27-7-2009(36): When the <em>wheat</em> has grown so high that the farmer can't see his <em>child</em> playing in the field anymore (child under wheat) he knows that the <strong>season</strong> has come to harvest his crops.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ellasevia">ellasevia</a>] 3-3-2010(21): According to Greek mythology, the <strong>seasons</strong> are a result of the <em>wheat</em> goddess's (Demeter) <em>child</em> (Persephone) having been kidnapped by Hades.</p>
