<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 19-2-2007(34): The <strong>city walls</strong> are beautifully built. High above you, shows you the famous <em>mouth</em>s of former city mayors, all smiling down at you, integrated into a total <em>mosaic</em> making the <strong>city walls</strong> a unified beautiful work of art.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 25-7-2009(21): I stand outside the<strong> city walls</strong>, requesting permission to enter. The guard hands me a Rubik's cube and tells me ill only be allowed in after I fit the whole thing in my mouth…</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 12-1-2009(4): The only way to pass through these<strong> city walls</strong> is through this secured <em>mouth</em> here. You have to solve a <em>rubik's cube</em> for it to open.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 13-3-2010(3): The<strong> city walls</strong> had a lovely <em>mosaic</em> design. However, they also had defensive features including <em>openings</em> above through which boiling oil could be poured or cannons fired.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 15-5-2009(2): In Murakami's 'End of the World' scenario, the only way to escape the<strong> city walls</strong> was via the <em>mouth</em> of the river, which the Dreamreader found by piecing his thoughts together like a <em>mosaic</em>.</p>
