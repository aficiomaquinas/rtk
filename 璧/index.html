    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>The <b>holed gem</b> to which this kanji refers is a flat, circular object of about a foot in length, made of stone or glass and having a large hole in the middle. It's elements: <i>ketchup</i> . . . <i>ball</i>.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 30-9-2010(35): This kanji shows a policeman with a <strong>holed gem</strong> (which can be thought of as <em>jewelry</em>, I guess), but he thinks it's a doughnut. For some reason though, he liked his doughnuts with ketchup on them, so he added some, and tried to take a bite. He lost a few teeth on the process.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 9-12-2009(20): <strong>perfection</strong>: Only the tomatoes of perfection, comparable to jewels, were used for the expensive ketchup.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 7-11-2011(19): 完璧 <a href="../v4/3021.html">holed gem</a> (#3021 璧) <strong>Holed Gem</strong> RTK ＃1500.1 ヘキ … Parts: 壁 - 土 , 玉 … Note: This is a new official Kanji added 05/10 to the Japanese lists. Japanese people mix this and 壁 up all the time, so learn them together. <strong>Holed Gem</strong> is the official Heisig Keyword. (though it has nothing to do with IRL usage. IRL this is just the second half of 完璧 . It's only used in that compound, but that compound is very very common, and means <strong>Perfect!</strong> as an exclamation. …</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/drwaltoa">drwaltoa</a>] 15-9-2011(15): It's a little known fact that <em>ketchup</em> is highly corrosive and is used to cut <strong>holes</strong> into <strong>gemstones</strong> so they can be put onto chains. This kanji shows a piece of <em>Jade</em> with a blob of <em>ketchup</em> on the top eating a hole through it.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paasan">paasan</a>] 15-8-2010(8): <strong>Holed Gem</strong>, <em>ketchup</em>, <em>jewel</em>. According to Rikichan, this is bi (ancient Chinese artifact, flat jade or glass disc with a circular hole in the centre). It used to be a perfect un<strong>holed gem</strong> until Indiana Jones showed up and replaced the <em>jewel</em> in the center with <em>ketchup</em>. All they were left with was a piece of worthless glass with a hole in middle. But it did taste good.</p>
