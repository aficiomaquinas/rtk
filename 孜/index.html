<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 15-6-2007(34): Well, yeah, the <em>kid</em>'s<strong> assiduous</strong>: he's got that <em>taskmaster</em> on his back all the time! What else would you expect?</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 9-11-2008(12): <strong>Assiduous</strong> <em>children</em> make<strong> assiduous</strong> <em>taskmasters</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 17-2-2010(5): I'm surprised at how many people seem to think that the key-word 'assiduous' has negative connotations. A quick glance at a decent dictionary will tell you that it is a synonym of diligence, though its emphasis lies more with the painstaking care with which one might go about a task. For this kanji, the<strong> assiduous</strong> <em>child</em><strong> assiduous</strong>ly did as his taskmaster told him, all the while<strong> assiduous</strong>ly planning his escape.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 29-3-2009(4): (Means unceasing; persistent.) 孜 : <em>Kids</em> in the backseat: "Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?" Me (the <em>taskmaster</em>): "No! Shut up! Geez…" But they continued, "Are we there yet? Are we there yet?…" Such<strong> assiduous</strong> <em>children</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 27-7-2008(3): The <em>Hitler</em> <em>Youth</em> had to say their Hitler Youth pledge every single day, which consisted of the following: "We are the young <em>children</em> of the <em>Hitler Youth</em>, and we will work our hardest and do our best…in other words, we will be<strong> assiduous</strong>". Rough.</p>
