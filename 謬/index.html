<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 31-5-2008(22): Check-up (<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1724">check-up</a> (#1724 診)), feathers: When, during the <em>check-up</em>, I noticed that the doctor had feathers sticking out of different bodyparts, I decided that his diagnosis would be<strong> fallible</strong>, since he obviously was a nut.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Crowfoot">Crowfoot</a>] 23-4-2008(11): At my <em>check-up</em>, the doctor tickled me with <em>feathers</em> and I laughed. Doc says it means I'm<strong> fallible</strong>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 30-10-2009(6): Thank god doctors are<strong> fallible</strong>. At my 診 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1724">check-up</a> (#1724 診) mine said I had a 珍 <a href="../v4/1723.html">rare</a> (#1723 珍) case of 疹 <a href="../v4/2574.html">measles</a> (#2574 疹) that would make me liable to fall all the damn time, make me change <em>shape</em>, and could only be cured by sprouting <em>wings</em>. Frightening <em>words</em> indeed but fortunately his fallibility was greater than his credibility.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 28-7-2009(6): I started growing <em>feathers</em>, so I went in for a <em>check-up</em> and they told me I had chicken pox. I guess even physicians are<strong> fallible</strong>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enryu">enryu</a>] 2-9-2009(3): During the check up, the doctor prescribed me a red bull and said "Red bull gives you wings!". Clearly a<strong> fallible</strong> doctor.</p>
