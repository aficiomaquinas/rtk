<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 12-9-2006(193): A true <em>stamp</em> collecting nerd won't be able to<strong> repress</strong> the urge to get his <em>fingers</em> on the latest <em>box</em> of collector <em>stamps</em>!</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 10-8-2007(102): They would <strong>repress</strong> dissents by cutting off their <em>fingers</em> and mailing them to relatives in <em>small boxes</em> (of course including <em>stamps</em> for proper postage).</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 12-4-2008(49): A chikan (bus-molester) tries to<strong> repress</strong> his <em>finger</em>-groping desire by refusing to travel by bus anymore. Instead, he seals himself in a <em>box</em>, makes sure there are enough <em>postage stamps</em> on the outside, and mails himself. He's a good man at heart , you see… just a bit of a slave to his libido. (I suggest using this same Chikan as the primitive for the "box and stamp" combo on the right side of this kanji, which come up more than once later on).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jajaaan">jajaaan</a>] 30-12-2009(29): I'm just gonna say what we're all thinking. Young women work hard to<strong> repress</strong> their urges to put their <em>fingers</em> in their <em>boxes</em> because if their mothers found out, they could be <em>stamped</em> with a big WHORE stamp across their faces for the rest of their lives. Such a stamping is avoided by severe <strong>repression</strong>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 29-12-2006(15): The right side is a rabbit ( 卯 ) that has lost one ear. He (I'm thinking of a cartoony rabbit who has lost the ear in some battle with an enemy) has to<strong> repress</strong> (concretely, with his fingers!) his urge to revenge, which is hard to contain in his little head.</p>
