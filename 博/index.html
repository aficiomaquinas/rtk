    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>At the left we have the <i>needle</i>; at the right, the kanji for <i>specialty</i>, plus an extra <i>drop</i> at the top. Think of a <b>Dr.</b> who is a <i>specialist</i> with a <i>needle</i> (an acupuncturist) and let the <i>drop</i> at the top represent the period at the end of <b>Dr.</b> In principle we are trying to avoid this kind of device, which plays on abstract grammatical conventions; but I think you will agree, after you have had occasion to use the right side of this kanji in forming other kanji, that the exception is merited in this case.</p>
  
  
  	
    <h2>Heisig comment:</h2>
    <p>* The primitive form of this kanji eliminates the <i>needle</i> on the left and gets the meaning of an <i>acupuncturist</i>.</p>
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne">sethimayne</a>] 22-9-2007(307): <em>Ten specialties</em> grants you the title of<strong> Dr.</strong> with a dot.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 29-7-2006(109): Watch for <a href="../v4/1694.html">doctor</a> (#1694 医), the sooner the better! In fact this kanji refers to someone well "learned", with extensive knowledge. This could apply to any kind of field. The kanji 医 ("doctor") is directly related to medicine. I would suggest to take away completely the idea of medicine here, and use a popular character whose name includes the keyword such as "Dr. Who", "Dr. Jekyll", even "Dr. Dobb's" if you're into programming.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DanielC">DanielC</a>] 13-7-2008(37): <em>Needles</em> are a<strong> Dr.</strong>'s <em>specialty</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic">anthropic</a>] 7-7-2008(31): <strong>Dr</strong>. Who weaves like a <em>needle</em> through the fabric of time, to <em>drop</em> in unexpectedly has become his <a href="../v4/46.html">specialty</a> (#46 専) .</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 22-4-2010(17): Note: Use <strong>Ph.D.</strong> rather than <strong>Dr.</strong> to avoid confusion with <strong>doctor</strong> and to be more in line with common use of this kanji. <em>Ten</em> <em>specialities</em> grants you the title of <strong>Ph.D.</strong> with a <em>dot</em>.</p>
