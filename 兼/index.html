    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>At the top we have <i>the animal horns</i> and the single horizontal stroke to give them something to hang onto. Below that, we see one <i>rake</i> with two handles. Finally, we see a pair of strokes splitting away from each of the handles, indicating that they are both splitting under the pressure. The composite picture is of someone holding down two jobs <b>concurrently</b>, using the same kit of tools to move in two different directions and ending up in a mess. Take the time to find this sense in the kanji and it will be easy to remember, despite initial appearances.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 29-1-2008(254): Our ninja hero, disguised as a gardener with a <em>rake</em>, is suddenly attacked from both left and right<strong> concurrently</strong> by bulls with <em>animal horns</em>. Our hero lets out a blood-curdling scream and tears his rake handle vertically in half, so he now has two wooden staffs (<em>split rake handle</em>) to fight with. He grips each staff (left side and right side) and rams it into the horns of the charging bulls. The force of each charging bull causes the tips of each staff to split again (<em>split bottom of each rake handle</em>).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 12-1-2008(68): You decide to take the bull by the <em>horns</em> and do both chores<strong> concurrently</strong>, grabbing your <em>double-handled rake</em> before attempting to clean up both your's and your neighbours' garden. But unfortunately, it's not long until your <em>rake</em> <em>splits in two</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 30-6-2007(26): Special <em>rake</em>, used to hold a bull by both <em>horns</em> <strong>concurrently</strong>. Two handles have V-like ends to set your arms against.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zanzibar">zanzibar</a>] 31-5-2009(17): I'm going to use CASANOVA as the signal image here. A HORNY RAKE of a man who wants to date many women and/or men<strong> concurrently</strong>. The final four strokes, if you look carefully, turn the HORNY RAKE into a head on a body with arms open wide to embrace you. Run away!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 24-1-2010(15): <strong>Concurrently</strong> Primitive: Sarah Palin. She's<strong> concurrently</strong> Governor of Alaska and the vice presidential nominee. Quite a job. Some days she's shooting moose and mounting the <em>horns</em> on her wall. Other days she's being a maverick and <em>raking</em> up corruption in her own party. There's so much corruption she needs <em>two</em> rakes. She likes to do this all while wearing a <em>red skirt</em>. You can see the skirt flailing out on either side.</p>
