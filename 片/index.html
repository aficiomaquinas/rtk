    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>This kanji is based on the pictograph of a tree with some branches going upwards and others hanging down, split right down the middle. When that picture's right side is isolated, it becomes the kanji for <b>one-sided</b>, in the sense of only one part of a whole.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saranich">saranich</a>] 11-12-2006(282): Fuaburisu's pictograph of a man kneeling and presenting the ring to his future wife is a<strong> one-sided</strong> version of the story. Others say he was giving her the finger.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 5-2-2006(121): Taking the keyword in the sense of only one part of a whole, I see this as a pictograph of a man kneeling and presenting the ring to his future wife (I couldn't see any trees or branches in there).</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 21-7-2009(45): A<strong> one-sided</strong> romance–he proposes and she says no. (Thanks to fuaburisu).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Odieone">Odieone</a>] 15-12-2008(15): If you look at this image from <strong>one side</strong>, it looks like the <strong>top hat</strong> is floating over a <strong>chair</strong>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 5-1-2010(8): There is also other side (left-side) of the tree, which is the kanji - 爿(radical no. 90, which has the meaning of "piece of wood" and was earlier used in <a href="../v4/239.html">status quo</a> (#239 状), <a href="../v4/321.html">robust</a> (#321 壮), <a href="../v4/731.html">leader</a> (#731 将), but then was simplified to "half-turtle" element). Now put them together - 爿片 - and you can see a tree.</p>
