<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 19-4-2007(206): There once was a lonely little pig that constantly followed Spiderman, always nuzzling his leg and oinking tenderly. Spiderman finally caved in and decided to keep the little pig under one condition: the <em>pig</em> was to take a <em>broom</em> and sweep up all of <em>Spiderman's leftover threads</em> after having fought crime. The pig felt such<strong> affinity</strong> for Spiderman, he happily accepted—and did a good job too.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 8-2-2008(159): Spiderman has no<strong> affinity</strong> for a broom hence his house is a pig sty.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 23-10-2007(67): I hate doing this, since the Simpson's Movie was recent. But think of the<strong> AFFINITY</strong> Homer had with the PIG that was to be killed. The<strong> AFFINITY</strong> first had SPIDER PIG (Spiderpig, spiderpig, does whatever a spiderpig does). Then Homer dressed the PIG up with a BROOM and glasses making him Harry PORKER. Homer had more<strong> AFFINITY</strong> for that PIG than his family, hence hilarity ensues.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop">richcoop</a>] 5-8-2008(28): There is an<strong> affinity</strong> between the THREADS of a BROOM and a SOW's hair.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sindhikara">sindhikara</a>] 30-12-2008(19): Spiderman, though genuinely a good person, had an<strong> affinity</strong> for beating <em>pigs</em> with a <em>broom</em>. (I know it's random, but the mental picture is both vivid and hilarious).</p>
