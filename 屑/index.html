<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 10-10-2007(80): You aren't supposed to throw an American <em>flag</em> out with the<strong> rubbish</strong>. The proper way to get rid of a flag is to burn it, shown here by holding a <em>candle</em> underneath it.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 27-7-2008(7): Japanese society has always been quite environmentally conscious. Even back in the Edo period, they had an ingenious method for punishing people that didn't properly separate their<strong> rubbish</strong>. If, for example, you threw your ペットボトル into the paper can, a large <em>Semaphore Flag</em> would fly up out of nowhere and alert people, and a <em>candle</em> would fly out of the can and catch you on fire, so that people would know immediately who the perpetrator was.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 2-10-2010(3): Protestors treat the <em>flags</em> like<strong> rubbish</strong> and set them ablaze using <em>candles</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jesse">jesse</a>] 27-2-2011(2): Burning a <em>flag</em> with a <em>candle</em> is a<strong> rubbish</strong> idea. Why would you want to do that?</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 12-5-2007(2): Lately, the dustman has been leaving my <strong>rubbish</strong> at the curb. This time, I've put a <em>flag</em> there, and for good measure I've added an item of fireworks which emits <em>sparks</em>. He shan't overlook my <strong>rubbish</strong> this time!</p>
