    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>This kanji is the 12th sign of the Chinese zodiac: the <b>sign of the hog</b>. It is best learned by thinking of an acorn-eating <b>hog</b> in connection with the primitive meaning given below.</p>
  
  
  	
    <h2>Heisig comment:</h2>
    <p>* The <i>top hat</i> represents the external shape of the <i>acorn</i>, and the unusual but easily written complex of strokes beneath it (which you might also see as distortions of an <i>elbow</i> and <i>person</i>) stands for the mysterious secret whereby the <i>acorn</i> contains the oak tree in a nutshell.</p>
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Floatingweed5">Floatingweed5</a>] 20-11-2007(193): A greedy hog in a top hat who has eaten all of the acorns. He even elbows people out of the way to get them.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tryllid">tryllid</a>] 8-10-2008(39): Top Hat + Elbow + Person: The<strong> sign of the hog</strong> was a very recognizable tattoo - a hog with a big grin in a <em>top hat</em>, sticking his <em>elbow</em> into the <em>person</em> next to him.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/roundrabbit">roundrabbit</a>] 8-9-2009(26): This is easy, if you know Mr. Peanut, the logo of Planters. Replace his face or body with an acorn and you have Mr. Acorn, the logo /<strong> sign of the hog</strong>. He wears the same <em>top hat</em>, has the same turned out <em>elbow</em> holding a diagonal <em>walking stick</em>, and poses like a <em>human</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tobberoth">Tobberoth</a>] 25-11-2008(18): Warning: Stroke order in book is wrong. The top hat should be written as normal.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 8-6-2007(13): Q: What is the difference between a pig and a hog? A: A hog is the generic term for all swine. Pigs are immature hogs weighing less than 125 pounds. Other swine related terms include the following: Piglet: a baby swine less than ten weeks old (nursing pig) Sow: a female pig that has had a litter Boar: a male hog (with tusks?).</p>
