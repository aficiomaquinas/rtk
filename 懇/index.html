<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 15-10-2006(181): The skunk here is Pepe LePew of Looney Tunes fame. He's a very<strong> sociable</strong> skunk, as far as skunks go, but instead of having a "heart of gold" he has a heart of silver (since he always finishes second in the game of love).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 9-11-2005(89): The skunk here is Pepe LePew of Looney Tunes fame. He's a very<strong> sociable</strong> skunk, as far as skunks go, but instead of having a "heart of gold" he has a heart of silver.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/takoman">takoman</a>] 23-6-2008(62): (コン) Skunk and silver appear together in a few kanji so I combined them to make a <em>silver skunk</em> character. This skunk, due to a random fluke, is not black and white, but actually silver colored. Which means this skunk can pass, say for, a cat (aka Over the Hedge). When the skunk realized the odd coloring wasn't a curse but actually a blessing, it realized in it's <em>heart </em>that it could be<strong> sociable</strong> with all sorts of animals that normally would run away from smelly skunks.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 20-7-2007(18): The skunk is very<strong> sociable</strong> at the party, telling everyone all about his <em>silver</em> <em>heart</em>. // Primitive: top left: <em>skunk</em> = a skunk <em>clawing</em> at a <em>sow</em>. The 3rd claw gets broken.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mentat_kgs">mentat_kgs</a>] 19-7-2008(14): I'm using the top of the kanji as a lawyer: The lawyer is nothing but a skunk dressed in a silver suit. Also lawyers have no heart, they only fake it to be<strong> sociable</strong>.</p>
