    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>&quot;In the <b>beginning</b>...&quot;&nbsp;starts that marvelous shelf of books we call the Bible. It talks about how all things were made, and tells us that when the Creator came to humanity she made <i>two</i> of them, man and woman. While we presume she made <i>two</i> of every other animal as well, we are not told as much. Hence we need only&nbsp;<i>two</i> and a pair of <i>human legs</i> come to the kanji that means <b>beginning</b>.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mukade">mukade</a>] 10-7-2007(236): In the<strong> beginning</strong> were just <em>two</em> who walked on <em>human legs</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuki11">Tsuki11</a>] 29-10-2007(71): In the<strong> beginning</strong> God created woman, and God asked her how she liked his work. Woman replied, "Well, you know how I have <em>two</em> eyes, <em>two</em> arms, <em>two legs</em>… it seems redundant to have three breasts. It would look more symmetrical with <em>two</em>." God nodded, and the middle breast fell off… and it was good. Woman picked up the breast and said, "Thank you, God! But what do I do with this useless boob?" And God created man. That's why the women today only have <em>two</em> boobs to match their <em>two human legs</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smiro">smiro</a>] 18-11-2007(46): Every journey begins with your two legs.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tatiana">Tatiana</a>] 10-10-2006(14): Grandpa Woody always began stories from his youth with "In the<strong> beginning</strong>, when I had <em>two</em> <em>legs</em>…".</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/domokun1134">domokun1134</a>] 24-11-2009(8): In the<strong> beginning</strong> we start out with nothing but our own two legs.</p>
