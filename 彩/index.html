<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 29-3-2007(102): In Sydney we occasionally get exotic birds. You first notice a <strong>colouring</strong> in a <em>tree</em>. You look more carefully and you make out the <em>shape</em> of a bird (here represented by its <em>claws</em>).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 18-12-2006(77): <em>Mystique</em> the shape-shifter changes the<strong> coloring</strong> of her skin to camouflage tones and perches herself in a <em>tree</em> like a <em>vulture</em> waiting for her pray.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 25-1-2008(75): <strong>warning:</strong> There is a mistake in the 4th edition, that's not a <em>fledgling</em> primitive on the left. It should be obvious but somehow I didn't notice it when I learned that one yesterday. v__v.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko">Nuriko</a>] 14-4-2008(51): A little kid about age 3 is<strong> coloring</strong> something that his teacher can't quite make out. It's just kind of a blob… an unknown shape. She asks, "What's that?" Of course, the child expects the teacher to know what it is and is offended that she didn't recognize what the shape/blob was. "Don't you see it's a vulture in a tree!?" Obviously very upset by this, the child's next drawing is of the vulture flying down from the tree and pecking the teacher to death.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 23-11-2009(45): When<strong> coloring</strong> something in you <em>grab</em> the crayon of choice to fill in the <em>shape</em>s.</p>
