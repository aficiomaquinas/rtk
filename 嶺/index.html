<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 7-3-2007(46): This <em>mountain</em> lies exactly between two prefectures, so naturally there was a struggle about which prefecture had <em>jurisdiction</em> there. And would you believe it, one of them gained jurisdiction over the base, and the other over the<strong> mountaintop</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 15-11-2009(9): In war whoever seizes the<strong> MOUNTAINTOP</strong> can use their firepower from the MOUNTAIN to control the surrounding JURISDICTIONs.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 28-7-2009(6): At the top of the <em>mountain</em>, Bill Clinton found an intern and said "This<strong> mountaintop</strong> is my <a href="../v4/1405.html">jurisdiction</a> (#1405 領). I <em>order</em> you to give me <em>head</em>." The intern replied, "Come on Bill, hasn't this type of behaviour caused enough problems already?".</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 18-11-2007(4): Most hierarchies are shaped like a <em>mountain</em>, to so who has <em>jurisdiction</em> over what. So, everyone wants to be on the<strong> mountaintop</strong>, because as they all say: the shit in this company always rolls downhill.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wilsoncb">wilsoncb</a>] 23-8-2010(1): Law enforcement officials who don't want to climb the mountain say that their jurisdiction is only up to 5000 feet, so the top of the mountain is out of bounds.</p>
