<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 29-11-2012(45): If you get caught in an<strong> eddy</strong>, the <em>water</em> seems <em>determined</em> to pull you in. (Edit: As Sam79's post says, "eddy" isn't a good keyword. This kanji refers to things that stop moving such as water, air, speech, etc. "Stagnate" has been used elsewhere, so maybe "go stale," "stall," or "stop moving" would be suitable keywords. Story: The <em>water</em> reaches a <em>determined</em> position and <strong>stops moving</strong>).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 24-7-2009(15): An<strong> eddy</strong> is created when <em>water</em> <em>determines</em> it doesn't want to just "go with the flow".</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sam79">Sam79</a>] 8-3-2012(4): Watch out, I think the keyword gets it wrong - at least I picture something dynamic for<strong> eddy</strong> - but all the meanings in the dictionary suggest stagnation, dead water and the like. That makes sense ethymologically, we have water that is determined - not do do anything to you, but in the sense that it's situation and location is fixed.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 27-9-2006(2): The <em>water determined</em> itself in the shape of an<strong> eddy</strong>, and we were all drawn towards the center of it!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sabretou">sabretou</a>] 21-4-2013(1): <strong>Eddy</strong> is <em>determined</em> to sail through the <em>waters</em> of an<strong> eddy</strong> even though he's been told it's futile.</p>
