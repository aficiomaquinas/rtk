    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>No doubt you will find it in your heart to forgive me for forcing yet another Japanese word on you in this frame. It is not the last time it will happen in this book, but I can assure you they are used only when absolutely necessary. One <b><i>rin</i></b> is equal to about 1/1000 of a yen - or rather was worth that much when it still made economic sense to mint them. While inflation took its toll on this kanji as a monetary unit, it survived with the not at all surprising sense of something &quot;very, very tiny.&quot; The kanji shows a <i>cliff</i> with a <i>computer</i> under it, apparently because it has been pushed over into the abyss by someone fed up with the thing. The total market value of one home <i>computer</i> that has fallen over rock and bramble for several hundred feet: about one <b><i>rin</i></b>!</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep">krungthep</a>] 26-3-2008(198): I threw my<strong> Rin</strong>dows <em>computer</em> off a <em>cliff</em> because it kept crashing. Now, after its last crash, it's worth less than a<strong> rin</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomusan">tomusan</a>] 16-2-2008(76): A <em>computer</em> dropped off of a <em>cliff</em> would be worth about 1<strong> RIN</strong>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD">PeterJD</a>] 7-4-2008(50): The Square Root of 1 RI = 1<strong> RIN</strong>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 12-7-2007(33): He dropped his <em>computer</em> from the top of the <em>cliff</em> and it turned to smithe-<strong> rin</strong> -s.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 26-3-2007(25): Looking down at the 里 from the high cliff above such a tiny country village looks even smaller like something very very tiny and insignificant… Like a りん /<strong> Rin</strong>. Also might be worth-while to note now that this isn't just 1/10th of a 銭 but also 1/10th of a 分 or rather… 0.3mm in length. Perhaps imagine holding up a ruler from that high up to measure the tiny speck of a 里 below and note it coming out to 0.3mm in length. <a href="midori://search?text=ずっとずっと小さいですね～">ずっとずっと小さいですね～</a> !!</p>
