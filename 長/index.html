<h2>Reading:</h2>

<h3>On-Yomi: <a>チョウ</a> — Kun-Yomi: <a>なが.い、おさ</a></h3>


	
    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>hairpin Here we have a quasi-pictograph of the colorful and decorated clips used to bind up long hair. Note its similarity to the scarf, which differs only by the addition of one stroke. [4]</p>
	

  	
    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>In line with the story of the preceding frame, the <i>hair</i> that needs the <i>hairpin</i> is <b>long</b>.</p>
  
  
  	
    <h2>Heisig comment:</h2>
    <p>* The primitive of this kanji has two more shapes in addition to that of the kanji itself. Above its relative primitive, it is abbreviated form will mean <i>hair</i>. Further abbreviated,  it will mean the long, mangy <i>mane</i> of an animal.</p>
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 7-10-2007(152): The Geisha with<strong> long</strong> <em>hair</em> uses an ornate lacquered <em>hairpin</em> to bundle it all up.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 22-6-2008(74): The top of this one reminds me of the staple primitive. So here's my story: The girl's hair was so<strong> long</strong> that she had to use <em>staples</em> instead of <em>hairpins</em>. It worked, but stapling her hair to her head was kinda painful.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 5-1-2006(25): As a primitive I use the image of (very)<strong> long</strong> hair. Let this kanji represent a "Swiss Hairpin" (similar to a Swiss army knife) : the top part being a pictogram for <em>half a comb</em>, and the lower part being the <em>hairpin</em>. Just make sure not to confuse with the kanji for "comb". Think of this one as a "<em>half a comb</em>" that can be pulled from the "Swiss Hairpin".</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 12-3-2008(14): HAIRPIN: This is rather similar to that for SCARF. Both a HAIRPIN and a SCARF can be used for holding back<strong> long</strong> hair. STORY: The first 4 strokes could be a pictograph of hair blowing in the wind. It's too<strong> LONG</strong> and getting in your way, so you pin it back.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 30-11-2009(8): The<strong> long</strong> haired Geisha <em>staples</em> on an ornate <em>hairpin</em> so it won't slip. (Thanks to Zactacular for the idea.).</p>
