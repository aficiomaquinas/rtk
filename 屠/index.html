<h2 id="koohii-stories">Koohii stories:</h2>

<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 11-11-2006(23): Generals usually see their soldiers as mere <em>puppets</em> in their war game. These poor sods are given a <em>flag</em> and told to fight for their country. As if that would make good all the<strong> butchering</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 5-5-2008(12): Flag, lovedoll: My first suspicion was mitigated since my <em>lovedoll</em> was still giving me good lovin'. But when I noticed that little <em>flag</em> which had suddenly appeared on her left breast, I knew something was wrong. Checking her diary, I find out that a <em>lovedoll</em> coup was underway, which would involve<strong> butchering</strong> all owners!</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 4-11-2007(11): <em>Chucky from Child's Play</em> was found<strong> butchering</strong> a poor victim with a <em>flag</em> pole.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/this_is_douglas">this_is_douglas</a>] 17-7-2009(7): The <em>ninja</em> objects to<strong> butchering</strong> people, it goes against his principles, so instead he wraps them up in a <em>ninja flag</em> for the authorities to deal with!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 29-6-2010(6): My <em>love doll</em> raised a <em>flag</em> but I was too rough with her and ended up<strong> butchering</strong> the poor thing (Thank goodness for the patch kit that came with her!).</p>
