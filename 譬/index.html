<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 28-7-2009(52): A<strong> parable</strong> is like putting <em>ketchup</em> on <em>words</em> to make them easier to swallow.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 1-6-2008(3): Ketchup, words: Do you know the<strong> parable</strong> of "The <em>Ketchup</em> and the Holy <em>Word</em>"? No? Well, it's about a boy who spilled <em>ketchup</em> on the Holy <em>Word</em> and then got punished by a priest. Lesson: don't use <em>ketchup</em> above the scripture.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 25-11-2009(2): I have a great<strong> parable</strong> about anal sex (the true meaning of what Heisig calls ketchup) but I can't say it here.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 5-3-2010(1): Have you heard the<strong> parable</strong> of the <em>ketchup</em>? "Yea, as too much <em>ketchup</em> can ruin a good hot dog, so too can too many <em>words</em> ruin thy reputation. Be sparing, with the <em>ketchup</em>, my brethren, and also spare thy <em>words</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 7-8-2008(1): One of <em>Socrates</em>'<strong> parable</strong>s. He once had a student who didn't like anything. This student decided that the way to make things better was to put <em>ketchup</em> on them. Made carrots taste better, made annoying alarm clocks shut up, made ugly girls cry and run away. <em>Socrates</em> heard about this, and told him he should stop. The student said no, this was the only way to make things agreeable for him. "Then maybe you should put ketchup on me," he said. The student saw the error of his ways.</p>
