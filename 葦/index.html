<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/At0m5k">At0m5k</a>] 12-8-2009(23): After breaking up with her boyfriend and ditching him, she threw the <em>flower</em>s and <em>locket</em> he gave her into the <strong>ditch reeds</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 13-9-2006(12): The lost <em>locket</em> was found between the <em>flowers</em> of the<strong> ditch reed</strong>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 31-5-2007(10): As soon as Iris decided to<strong> ditch reed</strong> she took off the <em>locket</em> he gave her and tossed it along with the <em>corsage</em> into the nearest ditch. Iris is quite a bitch to<strong> ditch reed</strong> on the night of the prom!</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BladeWalker">BladeWalker</a>] 12-7-2012(6): THANK GOD THIS IS THE LAST OF THE FLOWER KANJI IN RTK3. There were 65 of them! Time to <strong>ditch</strong> all these <strong>reed</strong>s, and seal all of these <em>flowers</em> away in the <em>locket</em> of your mind.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 5-3-2010(2): Small tip: RtK3 is plagued with a number of altogether unremarkable plant keywords. So it might be useful to give the keywords themselves a secondary meaning based on homonyms (most of us do this anyway) So for me any kind of reed is <strong>Elliot Reid</strong> from the TV show Scrubs. If you've seen it, making up stories will be very easy.</p>
