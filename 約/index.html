    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>Consider for a moment the etymology of the word &quot;<b>promise</b>&quot; in order to notice its roots in the activity of putting one thing (e.g., one's word of honor) in place of another (e.g., the fulfillment of a task). For as it turns out, this character also means &quot;to abridge, economize, and abbreviate&quot; - all activities that involve putting one thing in place of another. With that in mind, we may now work with the elements: <i>thread</i> . . . <i>ladle</i>.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eatyoda">eatyoda</a>] 27-10-2008(150): Anytime <em>Spiderman</em> breaks a<strong> promise</strong>, Aunt Mae hits him one over with her <em>ladle</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36">laner36</a>] 2-10-2007(125): Spiderman<strong> promise</strong>d to get Aunt Mae's ladle back. He started to do a blood oath by spilling drops of blood but Aunt Mae stopped him and bound up the wound. "It's only a ladle Peter".</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 13-12-2006(35): Thread + bound + drop of blood. Blood oath is a<strong> promise</strong>, where a drop of blood turns into a binding thread.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 19-4-2010(24): <em>Spiderman</em> broke his<strong> promise</strong> to be home in time for dinner. When he came in late, Aunt Mae beat him viciously with a <em>ladle</em>. She just kept hitting, and hitting, and hitting until he lost consciousness, and even then she still kept <em>ladling</em> his pulpy carcass for like fifteen more minutes. Don't break<strong> promise</strong>s to Aunt Mae.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rakushun">Rakushun</a>] 30-8-2007(17): <em>Spiderman</em> and Spiderwoman share a <em>drop</em> of blood (the blood handshake thing, like in Natural Born Killers) to <em>bind</em> their<strong> promise</strong> that they'll always fight crime. Ladle was too hard. <em>Spiderman</em><strong> PROMISE</strong>S to get MJs cooking <em>ladle</em> back.</p>
