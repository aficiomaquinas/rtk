<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 14-7-2007(111): The Column of 300 spartans were in a<strong> delicate</strong> situation. They had travelled in one line (using only their legs) to the mountain pass to face the fierce Persian task master.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cingold">cingold</a>] 18-9-2009(74): We're <em>going</em> up the <em>mountain</em> announces the <em>taskmaster</em>. Anyone with <em>legs</em> too<strong> delicate</strong> must stay behind.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 4-10-2007(63): [The sense of<strong> delicate</strong> implied by this Kanj – easily broken, weak, brittle, insignificant] A <em>column</em> of <em>taskmasters</em> is trying to <em>leg</em>-press <em>one</em> <em>mountain</em> between them. They are old and frail, and their legs skinny and<strong> delicate</strong>. A <em>single</em> pair of <em>legs</em> wouldn't be able to achive anything in this case. However, together they manage to push the <em>mountain</em> up towards the sky.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 16-11-2008(38): Here we have a taskmaster who orders a <strong>mountain</strong> to <strong>go</strong> away. The mountain is so frightened that it sprouts two little<strong> delicate</strong> <strong>legs</strong> and gingerly walks away. Be sure to imagine the legs as really tiny and the mountain as really big so the<strong> delicate</strong>-ness is there.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 13-10-2007(19): The fellowship of the ring had to move as a <em>column</em> <strong>delicate</strong>ly through the mines of moria. The <em>mountain</em> was above them with <em>legs</em> hanging from the <em>ceiling</em>, no doubt left there by the <em>taskmaster</em> they didn't want to awaken.</p>
