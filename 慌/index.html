<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 19-9-2006(154): (re: wazzab) The <em>state of mind</em> of the people of New Orleans as they examined their city's concert hall <em>laid waste</em> can best described as<strong> disconcerted</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99">dshill99</a>] 8-5-2008(93): When I am<strong> disconcerted</strong> my <em>state of mind</em> is "<em>laid to waste</em>".</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 26-2-2008(50): Data walks in and sees Picard weeping. "What is the matter, Captain?" Picard looks up, and replies that his entire home planet has been <em>laid to waste</em>. Data, the master of tact, offers up this consolation: "Ah. I can see how that would be <strong>DISCONCERT</strong>ing". It turns out that the <em>flow of tears</em> was really just because Picard had lost his chance at getting at some rare (and thus valuable) <em>flowers</em> on his home planet.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(45): In this kanji we see a<strong> disconcerted</strong> as a mind which has been laid waste by a flood of contradicting information. Try to picture someone's head being flooded, looking left and right in disconcert, and the switch on top of their head turning on and off uncontrollably.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 1-6-2007(38): <em>Data</em> was<strong> disconcerted</strong> to find that he had been <em>laid waste</em> in a robot scrap yard. "This is very disconcerting", he says in the calmest possible manner given his unfortunate predicament. Make sure you see him there, looking around trying to analyse how his Captain could have abandoned him.</p>
