<h2>Reading:</h2>

<h3>On-Yomi: <a>ショウ</a> — Kun-Yomi: <a>ほ.める</a></h3>


	
    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>outhouse The combination of the element for little, the basic &quot;roof&quot; structure here (in which the chimney was overwritten, as it was in the element for vulture), combined with the &quot;window&quot; (mouth) below, gives this element its meaning of outhouse. Although the window is not an essential part of an outhouse, I think you will agree that its inclusion is a boon to the imagination, greatly simplifying the learning of the characters in which it appears.

    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>Outhouse . . . shellfish.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 22-6-2008(153): You won first<strong> PRIZE</strong> in a <em>shell-fish</em> eating contest. Unfortunately you spent the whole night in the <em>outhouse</em> after.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 19-5-2007(123): As a<strong> prize</strong> for being the 1,000,000th person to use the restaurant's <em>outhouse</em>, I got all the <em>clams</em> I could eat.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 1-5-2006(114): This is a bit silly.. or maybe not only a bit, but.. You know some foodstuffs (cereals come to mind) sometimes have<strong> prize</strong>s mixed in them? Well, in this case, the<strong> prize</strong> was a shell (money, remember) and you only notice in the outhouse… (see also <a href="../v4/904.html">secret</a> (#904 秘)).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 21-2-2007(46): You win! Your<strong> prize</strong> is an <em>outhouse</em> filled with <em>shellfish</em>! (Just imagine the disbelief of the contestant…).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dinmamma">dinmamma</a>] 14-8-2009(20): Winning the Nobel<strong> prize</strong> gives you <em>ESTEEM ON TOP OF MONEY</em>. (this helps you remember the layout of the kanji too.).</p>
