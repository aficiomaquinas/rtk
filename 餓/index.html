<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 13-12-2006(278): All those starving models in Hollywood - they want to <em>eat</em>, but their <em>ego</em> (about their appearance and trim look) makes sure they grin and bear it!</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop">richcoop</a>] 8-10-2008(106): He<strong> starve</strong>s for FOOD but his EGO won't let him beg.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 17-7-2006(31): He was <strong>starving</strong> for <em>food</em>, but he had too much <em>ego</em> and was too proud to ask for <em>food</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crayonmaster">crayonmaster</a>] 5-4-2009(18): A group of high class chefs were trapped in a fast food restaurant. They had such a big ego, they refused to eat any hamburgers, and they all<strong> starve</strong>d to death.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zanzibar">zanzibar</a>] 10-6-2009(9): People use the phrase "I'm starving" too casually. They just want some FOOD, and their EGO causes them to magnify their terminology for effect. If they were really to<strong> starve</strong>, they'd lose their EGOs, and absolutely anything would become FOOD.</p>
