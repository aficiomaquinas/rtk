    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>Think of this key word as referring to a political <b>party</b>, not a gala affair. Its elements: <i>human legs</i> . . . sticking out of an <i>outhouse</i> window.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle">calittle</a>] 2-10-2007(424): Every major political<strong> party</strong>, if personified, would look like a giant <em>outhouse</em> walking around with <em> human legs</em> spewing out a constant stream of bullshit.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 4-9-2007(50): Every political<strong> party</strong> is full of shit. But nobody ever says how they get that way. Well, here's your answer - a political<strong> party</strong> memer is in the outhouse, greedily chowing down on the contents inside. He's grown so accustomed to the taste that he's in all the way, and all you can see are his legs through the window. He'll come inside later to the auditorium to make a speech and spew everything out.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 1-11-2007(39): Here's an easy one from current events. Recently a certain senator, member of a family-values political<strong> party</strong>, was caught in an <em>outhouse</em> touching the <em>human legs</em> of the guy in the stall next to him - who happened to be a police officer. True story, folks - search for "wide stance senator" for details.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ctraabe">ctraabe</a>] 25-3-2008(12): Politicians in the (insert<strong> party</strong> name here)<strong> party</strong> deliver so much bullcrap, they might as well be outhouses on legs.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pacersfan218">pacersfan218</a>] 1-9-2007(10): Since he refused to become a member of the Chinese Communist<strong> Party</strong>, he was shoved into the outhouse with only his legs sticking out.</p>
