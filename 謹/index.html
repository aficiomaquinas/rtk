<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 16-1-2008(224): Muttering words of gratitude for a wonderful meal, I<strong> discreet</strong>ly slipped my cabbage under the table for the dog.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 10-2-2008(135): <em>Cabbage</em> primitive: When a <em>cabbage</em> is <em>growing up</em>, you must put it in your <em>mouth</em> before it <em>flowers</em>, because that's when it becomes bitter. Seriously, it's called 'bolting' or something. When you're<strong> discreet</strong>, you try to make your <em>words</em> like a <em>cabbage</em>: well-layered, but in an unassuming way.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kodorakun">kodorakun</a>] 6-5-2010(55): HOW TO REMEMBER CABBAGE: it's the flower that is shoved in your mouth while you are growing up (parents force feed you cabbage), note how the "grow up" primitive is pushed into the mouth primitive overlapping. "Muttering words of gratitude for a wonderful meal, I<strong> discreet</strong>ly slipped my cabbage under the table for the dog.".</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 27-12-2006(37): Be<strong> discreet</strong> and don't say to old people that their heads look like cabbages, even if they're all wrinkles.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 5-1-2009(26): Instead of cabbage here I see the Piranha Plant from Super Mario bros. It's a flower with a mouth and it grows up out of a pipe! Seems to make sense to me. But instead of regular Mario you have Socrates! So here is what is going on. Two Piranha Plants are<strong> discreet</strong>ly discussing when they will come up out of their pipes to hit Socrates. They have to talk<strong> discreet</strong>ly however becuase Socrates is standing right next to their pipes.</p>
