    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>This character, used for everything from little <b>humps</b> of hills to camel <b>humps</b>, easily suggests the hunch on the pig's back and hind parts where the best cuts of meat are to be found (and hence the English expression for luxury, &quot;living high off the hog.&quot;) The elements we have to work with are: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>walking legs</i> . . . <i>cell</i>.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
