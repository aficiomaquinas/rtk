<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 6-3-2007(186): Two<strong> weak</strong> archers agree on a duel to the death. They constantly shoot at each other but never manage to hit their target. But what they lack in skill they make up in determination, and they keep shooting for hours, and days, and months, until it's wintertime and their <em>bows</em> are coated in <em>ice</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru">raseru</a>] 8-4-2008(124): BOWS with ICE on them are brittle and<strong> WEAK</strong>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 8-11-2007(92): I'm missing this Kanji too much, so here's another take: Look at the two BOWS and you'll see it looks like FEATHERS at the base of the BOWS. So, imagine two indian children who are still too<strong> WEAK</strong> to pull a real bow, so their parents make two BOWS from two long FEATHERS. Now the<strong> WEAK</strong> children can pretend they have real BOWS. Two FEATHER BOWS.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 12-3-2007(22): <em>Two bows</em> with <em>ice</em> on them are still<strong> weak</strong>er than one bow without.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Fangio">Fangio</a>] 13-2-2012(11): These two archers are so <strong>weak</strong> it's just as if their <em>bows</em> were shooting <em>feathers</em>.</p>
