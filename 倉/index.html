    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>The single <i>gate</i> is used here not in order to represent one <i>gate</i>, but many of them, indeed a <i>meeting of gates</i>. Add <i>mouth</i> (as an entrance here) and you end up with <b>godown</b>. That should help keep this character distinct from <i>warehouse</i> (Frame 633).</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 5-10-2007(256): (Warning-this one is crude) Imagine a<strong> godown</strong> (dockside warehouse) where you can <em>meet</em> girls who will <em>godown</em> on you with their <em>mouth</em>. To keep the place a bit of a secert, they only have one <em>gate</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 26-10-2005(56): Hint : the "godown" is like a warehouse, it's on the docks and mostly in Asia. To make an image distinct from that of "warehouse" or "storehouse", etc, I picture the goods stored there, piled up on pallets really high, and thus they have to "godown" before they can be taken outside. The front of this<strong> godown</strong> is a "<em>meeting of small gates</em>", i.e. a row of gates through which goods come in and out. The <em>mouth</em> can be an opening somewhere in the back, or the top, where cranes lift down the goods.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 27-3-2008(48): <strong>Note:</strong> this is not <em>gate</em> but actually a variation of <em>door</em> and is written as such, with the vertical stroke last not first.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matsuyamakiwi">matsuyamakiwi</a>] 29-6-2008(30): Imagine a mafia<strong> godown</strong> at the docks where shifty mafia types <em>meet</em> and lots of dodgy deals<strong> godown</strong>. This is a very secret place, so there is only one <em>gate</em>, and to enter you have to say the password with your <em>mouth</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 9-9-2007(22): A <strong>godown</strong> is an old style warehouse where goods were temporarily stacked stacked to the <em>roof</em>(meeting). A series of <em>gates</em> with <em>mouths</em>(doors) were used access them for shipment.
