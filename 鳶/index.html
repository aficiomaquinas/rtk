<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 5-2-2008(25): The<strong> kite falcon</strong> is a majestic <em>bird</em> that flies in the sky as fast as an <em>arrow</em>. So much so that its feathers are often used to make arrows.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 1-12-2008(3): A man from the medievil times goes hunting for <strong>falcons</strong>, he aims his <em>arrow</em>, shoots and runs to look at the <em>bird</em> he got. Sadly it was just a <strong>kite</strong> and he'd made some poor boy very upset.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 5-6-2008(3): Arrow, bird: The <strong>black kite</strong> is a <em>bird</em> of prey (like the raptor). You can see it approaching its target, like an <em>arrow</em> speeding through the air.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 19-3-2010(2): In RTK3 2 ed. this is <strong>black kite</strong>. A ubiquitous Japanese falcon. One diagnostic feature of these birds is that their tails are v-shaped just like the tail of an <em>arrow</em>. Note: Story for kunyomi - (Two Shakespearean birders with binocs) One says, "That <em>bird</em>, トビ or not トビ?" The other replies, "Good question. Judging by <em>arrow</em>-tail, I'd say トビ.".</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 18-7-2007(1): The<strong> kite falcon</strong> flies like a kite so people fire <em>arrows</em> at it to try and bring it down.</p>
