<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 26-3-2008(38): No way that <em>sweet</em> girl can <strong>fit</strong> those <em>mountains</em> of hers <strong>into</strong> an A-cup. They'll be severely <em>lacking</em> space. Too many <em>sweets</em> I guess.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 9-11-2008(28): (from mantixen's) I was going to take some <em>sweets</em> on my climb up the <em>mountain</em>, but it wouldn't<strong> fit into</strong> my bag, so I <em>lack</em> them.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nath04">nath04</a>] 27-4-2010(12): This means really "got into" something - " ゲームに嵌まっちゃった "　- I became hooked on Video games (Tae Kim). I really <strong>got into</strong> <em>mountain</em> climbing lately but I <em>lack</em> fitness due to eating too many <em>sweets</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 23-3-2008(8): You may feel that it would be impossible to get an entire <em>mountain</em> to <strong>fit into</strong> a <em>wicker basket</em>, but not for this Illusionist … watch him <em>yawn</em> as he does so with ease!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shirahime">shirahime</a>] 13-1-2008(3): That poor girl, she's never going to<strong> fit into</strong> that dress. It would be like trying to fit a mountain into a picnic basket. One yawn and the whole thing would blow apart.</p>
