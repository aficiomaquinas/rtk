    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>If you look into the flickering of a <i>fire</i> for a long time and then turn aside, you will see <b>spots</b> before your eyes. Although nobody ever thought of such a thing before - as least as far as know, they didn't - imagine using those <b>spots</b> as a technique for <i>fortune-telling</i>. The old witch sits before her <i>cauldron</i> and watches the <b>spots</b> that show up when she turns to look at you, and from that <i>tells your fortune</i>. Think of it as a kind of <b>spot</b>-check on your future.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 27-7-2007(226): The FORTUNE TELLER was burned by FLAMES on the<strong> spot</strong> because she was accused of being a witch.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/etpan">etpan</a>] 12-6-2008(138): You have to stimulate the G-spot with your <em>magic wand</em> in order to get her on <em>fire</em>. Or you can juste use your <em>mouth</em>…</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/noushina">noushina</a>] 23-11-2012(33): The <em>Fortune Teller</em> stares into an <em>Campfire</em> until she sees <strong>SPOTS</strong>. She then interprets those<strong> spot</strong>s in the same manner than another fortune teller would look at tea leaves or the bumps on your head.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix">kaminix</a>] 2-3-2008(14): Alternate meaning of the kanji is <strong>mark</strong>, or <strong>points</strong>. Like japanese tests are graded from 0 to 100 depending on how many <strong>percent</strong> of the questions they got correct. Before I learned any alternate meaning to this I took it as <strong>percentage</strong> = statistics. Now, wouldn't some pure and concrete <strong>statistics</strong> be just the thing you need to set that <em>fortune tellers</em> mind on <em>fire</em>? Relate the setting him/her on fire to the entry for <a href="../v4/163.html">anxiety</a> (#163 煩) if it helps. :).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 29-3-2008(10): "Out damn<strong> spot</strong>!" Yelled the crazy <em>fortune teller</em> as she leaped into the <em>fire</em>. I guess thats not quite how it happened in Hamlet though, so I got a low <strong>mark</strong> on my English test.</p>
