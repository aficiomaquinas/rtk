<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 9-2-2007(55): The penalty for <strong>gouging out</strong> someone's eyes is to have your <em>fingers guillotined</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 20-12-2009(7): Before they <em>guillotine</em> him they<strong> gouge out</strong> his eyes with their <em>fingers</em>, which is why we can't see eyes in this Kanji.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 25-9-2010(3): Itchy and Scratchy. The mouses uses his fingers to pull out one of the cats eyes and then sets up a tiny guillotine to cut the cord connecting it to his brain. A very elaborate way of gouging out an eye. Bart would love it.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spleenlol">spleenlol</a>] 6-8-2010(1): Instead of putting Samson on the <em>guillotine</em> they decided to use their <em>fingers</em> and<strong> gouge out</strong> his eyes.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 29-2-2008(1): <em>Fingers, the thief</em>, has decided that, rather than have them <strong>gouge out</strong> his eyes, he'll go to the <em>guillotine</em> (they didn't give him the choice of drowning). Because it's <em>Fingers</em>, he must go to the <em>guillotine</em> or we <strong>gouge out</strong> his eye balls.</p>
