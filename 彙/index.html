<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 3-12-2008(42): I was having <em>mutual difficulties</em> in my relationship. She was always the one wearing the <em>crown</em> and I was the one picking the <em>fruit</em>. In order to fix the problem I checked the<strong> glossary</strong> for "<em>mutual difficulties</em>" but found nothing. I guess we're going to have to <em>mutually end</em> our relationship.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 12-3-2010(27): When I went to <em>Headless Mutual</em>, the bank for tough London gangsters, I was given a pamphlet that said "If you try'a rip us off, we'll give you the rough end of a pineapple." I didn't quite understand this phrase, but it was important that I knew my legal obligations, so I consulted my <strong>Glossary</strong> of British Thieves' Argot. The result: "'give one the rough end of a pineapple': lit. insert the <em>crown</em> of the <em>fruit</em> into the recipient's anus. Metaphorically used to mean 'to exact vengeance'. Oh, I see now.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brose">brose</a>] 2-4-2007(22): People who read the<strong> glossary</strong> are <em>mutually exclusive</em> (exclude the top line of <a href="../v4/757.html">mutually</a> (#757 互) ) from those who eat <em>crowned fruit</em> イ はりねずみ same kind 語彙 .</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 26-1-2009(9): I was reading a recipe book but had trouble figuring out what a "pineapple" was. Thanks to the <em>one-way assisting</em><strong> glossary</strong> at the end, I learnt that a pineapple was a <em>crowned fruit</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BladeWalker">BladeWalker</a>] 27-7-2012(8): We had no idea what a <em>crowned fruit</em> was so we <em>mutually</em> checked the<strong> glossary</strong>. Well, I say mutually, but really I did all the work.</p>
