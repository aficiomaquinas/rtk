    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>An uncommon, but not altogether unlikely picture of a reigning <b>sovereign</b> has him <i>standing up</i> in his <i>apron</i>, presumably at the behest of HIS <b>sovereign</b> (she who is to be obeyed), who needs help with washing the dishes.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 6-7-2006(254): The crazy<strong> sovereign</strong> stands up from his throne, wearing nothing but a crown and a towel. That's why they try to keep him locked up in the castle away from the public.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 16-2-2008(51): This one is so tricky for me. The key is to remember that the bottom stroke on the <em>standing</em> element takes those little crown "winglets" on the right and left. The most effective image might be of QEII (who is quite short) using her crown as a kind of stool. She's <em>standing</em> on her <em>crown</em> rummaging through a high cupboard looking for her <em>apron.</em> I guess the<strong> sovereign</strong>'s servants have the day off.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 31-3-2007(34): Imaging queen Elizabeth…england's<strong> SOVEREIGN</strong> as she STANDS at the sink doing dishes wearing nothing but an APRON.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 21-7-2009(15): The<strong> sovereign</strong> likes to make his female servants <em>stand</em> around in nothing but <em>aprons</em>. Can't say I blame him.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wisher">Wisher</a>] 31-8-2008(12): The first thing you need to be a<strong> SOVEREIGN</strong>, is to STAND TALL above your people and inspire them with confidence. The second would be to wear a cool CROWN. Third and most important, please wear underwear or at least a TOWEL to cover up you privates. People are going to be "looking up to you." (Inspired by WithLoveFromExIA's post).</p>
