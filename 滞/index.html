    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>People that have been &quot;<i>sashed</i>&quot; to something (whether their mother's apron strings or a particular job) for too long become like <i>water</i> that has stopped moving: they start to <b>stagnate</b>.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 1-12-2008(246): History of the first karate blackbelts: In those days, it was often difficult to find fresh, clean <em>water</em>, so samurai usually had to wash their <em>sashes</em> in <strong>stagnant</strong> puddles. The longer one had been studying martial arts, the older the sash on one's karate uniform and, therefore, the darker the color. So why weren't their karate uniforms black too? Never seen a ninja????</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jwy2k2">jwy2k2</a>] 20-3-2007(72): A moat is a<strong> stagnate</strong> ring of water like an obi (sash) of water tied around the castle.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stringy_cow">stringy_cow</a>] 1-1-2009(46): WATER that is "tied up" as if with a SASH and unable to flow properly will become<strong> stagnate</strong>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 20-12-2007(46): This is one I keep missing, and always because of the right-hand side. I can easily associate<strong> stagnate</strong> with <em>water</em> but never with <em>sash.</em> And so I will now try to associate<strong> stagnate</strong> with something around the house that often<strong> stagnate</strong>s and smells awful: the kitchen <em>washrag</em>. From washrag, I will make the association with <em>sash</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 14-10-2009(41): The <em>water</em> became<strong> stagnate</strong> because the drain was clogged with a <em>sash</em>.</p>
