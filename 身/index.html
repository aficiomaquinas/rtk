    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>The key word <b>somebody</b> was chosen to convey the double meaning of this kanji: body and person. Its composition is based on the <i>nose</i> (which, you will recall, is also the kanji for <i>oneself</i>). The extension of the bottom and far right strokes of that element, together with the unusual diagonal stroke, forms the pictograph of <b>somebody</b> with a prominent paunch.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 8-12-2006(230): <strong>Somebody</strong> was just looking for you. He had a long<em>nose</em> that reaches down below his mouth, and a long jaw that sticks out past his nose, and a scar across his face. (greenapple,16-3-2006) The way to remember that this is some<em>body</em> rather than <a href="../v4/1256.html">someone</a> (#1256 者) is that the story is full of <em>body</em> descriptions.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple">greenapple</a>] 16-3-2006(56): <strong>Somebody</strong> was just looking for you. He had a long nose that reaches down below his mouth, and a long jaw that sticks out past his nose, and a scar across his face.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 17-4-2007(28): Gang members sometimes mark themselves to show belonging, like by cutting their <em>nose</em> with a large <em>slash mark</em>. Why do they do it? To show that they are<strong> somebody</strong>. As a primitive, this character will mean <em>gang member</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 17-5-2008(15): <strong>Somebody</strong> with a stick pierced through their nose just came in here. I think they were from the Brazilian rainforest.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 16-6-2010(10): 身体 <a href="../v4/1248.html">somebody</a> (#1248 身) シン, み … Note: horrible keyword. Synonym for 体 … Parts: 自 , 丿 … Story:Though 体 has mostly the same meanings this one has more to do with the human body rather than the general idea of body. 車体 is a car body for instance. So <strong>Some one's Body</strong> might be a better keyword, so : 自分ノ body. … 熟語 : 独身 , 身長 , 身に着ける , 全身 , 変身 … cf: 発射 ,.</p>
