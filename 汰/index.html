    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>This character can mean both to <b>cleanse</b> and to make dirty. We will choose the latter and imagine someone who is displeasingly <i>plump</i> going to a skinny spa whose medicinal <i>waters</i> promise to <b>cleanse</b> him of his unwanted corpulence. Picture him sitting in the spa as the pounds melt away, leaving a greasy scum on top of the <i>water</i>.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 28-11-2008(71): I couldn't find any reference to this kanji as meaning<strong> cleanse</strong>. It seems to be most often used in the following compound 沙汰 （さた）to mean affair. The other meanings seem to be closer to 'select' so maybe Heisig meant<strong> cleanse</strong> in the ethnic sense here.. I'm going to use the keyword "selection", as in natural selection. Story: natural selection first began in the water, and those that were too plump were selected out.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 24-7-2009(27): <em>Water</em> is used to<strong> cleanse</strong> a <em>plump</em> man's colon.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brendanmacdonald">brendanmacdonald</a>] 29-9-2008(13): If you are FAT, it takes more WATER to<strong> CLEANSE</strong> you.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 27-4-2008(6): The <a href="../v4/120.html">plump</a> (#120 太) goes one a <strong>cleansing</strong> diet to restore his health. Each day he drinks his 3l of <em>water</em>, swim half a hour in <em>water</em>…</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 5-8-2009(4): The very plump man selected the Japanese toilet seat which will<strong> cleanse</strong> him with water automatically since he's too fat to reach back and wipe… (consider herman's explanation and think of "selection").</p>
