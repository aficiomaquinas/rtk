    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>Since you probably don't know what a <b>paulownia</b> <i>tree</i> is, we shall let the key word suggest the phrase &quot;the Little Brothers of St. <b>Paulownia.</b>&quot; It is a short step to associate the <i>tree</i> with the <i>monks</i> to its right. (For the curious, the name of this oriental <i>tree</i> really comes from a Russian princess, Anna Pavlovna.)</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 29-3-2007(371): In Japan, a<strong> paulownia</strong> (きり）is known as the "princess tree". It was once a traditional TREE planted at the SAME time as the birth of a daughter. It would grow fast enough that, at the time of her wedding, it could be used to make a dresser as a wedding present for her.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akira">akira</a>] 1-2-2007(98): <strong>Paulownia</strong> is a Japanese tree which looks same as any other tree.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zardoz73">zardoz73</a>] 8-2-2013(32): In the forest, there's a tree that my goofy friend PAUL claims he OWNS. I think he's nuts, because the tree looks the SAME as all the others.In Japan, a<strong> paulownia</strong> (きり）is known as the "princess tree".</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/totokan">totokan</a>] 6-11-2007(12): Also called Phoenix tree. After the wood is harvested the tree regenerates from its roots. The same tree comes up again.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gagge_tah">gagge_tah</a>] 13-8-2009(7): Paul owns the <em>same</em> <em>tree</em> as everyone else, a<strong> paulownia</strong>. // not every tree as in <a href="../v4/460.html">plum</a> (#460 梅).</p>
