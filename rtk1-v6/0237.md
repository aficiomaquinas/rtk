primit: "flower We are not yet equipped with all the pieces necessary to learn the character for flower, so shall have to content ourselves here with the first three strokes, which represent the primitive of the same meaning. Concentrate on the actual &quot;bloom&quot; of the flower, and keep a particular flower in mind. Try a rose, a tulip, or a daisy, since none of them will have their own kanji. [3]"
heisig: "Here we see a <i>flower</i> held in the <i>right</i> hand. You can imagine yourself in a magic garden where <i>flowers</i> picked with the <i>right</i> hand grant eternal <b>youth</b>; and those picked with the left, premature senility. Go ahead, pick one with each hand and watch what happens."
