heisig: "This kanji also uses the full form of <i>water</i>, though its meaning seems to have nothing at all to do with <i>water</i>. Remember what William Blake said about seeing &quot;infinity in a grain of sand and <b>eternity</b> in an hour&quot;? Well, reading this character from top to bottom, we see &quot;<b>eternity</b> in a <i>drop of water</i>.&quot;"

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lilpea">lilpea</a>] 3-8-2007(50): It takes but one <em>drop</em> from the most special <em>water</em>: the fountain of youth (and it is written in a special way to with an extra horizontal line on the top) to live for an<strong> eternity</strong>. (In order to remember that the drop is at the top, think that the drop must come from the topmost water in order for its effects to be true).
