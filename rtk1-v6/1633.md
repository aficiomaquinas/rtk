1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 25-6-2006(182): <a href="../v4/1513.html">land</a> (#1513 陸) The <em>rice-seedlings still stuck in the soil</em> gather <em>round</em> in a circle. Their combined <em>power</em><strong> forces</strong> them out of the ground at last.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thelooseteeth">thelooseteeth</a>] 17-10-2009(42): <em>Mushroom</em>...<em>Fat man</em>....= <em>Mario</em>. <em>Mario</em> jumps on top of Bowser&#039;s<strong> forces</strong>, crushing their evil <em>power</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 28-7-2006(37): The <em>fat</em> sumo-farmer<strong> forces</strong> <em>rice seedlings</em> into the <em>ground</em> with his huge <em>muscles</em>. With his combination of mass and strength, it&#039;s not suprising very few of the seedlings survive and he is <strong>forced</strong> to diet.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 19-11-2006(24): Looks like a physics formula to me: rate of time (rate of growth of <em>rice seedlings</em>) over the rate of (<em>ground</em>) distance <em>round</em>ed and multiplied by <em>power</em> gives you <strong>forces</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch">NeoGlitch</a>] 5-1-2012(20): <strong>Halfway</strong> the journey of 3030 kanji (both Heisig 一 &amp; 三 ), you watch the long road that lies ahead of you, and you start to feel down and overwhelmed... like if you were being swallowed by <em>quicksand - grounds</em>... but you soon realize that if you made it this far, you can keep going and eventually finish! You <em>round</em> up all the will-<em>force</em> UNDER your control, and get out of this rut! And just like you, our<strong> FORCES</strong> combined will let us finish this journey! <strong>Let&#039;s go users!!</strong>.
