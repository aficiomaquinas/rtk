5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Samchan">Samchan</a>] 18-2-2009(14): I liked wasurenaide&#039;s story, but the superfluous and wind bits just confused me, so changed it a bit: Remember the<strong> CROWN</strong> that kept falling off the kings big shiny bald head while he&#039;s making a long speech? Well now the king is saying &quot;i should have had the thing GLUED to my head from the BEGINNING&quot;.
