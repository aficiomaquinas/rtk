1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 5-9-2007(229): I have an<strong> inferiority</strong> complex because I have <em>fewer</em> <em>muscles</em> than everyone else at the gym. They all look like <em>Macho Man Randy Savage</em> (power) to me.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 4-5-2007(59): I had trouble remembering the relative position of the components, so now I use this story: Even <em>muscular</em> men have<strong> inferiority</strong> if they have <em>few</em> things above their <em>muscles</em> (i.e., brain cells).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 31-12-2006(43): I have an<strong> inferiority</strong> complex because I have <em>few muscles</em>! (Image: Arnold laughing at a weakling on the beach with few muscles).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 9-11-2008(10): If you like &#039;Heroes&#039;, then imagine Sylar having an<strong> inferiority</strong> complex, because he has a <em>few powers</em> less than Peter Petrelli.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cingold">cingold</a>] 11-9-2009(7): <strong>Inferiority</strong> is felt by those with <em>few muscles</em>.
