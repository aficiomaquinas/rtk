1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 16-5-2008(229): After I finish each<strong> chapter</strong> of RTK, I eat a piece of <em>fruit</em> to celebrate all the new <em>words</em> I&#039;ve learned. (Thanks Misha!).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 26-9-2007(135): <em>Words</em> signify the written words in a book. The <em>fruit</em> represents something whole, complete. A<strong> chapter</strong> in a book often offers a complete idea, setting, or account. It&#039;s good to disambiguate the keyword from <a href="../v4/82">paragraph</a> (#82 項). To reinforce the kanji, imagine eating a fruit at the end of each<strong> chapter</strong> of Tolstoy&#039;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; to reward yourself. (If you ate a fruit at the end of each paragraph, you&#039;d very quickly run out of fruit).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 12-9-2007(49): The <em>words</em> of each<strong> chapter</strong> bear a different <em>fruit</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSlakey">TheSlakey</a>] 12-12-2008(38): The first<strong> chapter</strong> of the Bible are <em>words</em> telling the story of <em>Adam and Eve</em> and how they ate the forbidden <em>fruit</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 5-10-2007(17): Here we think of the<strong> CHAPTER</strong> of the bible, namely<strong> CHAPTER</strong> three where you hear the lord SAY &quot;Who has eaten of the forbidden FRUIT?&quot; Goes well with the Naked frame that talks of the other forbidden FRUIT.
