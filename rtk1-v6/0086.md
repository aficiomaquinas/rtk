heisig: "To the right we see a <i>head</i> and to the left an element that means <i>craft</i>. When we think of a <b>paragraph</b>, we immediately think of a <i>heading</i> device to break a text into parts. (Think of the elaborate <i>heads</i> often seen at the start of medieval manuscripts and the task becomes easier still.) Just where and how to do it belongs to the writer's <i>craft</i>. Hence, we define <b>paragraphing</b> as the &quot;<i>heading craft</i>&quot; to remember this character."
