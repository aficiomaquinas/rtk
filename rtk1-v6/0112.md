heisig: "Here we have a simple pictograph of a person, taking up the space of an entire character and giving it the sense of <b>large</b>. It should not be too hard to locate the two legs and outstretched arms."
commen: "* As a primitive, we need a different meaning, since the element representing the human person will come up later. Therefore, this shape will become a <i>large dog</i> or, if you prefer, a <i>St. Bernard dog</i>. In frame 253 we will explain why this choice was made."
