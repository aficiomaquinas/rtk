1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 9-4-2007(169): <a href="../v4/1513.html">land</a> (#1513 陸) The <em>rice-seedlings</em> (newly freed from the ground but with <em>soil</em> still clinging to their roots) gather in a circle <em>around</em> an <em>oven fire</em>. They need to<strong> heat</strong> up prior to their journey (presumably plants can&#039;t walk if they&#039;re too cold?).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zanzibar">zanzibar</a>] 31-5-2009(57): <strong>Heat</strong> up those RICE SEEDLINGS you pulled from the SOIL in a ROUND pan over a low FLAME. (Note: the hot pan image helps reinforce the idea that this kanji for &quot;atsui&quot; refers to something hot to the touch, as opposed to hot weather).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 29-10-2009(34): This is <em>Mario</em> avoiding the <em>fire</em>&#039;s<strong> heat</strong>. <a href="http://retromedia.ign.com/retro/image/article/870/870378/super-mario-bros-20080429110134449_640w.jpg">http://retromedia.ign.com/retro/image/article/870/870378/super-mario-bros-20080429110134449_640w.jpg</a>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 10-5-2006(29): Just a comment on Erikkusan&#039;s story: Although one of the pronunciations of this kanji is &quot;atsui&quot; this isn&#039;t the atsui that you feel in Tokyo in August, (which is Frame 1260&#039;s &quot;sultry&#039; 暑 ). This atsui is the one when you touch something hot, like a fry pan. Another reading of this is &quot;netsu,&quot; which is the &quot;fever&quot; this fat man may feel after planting the rice seedlings.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 18-4-2010(7): (NB: The top of 熱 (埶) is a rare kanji meaning &quot;art&quot;. We already have <a href="../v4/1525.html">art</a> (#1525 術) so I call it <em>ARTISTRY</em>.) Keeping a primitive dwelling<strong> HEAT</strong>ed ain&#039;t easy! It requires much <em>ARTISTRY</em> to keep those <em>EMBERS</em> glowing. (I decompose <em>ARTISTRY</em> as <em>DIVOT</em> (坴) ... <em>ROUND</em>: Tiger Woods&#039; uncanny <em>ARTISTRY</em> for whacking <em>DIVOT</em>s as <em>ROUND</em> as golf balls. 坴 is a rare kanji meaning &quot;clod&quot;; we already have <a href="../v4/2024.html">clod</a> (#2024 塊) so I call it <em>DIVOT</em>; I see it pictographically: a golfer [above] whacking a divot [below].).
