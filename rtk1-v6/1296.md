1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 5-5-2008(311): Sending a<strong> facsimile</strong> to the <em>moon</em> can be problematic only a <em>quarter</em> of the <em>words</em> actually get there.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 15-1-2008(92): As a prank, a guy sits with his butt <em>flesh</em> on the<strong> facsimile</strong> machine, inserts a <em>quarter</em>, and tries to fax it to his boss. However the<strong> facsimile</strong> machine has pattern recognition technology and instead of an image of his <em>flesh</em>, it just transmits the <em>word</em> &quot;asshole&quot;. Don&#039;t forget it&#039;s flesh, not words, on the left side; the flesh image gets transformed into words.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narazumono">narazumono</a>] 7-12-2008(38): When you send a<strong> facsimile</strong> to the <em>moon</em> it costs a <em>quarter</em> per <em>word</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 4-12-2011(13): What used to take a <em>month</em> to re-scribe only a <em>quarter</em> of the <em>words</em>, the modern technology of a <strong>Xerox</strong> or even <strong>mimeograph</strong> or<strong> facsimile</strong> reproduces them them in moments.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 28-7-2007(12): It really is a quite acceptable <strong>fax</strong>. It&#039;s just in the <em>moon</em> light, you can only read a <em>quarter</em> of the <em>words</em>.
