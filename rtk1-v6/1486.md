1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rptb1">rptb1</a>] 11-11-2005(285): One sneaky farmer wanted to<strong> amass</strong> a large collection of livestock. We all know that cows like to eat flowers, so he planted lines of flowers leading to his own fields. The livestock followed the lines, eating the flowers one by one, and<strong> amass</strong>ed in his field.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 31-5-2011(21): To keep the difference between<strong> amass</strong> and <a href="../v4/559">gather</a> (#559 集) and <a href="../v4/1364">accumulate</a> (#1364 累), I emphasize the MASS. To<strong> amass</strong> MASSIVE <em>livestock</em>, always feed them <em>flowers</em>. They&#039;ll get nice and plump. 蓄え = たくわえ = store; reserve; stock; savings.
