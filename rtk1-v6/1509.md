1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 13-5-2006(206): I imagined some kind of initiation rite in old China, where every young <em>man</em> has to show his<strong> courage</strong>. They then receive a <em>chopseal</em> which is a mark of their<strong> courage</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 28-1-2008(76): Re: fuaburisu - The initiation rite in question is actually a reverse elbow chop to the <em>brain</em>, and you receive the <em>chop seal</em> if you have the <em>power</em> to withstand it. This initial imagery helps me with the altered <em>chop seal</em> and vertical placement.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 6-6-2008(62): A <strong>MA</strong> （マ） raises a <strong>man</strong> to have<strong> courage</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 20-4-2010(39): After showing sufficient<strong> courage</strong>, the young <em>male</em> gets a マ marked on their forehead with a hanko, to show they are now a マン.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shinyclef">shinyclef</a>] 4-6-2009(18): <strong>Note:</strong> Interesting kanji. It&#039;s actually not マ + 男 , but rather, this is an abbreviated form of 甬 + 力 , which gives it more of a meaning of &#039;path of power&#039; or &#039;run through with power&#039; or something like that. But if you don&#039;t care about the real origins and formation, either way of thinking of it works ^-^. (Source: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/oj4jes">http://tinyurl.com/oj4jes</a> + <a href="http://tinyurl.com/rcmnss">http://tinyurl.com/rcmnss</a>). <strong>Story:</strong> To have<strong> courage</strong> is to <em>run through</em> (甬) with <em>power</em>. When that happens, a マ becomes a man ( 男 ). (Thx Captal).
