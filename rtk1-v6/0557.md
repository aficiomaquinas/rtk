1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 6-9-2007(241): Bugs have to go to school to learn how to become <strong>lightning bugs</strong>. Only the brightest bugs graduate to become <strong>lightning bugs</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 15-2-2007(106): Q: Who&#039;s the smartest <em>insect</em> in <em>school</em>? A: The<strong> lightning-bug</strong>. Because he&#039;s so bright! (Image: lightning bug in school with glasses, pocket protector, etc. Maybe even have some cool kids teasing him).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 30-9-2008(29): In the <em>schoolhouse</em> for <em>insects</em>, the brightest are obviously the<strong> lightning-bug</strong>s.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 12-8-2008(16): Think of a small Japanese <em>Schoolhouse</em> in the country. The young children have caught some<strong> lightning-bug</strong>s in a jar and placed it next to window. Long after the children go home and the sun sets, the jar continues to illuminate the room. For me, this Kanji isn&#039;t about keywords, but a strong visual.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Davve">Davve</a>] 14-6-2006(14): Poor <em>schoolhouse</em>s can&#039;t afford electricity. As you can&#039;t teach in the dark the only solution is <strong>lightning-bug</strong>s! It&#039;s easy. Catch a thousand or so of them, bunch them together in a box and attach your wires to the box. Electricity flows through the wires as soon as the lightning starts flashing inside the box. Each bug has begun attacking it&#039;s neighbour with it&#039;s special weapon - the stinging rod of Lightning!
