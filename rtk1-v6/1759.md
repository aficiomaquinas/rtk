1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nmkohi">nmkohi</a>] 23-7-2006(233): Back in the day the people were so excited to get hold of the Sega<strong> genesis</strong> they looted the godown with sabers.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/imojyochu">imojyochu</a>] 17-12-2008(84): I prefer to have girls <em>Godown</em> on my <em>sabre</em> to prevent unwanted<strong> GENESIS</strong> of babies............ 創造 そうぞう (creation).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atylmo">atylmo</a>] 5-2-2009(51): The<strong> genesis</strong> of my hatred of kanji learning is when you get so mad that you have to look up what a <em>godown</em> is, and you end up cutting the book (or even Heisig himself) up with a <em>saber</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wakela">Wakela</a>] 24-3-2007(29): In the story of<strong> Genesis</strong> Adam and Even were kicked out of the Garden of Eden. They had to &quot;go down&quot; out of the garden and the entrace was guarded with sabers to prevent their return.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 5-6-2007(22): God actually has everything ever conceived in a big <em>godown</em>: if you want to exist, you have to grab a <em>sabre</em> and fight your way out. Such is<strong> genesis</strong>.
