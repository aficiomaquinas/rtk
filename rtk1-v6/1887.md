1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 30-6-2006(301): The <em>salad</em> did not look very appetizing... The <em>sprouts</em> were<strong> yellow</strong> and there were <em>animal legs</em> sticking out of it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thora">Thora</a>] 22-8-2007(48): I order a <em>salad</em> with <em>sprouts</em>. I&#039;m asked if I&#039;d like to add chicken. Yes please. My salad then arrives . . . . topped with these horribly gnarled<strong> yellow</strong> things. Chicken feet! (<em>animal legs</em>) ugh.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSlakey">TheSlakey</a>] 31-12-2008(36): My face turned<strong> yellow</strong> when I watched my salad sprout animal legs and start scurrying across the table. Check please!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Angrybeez">Angrybeez</a>] 24-6-2008(16): The salad goes<strong> yellow</strong> sprouts legs and runs off.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/GKKLJapan">GKKLJapan</a>] 18-7-2011(11): Anyone who&#039;s played Final Fantasy knows what a Chocobo is. Chocobos have<strong> YELLOW</strong> plumage and strong ANIMAL LEGS. They are also fond of eating SPROUTS, which has led to the promotion of various Chocobo SALADS.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 11-3-2009(6): If your <em>salad</em> is<strong> yellow</strong> and you still do not eat it or discard it, soon it will <em>sprout animal legs</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 8-12-2009(5): The<strong> yellow</strong> sauce (mustard) tastes good on anything. I put it on my <em>salad</em>, dip <em>sprouts</em> in it and use it to baste <em>animal legs</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 17-10-2005(5): In Pokemon<strong> Yellow</strong>, you can train pets and give them better <em>animal legs</em> (faster, stronger, ...) by feeding them with <em>salad</em> and <em>Brussel sprouts</em>. You may think of the kanji as a pictograph of the<strong> yellow</strong> critter.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rowdyphantom">rowdyphantom</a>] 18-1-2010(4): A bean <em>sprout salad</em>:<strong> yellow</strong> <em>sprouts</em> that look like a mess of little <em>animal legs</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 11-5-2006(3): In Japan, it seems especially important to have a variety of colors represented in your meals. Here we see a fresh SALAD, maybe including some carrots or tomatoes, adorned with some SPROUTS, and topped with a<strong> YELLOW</strong> honey-mustard dressing. What would be unusual in Japan, however, would be to serve ANIMAL LEGS with that beautiful SALAD.
