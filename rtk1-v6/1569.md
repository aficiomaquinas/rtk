primit: "silver We give this element the meaning of silver from the kanji in the following FRAME. Both the original pictographic representation and the primitive elements that make it up are more trouble to hunt out than they are worth. It is best simply to learn it as is. In doing so, take careful note of the stroke order, and also the fact that when this element appears on the left, the penultimate stroke is omitted, giving us simply ・. [6]"
heisig: "Metal . . . silver."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pauline">Pauline</a>] 3-7-2007(165): Like <em>gold</em>, <em>silver</em> is a <em>metal</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie">mhheie</a>] 23-1-2008(52): Not sure why Heisig find the right side so troublesome. My grandma&#039;s <em>hairpin</em> (just before <a href="../v4/1920">long</a> (#1920 長)) is made of<strong> silver</strong>, the metal that best reflects <em>sun</em> light. I&#039;m sure you can see the flash from her hair as she walks by on a sunny day. Note that the two elements (<em>sun</em> and <em>hairpin</em>) share not only a horizontal stroke, but also the left vertical one. Therefore a bit odd stroke order.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 21-1-2009(26): <em>Metal</em> that is<strong> silver</strong> is<strong> silver</strong>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 28-2-2009(20): <strong>Silver</strong> is almost as <a href="../v4/1468">good</a> (#1468 良) as gold, but not quite (one stroke missing).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nijuro">Nijuro</a>] 21-7-2010(10): In order of value, it goes: <em>gold</em>, then <em><strong>silver</strong></em>.
