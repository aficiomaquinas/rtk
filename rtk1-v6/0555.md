heisig: "<i>Water</i> . . . <i>scorpion</i>. It would be easy to slip into a &quot;lazy image&quot; in cases like this one, picturing, let us say, a <i>scorpion</i> near the <i>water</i>. But if you picture rather a <i>scorpion</i> letting its venom out <i>drop by drop</i> until it has made a whole <b>pond</b> of the stuff, the image is more likely to remain fixed."
