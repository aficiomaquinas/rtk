1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 8-5-2006(184): This more commonly means &quot;steal&quot;, like how a thief <em>cuts</em> a <em>hole</em> to steal the jewels.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 14-4-2008(97): The word<strong> STEALTH</strong> makes me instantly think of Solid Snake, who CUTS a HOLE in a cardboard box so he can peer out of it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 4-11-2007(66): <strong>Stealth</strong> bombers <em>cut holes</em> through the enemy radar.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 16-11-2008(53): I picture a<strong> stealth</strong>y thief cutting a round hole in the glass window to quietly unlock it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 19-9-2007(11): The new<strong> stealth</strong> bomber being developed by the US government is insane. Instead of flying under radar or disrupting it, it simply bypasses the whole thing. It <em>cuts</em> a <em>black hole</em> just above it with its nose, then disappears into it. Then it travels invisibly and instantly to its destination, then <em>cuts</em> another <em>black hole</em> into the sky and reappears. Only trouble is that they have to make sure not to enter or exit somewhere important - or they&#039;ll suck the whole place into the <em>black hole</em>.
