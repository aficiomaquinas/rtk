heisig: "To give someone the &quot;evil <i>eye</i>&quot; is to <b>stare</b> at them, wishing them evil. The roots of the superstition are old and almost universal throughout the cultures of the world. In this kanji, too, being <b>stared</b> at is depicted as an <i>eye</i> that <i>portends</i> evil."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 11-1-2006(140): Sauron&#039;s One fiery eye<strong> stare</strong> at Frodo and it is a sign of portent. Evil will become whomever the eye is staring upon.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne">sethimayne</a>] 13-11-2007(62): People<strong> stare</strong>d, <em>eyes</em> wide, at the girl in the bathing suit - she had extremely <em>hairy legs</em>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 13-11-2007(54): You lost a <strong>staring</strong> contest with a <em>turtle</em> because you blinked your <em>eye</em> before he did. (The contest wasn&#039;t fair, because turtles have nictitating membranes, and don&#039;t need to blink so often.) <em>Eye</em> comes first, because<strong> stare</strong> is most associated with eyes. And compare with <a href="../v4/658">challenge</a> (#658 挑) where this same obstreperous turtle <em>challenges</em> you to a finger wrestling contest. (Sibyl&#039;s story with some notes that helped me).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 18-12-2007(31): If you gave the sense &quot;a person&#039;s back&quot; to the primitive in <a href="../v4/235">portent</a> (#235 兆), you can easily discover an old-man <em>staring</em> at a good-looking girl: he doesn&#039;t apart his <em>eyes</em> from her <em>back</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix">kaminix</a>] 2-3-2008(27): Litterally this kanji reads &quot;<em>eye</em> of <em>portent</em>&quot;. Imagine an old lady <strong>starring</strong> into the crystal sphere trying to <em>portend</em> the future.
