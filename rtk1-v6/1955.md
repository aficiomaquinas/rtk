1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 25-11-2006(221): Did you know that you can<strong> unravel</strong> a cow? If you stick the dagger in at exactly the correct angle, the whole cow will just<strong> unravel</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop">richcoop</a>] 20-7-2009(77): <strong>Unravel</strong> the mystery by determining at what ANGLE the SWORD went into the COW.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 8-12-2007(38): I tossed the BOOMERANG, which stuck like a DAGGER into a COW that I targeted. Now I watched the COW&#039;s insides begin to<strong> UNRAVEL</strong> from the cut.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 29-4-2007(19): To <strong>unravel</strong> this mystery, you have to consider it from the right <em>angle</em>. Remember the most important clue: The <em>dagger</em> was found lodged in the stable above the <em>cow</em>&#039;s head! Once you see that <em>angle</em>, who would be able to place the <em>dagger</em> over the <em>cow</em>&#039;s head, the whole puzzle will <strong>unravel</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 25-7-2008(17): Think: Piñata. Specifically, one in the shape of a <em>cow</em> that will completely<strong> unravel</strong> if <em>stabbed</em> at just the right <em>angle</em>.
