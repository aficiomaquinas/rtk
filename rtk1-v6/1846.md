primit: "shape The three simple strokes of this element actually represent the form or shape of the hair of one’s beard. But we keep the simple sense of a shape, or its verb &quot;to shape,&quot; in order to avoid confusion later when we meet an element for hair. When using this element, be sure to visualize yourself shaping the thing in question, or better still, twisting it out of shape. [3]"
heisig: "The two primitives here, <i>circumference</i> and <i>shape</i>, belong naturally to the special connotations that differentiate <b>carving</b> from <i>engraving</i> (see frame 1639)."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 29-3-2007(187): Start with a <em>circumference</em> and<strong> carve</strong> away until you get the <em>shape</em> you want.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 18-12-2006(74): [My primitive for <em>shape</em> is Mystique, the shape-shifter from X-Men.] <em>Mystique</em> the shape-shifter<strong> carve</strong>s obscure markings around the <em>circumfrence</em> of her blue body.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 20-7-2008(65): (Primitive: <em>shape</em> - when you were three you played with <em>Play-Doh</em>.) 彫 : Did anyone else use the <em>circumference</em> of the <em>Play-Doh</em> container to<strong> carve</strong> circular <em>shapes</em>?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 25-4-2010(38): HINT: There are a lot of good stories on this website using Bruce Lee as a primitive for <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2008">sign of the dragon</a> (#2008 辰), so you may want to avoid using him for shape. Mystique works well, as suggested by ayoung24.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Uncreativity">Uncreativity</a>] 28-1-2010(15): HINT: To help me remember that 彡 leans the opposite way as ミ, I am calling that primitive <em>my evil twin</em>. It&#039;s <em>mi</em> from the mirror universe. You can also think of it as the three strokes of my evil twin&#039;s goatee. STORY: I know the witness saw me<strong> carve</strong> the entire <em>circumference</em> of the victim&#039;s skin, but it wasn&#039;t me, officer; it was <em>my evil twin</em>.
