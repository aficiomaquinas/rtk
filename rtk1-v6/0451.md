heisig: "This kanji, also a primitive, is one of the clearest instances we have of a complex pictograph. The top line is the sky, the next 3 strokes a pair of clouds, and the final 4 dots the <b>rain</b> collected there and waiting to fall."
commen: "* As a primitive it can mean either <i>rain</i> or <i>weather</i> in general. Because it takes so much space, it usually has to be contracted into a crown by shortening the second and third strokes into a crown."
