1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 16-2-2006(268): Coal mine (<em>cave</em>); tea break time; the <em>assembly line</em> stops and everyone<strong> sit</strong> or squat on the <em>dirt</em> floor, in a long line, to rest.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 28-8-2009(267): CONGRATULATIONS YOU&#039;RE HALFWAY THERE!!!! =).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 2-6-2006(72): Nice one Gorgon. I thought I would mention that the stroke order is non-standard here. With <em>soil</em> the vertical stroke comes first.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle">calittle</a>] 15-10-2007(37): While working on an <em>assembly line</em> in a <em>cave</em>, there no benches on which to<strong> sit</strong>, so everyone just <strong>sits</strong> on the <em>ground</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 26-5-2010(12): Tea break on the coal assembly line — Time to all<strong> sit</strong> in the dirt. (Coal mine is a cave of course :) You<strong> sit</strong> DOWN so the vertical downstroke of soil comes first! [---Thanks gorgon &amp; wrightak!].
