2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 25-2-2007(70): The <strong>plains</strong> are a challenging place to get any work done. Be sure you recharge your <em>computer&#039;s</em> battery <em>beforehand</em>, or you won&#039;t get anything done.

You ALL know what I&#039;m talking about. <a href="http://photos.codlib.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/bliss_xp.jpg">http://photos.codlib.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/bliss_xp.jpg</a> Now that I look at it on Vista, I actually realized how pretty this place really is.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 29-1-2008(18): Think of<strong> plains</strong> in contrast to hills, mountains, and skyscrapers. A saboteur breaks into the military <em>computer</em> complex. Wearing <em>gloves</em> to avoid leaving fingerprints, he types a few codes into the <em>computer</em> that unleash the nuclear weapons on the target city. The target city, formerly a varied landscape of hills, mountains, and skyscrapers, is instantly flattened into level and barren landscape:<strong> plains</strong>.
