1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 11-5-2008(136): Mr. T shows his<strong> humanity</strong> by giving <em>two</em> bucks to every homeless person he sees.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 21-12-2007(90): <strong>Warning</strong>: This is not<strong> humanity</strong> as in all the people. But rather the qualities that make us human such as compassion and benevolence.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 9-7-2008(51): This character, as Heisig points out, is strongly Confucian. Some scholars say that it references the importance of <strong>humane</strong> relationships between <em>two people</em> (parent/child, sibling/sibling, ruler/subject, etc). It&#039;s easy enough, though, to look at it as a person in a dialogue with another - the give and take, yin and yang - the <em>two</em>-way street in which<strong> humanity</strong> relates to each other.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 15-2-2006(22): <strong>Humanity</strong> began with <em>two people</em>, adam and eve.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrenaline">adrenaline</a>] 18-5-2009(15): <strong>Humanity</strong> needs only two things: CHUCK and NORRIS.
