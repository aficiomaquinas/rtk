Orange trees, apple trees, cantaloupe trees.<strong> Plum</strong>s are simply mutant fruits that have been installed in the root software of every single tree. I hear that some<strong> plum</strong>-loving scientists are working on a way to hack <em>every</em> <em>tree&#039;s</em> genetic code so that <em>every tree</em> will bear nothing _but_<strong> plum</strong>s.
