1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 19-7-2007(279): I was EMPLOYED to give HEAD...when I<strong> look back</strong>, maybe that was not a wise career move.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod">PacifistGod</a>] 13-4-2007(138): The people we employ are always turning their heads to<strong> look back</strong>. They don&#039;t want to be caught playing solitare on company time.
