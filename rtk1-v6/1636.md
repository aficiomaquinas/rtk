1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 11-4-2006(191): <a href="../v4/1513">land</a> (#1513 陸) However, the <em>pinnacle</em> that the <em>rice-seedlings</em> finally reach with the use of their <em>walking legs</em> turns out not to be the Promised Land after all, but simply a<strong> mausoleum</strong> (containing many dead rice-seedlings exhausted from previous quests?). Oh no!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 2-9-2007(61): On top of <em>The Pinnacle</em> is a <strong>masoleum</strong> for rice seedling farmers. They make an annual <em>walking</em> pilgrimage there.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bananarama">bananarama</a>] 2-3-2008(36): At the pinnicle is a mausolem. The ground is sown with rice seedings to stop the dead from rising on walking legs.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 29-10-2009(25): Every year, thousands <em>walk</em> up <em>The Pinnacle</em> to see the <em>Mushroom</em><strong> Mausoleum</strong>. It&#039;s shaped like a <em>mushroom</em>, surrounded by <em>mushrooms</em>, and supposedly Toad is enshrined inside (he died in a fiery Rainbow Road accident).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb">elmaestrokgb</a>] 31-10-2009(11): Ancient Japanese built a<strong> mausoleum</strong> for the &quot;unknown rice farmer&quot;. It&#039;s on the <em>pinnacle</em> of Mt. Fuji, and it has a statue of a guy with huge <em>walking legs</em> planting <em>rice seedlings</em> as he goes.
