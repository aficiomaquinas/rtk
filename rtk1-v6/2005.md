1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 10-6-2007(186): The<strong> empress</strong> is cruel. Normally she&#039;ll violently pull her servants by the ear when they&#039;ve failed to follow orders. But <em>one time</em> she <em>dragged</em> this one guy around the palace by the <em>mouth</em>. She must have been really angry—ever since that moment, he&#039;s never been seen again.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-9-2008(110): The <em>F</em> word often comes out of the <em>mouth</em> of the<strong> empress</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 1-10-2007(61): This is <em>ax</em> with the last stroke replaced by a <em>mouth</em>, thus forming a pictograph of someone about to have his <em>mouth</em> chopped off for spreading rumors about the<strong> empress</strong>. &quot;Off with his <em>mouth</em>!&quot; [Thanks raulir!].

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 5-8-2009(23): The<strong> empress</strong> can have you <em>dragged</em> out of the room with just <em>one</em> word from her <em>mouth</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 18-12-2008(22): We know the<strong> empress</strong> is really a <em>drag queen</em> because she only has <em>one mouth</em> Think about it….
