heisig: "<i>Soil</i> . . . <i>haystack</i> . . . <i>clams</i>. In order not to confuse this kanji with that for a <i>grave</i> (Frame 246), something like the image of an Egyptian <b>tomb</b> should be adopted, with all its special connotations."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stefanot">stefanot</a>] 10-2-2007(201): After the eruption all is a<strong> tomb</strong>. The soil has covered the remains of the farmers gathering <em>haystacks</em> and of the fisherman collecting <em>shells</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Soseki">Soseki</a>] 21-4-2008(97): Using <em>soil</em> and <em>hay</em> to make bricks, the Egyptians built the pyramids to <strong>entomb</strong> the Pharaohs along with all of their <em>money</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/libsrone">libsrone</a>] 30-5-2008(37): Depending on how much money you have, you can be buried in the hay, in the dirt, or in a<strong> tomb</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ezmoreldo">ezmoreldo</a>] 3-4-2008(26): An Egyptian<strong> tomb</strong> is soil molded in the shape of a giant haystack, with all the money of the pharoah burried underneith.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cheesemaster64">Cheesemaster64</a>] 26-1-2009(19): I think I&#039;m gonna puke. That <em>bearded clam</em> has so much dirt in it that it looks like a<strong> tomb</strong> rather than a womb.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomusan">tomusan</a>] 21-3-2008(9): We didn&#039;t have much <em>money</em> so the best<strong> tomb</strong> we could afford was a <em>muddy haystack</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 27-1-2012(8): Ancient pyramids were great<strong> tomb</strong>s on the <em>grounds</em>, like <em>haystacks</em> covering the <em>clams</em> of the pharaohs. (Note that a <a href="../v4/1198">tomb</a> (#1198 墳) can be buried in the <em>ground</em> but a <a href="../v4/1518">mausoleum</a> (#1518 陵) is never never in the <em>ground</em> and -- outside of Egypt -- is generally more elaborate, making it the <em>pinnalce</em> of<strong> tomb</strong>s).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 30-1-2008(5): The cheaper version of the pyramids. Dead pharao, add his shells/money to it, throw a large pile of dirt on top of it and as a finishing touch a haystack on top of the dirt. Now from far it looks like a golden pyramid and it doesnt takes so long to make it. But the first sand storm blew it away and a<strong> tomb</strong> raider stole the shells. They didn&#039;t want any of that so next time they build a real<strong> tomb</strong>: a descent pyramid with traps and everything.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 20-12-2007(5): From womb to our<strong> tomb</strong> in the <em>soil,</em> we must all pass the <em>bearded clam.</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/einahpets">einahpets</a>] 20-1-2012(4): This is an ancient<strong> tomb</strong> of a king or queen. You can tell because it&#039;s not just a mound of <em>dirt</em>. It&#039;s also covered with <em>ornaments</em> (the haystack-shell primitive).
