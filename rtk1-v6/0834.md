1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 30-4-2006(218): On the left, there are three mountains. The road <strong>branches off</strong> to each of them. (Note: This kanji is mostly used for branches in the road).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 5-12-2006(94): In a lot of Super Nintendo-era RPGs, there are <em>mountain</em> levels to get through. You view them from overhead, so you can see a mazelike path with many <em>branches</em>. Picture your sprite characters at one such fork in the mountain path, as it <strong>branches off</strong> in two directions.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(25): Mountain branches mean you branched off the mountain path. In other words, once you<strong> branch off</strong> from the mountain path you are going to have to hack your way through the branches.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kadano">kadano</a>] 24-3-2009(24): You want to avoid the mountain road, so you <strong>branch off</strong> to an easier path.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 22-11-2006(17): I just picture a tall mountain with many branches growing off its right-hand side. So many, that the mountain loses balance and falls on its side.
