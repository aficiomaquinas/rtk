primit: "receipt This primitive element is actually the mirror-image of that for stamp, but since Japanese does not permit a stroke to go to the left and bottom in one swoop, the visual similarity is not perfectly clear. If you play with the idea with pen and paper, its logic will become obvious. [3]"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/happychair">happychair</a>] 6-3-2006(218): Having decided to use SIGN OF THE HARE rather than RECEIPT and STAMP my mnemonic goes as follows: The<strong> WILLOW</strong> is the TREE that droops likes a HARE&#039;s ears.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 14-12-2007(106): A strange thing about the japanese<strong> willow</strong> tree is, it grows eggs... but the eggs have no yokes. weird eh?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 5-1-2008(51): I ordered a<strong> willow</strong> <em>tree</em> off Amazon but when it arrived it was covered in postage <em>stamps</em>. I try to peel them off but it ends up leaving a papery mess and cheapifies the<strong> willow</strong>&#039;s appearance. Luckily I kept a <em>receipt</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 16-5-2006(26): At the<strong> Willow</strong> Tree Nursery first you pick up your <em>tree</em> you can leave the lot when you show your <em>receipt</em> .. you also get a <em>stamp</em> for your next purchase.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kfmfe04">kfmfe04</a>] 28-9-2008(15): A<strong> willow</strong> <em>tree</em> looks like it has <em>receipts</em> and <em>stamps</em> hanging off it.
