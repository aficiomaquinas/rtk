1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 28-9-2006(302): <strong>Beforehand</strong>, this was a <em>halberd</em> but I cut it short so it could <strong>be for hand</strong> to hand combat.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 12-9-2006(126): Your <em>halberd</em> doesn&#039;t have a handguard? You should have thought of that<strong> beforehand</strong> (i.e., before you were missing your hand).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zwarte_kat">zwarte_kat</a>] 15-2-2009(25): This is the halberd<strong> beforehand</strong>, i mean: before you draw the hand (the last stroke of halberd).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 3-7-2010(9): Be sure to check your <em>halberd</em><strong> beforehand</strong> to make sure it&#039;s not missing its final stroke.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 10-12-2007(6): As others see it, think of<strong> BEFOREHAND</strong> with Forehand, which easily reminds you of a tennis racket for use as a primitive in later kanji. It even looks like a tennis racket, so all the better.
