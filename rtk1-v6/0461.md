2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 23-4-2007(125): The most<strong> attractive</strong> of <em>women</em> are said to resemble <em>angels</em>. Similarly, <em>angelic</em> <em>women</em> tend to be<strong> attractive</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/whistler11">whistler11</a>] 3-7-2006(40): Be careful not to confuse this with <em>exquisite</em> (women + few - frame [123]). I try to keep them distinct by remembering that all <em>women</em> <em>angels</em> are<strong> attractive</strong>, but few women are truly exquisite.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abbott">abbott</a>] 24-6-2008(21): <strong>Attractive</strong> <em>women</em> are usually no <em>angels</em>. On the contrary, they are usually quite bitchy.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 7-8-2009(13): Just because a <em>woman</em> is<strong> attractive</strong> doesn&#039;t mean she&#039;s an <em>angel</em>.
