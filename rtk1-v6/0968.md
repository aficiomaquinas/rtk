2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hilber">hilber</a>] 12-12-2009(114): A joke so bad as &quot;wheatashi wa&quot; deserves an elbow in the<strong> private</strong> parts.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 7-5-2008(82): I already know this as watashi, or &quot;I&quot;. In order to associate the keyword of<strong> private</strong>, I&#039;ll think of this one as &quot;Private I&quot;, like a detective.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 1-12-2005(43): I was glad that nobody was around when I stuck my <em>elbow</em> in my <em>cereal</em> bowl and spilled the whole damned mess all over myself. Something that stupid should remain<strong> private</strong> -- between &quot;me, myself, and I&quot;.
