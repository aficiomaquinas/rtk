heisig: "The sense of the key word <b>overgrown</b> is of something growing luxuriously, though not necessarily in excess - in this case a whole <i>parade</i> of weeds (outcast&nbsp;<i>flowers</i>). By way of exception, the <i>flowers</i> take their normal place over the enclosure."
primit: "parade(parada) Note first the order of the writing. The first stroke, added to fiesta, gives us a full-fledged enclosure, because of which we should always think of this as a parade of something or other, namely whatever is inside the enclosure. [5]"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 14-8-2007(189): The <em>gay parade</em> looks astonishing, as if<strong> overgrown</strong> with <em>flowers</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-8-2007(108): When your garden gets<strong> OVERGROWN</strong>, it&#039;s like the plants are mocking you. Here, you can see the roses actually parading around the yard, wilfully choking out the other, more docile plants. Then they actually go and parade down the street!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois">Francois</a>] 11-3-2008(90): At the flower parade, (hippies&#039; parade) all I can see is walking masses of<strong> overgrown</strong> hair!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 3-1-2010(40): It&#039;s important that the word<strong> overgrown</strong> leads to the elements, rather than have the elements lead to<strong> overgrown</strong> as I see too often in the other examples. So I turned one of the other stories around. STORY:<strong> OVERGROWN</strong> hair appears the most in a <em>FLOWER</em> power <em>PARADE</em> (of the hippies in the late 60&#039;s).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 3-10-2008(28): I use <em>scythe</em> as a primitive instead of <em>parade</em>. A <em>scythe</em> is like a <em>spear</em> (see [356]) whose tip has been bent to use for scything. When <em>flowers</em> have<strong> overgrown</strong> your front yard, use a <em>scythe</em> to cut them!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 13-6-2007(17): The Parade Grounds were<strong> overgrown</strong> with flowers.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 21-7-2009(10): Instead of Parade - Using &quot;SCYTHE&quot; because a SCYTHE is kinda like a spear but with a U shaped blade (the first stroke) added to the SPEAR. STORY: See my story for storehouse, I think of it as a section where weed is grown. Then cut off with a scythe for collection, production, and smoking. What plant grows thicker than weed after all? :) See 蔵 <a href="../v4/850">storehouse</a> (#850 蔵) and 臓 <a href="../v4/851">entrails</a> (#851 臓).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lizzie">Lizzie</a>] 4-6-2008(10): My flowers were so totally<strong> overgrown</strong> so the parade had to pass below them.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 18-8-2009(9): My neighbor&#039;s<strong> overgrown</strong> <em>flowers</em> are <em>parading</em> above the fence.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(4): The <em>gay parade</em> is <strong>overgrown</strong> with <em>flowers</em>. They sure are gay, those homosexuals! [Just kidding, but it&#039;s easy to remember like this ^^].
