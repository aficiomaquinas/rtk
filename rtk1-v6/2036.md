1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/danie115">danie115</a>] 21-11-2008(72): Sugoi! Sugoi! Ice Wife Sugoi!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 15-12-2006(48): His <em>wife</em> has a<strong> nifty</strong> way of making all types of <em>ice</em> cream in her home freezer.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 20-11-2008(40): I prefer keyword &quot;terrific&quot; for this as the Japanese meaning can be either &quot;great&quot; or &quot;dreadful&quot;. Story: freezing your wife is a terrific idea, she can still look pretty and you don&#039;t have to listen to all the nagging.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tuuli">tuuli</a>] 12-11-2008(28): A word like<strong> nifty</strong> makes you think of the 50&#039;s, and a <em>housewife</em> so impressed with the new <em>freeze</em>r that she says &quot;oh, how<strong> nifty</strong>!&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 8-7-2012(12): My <em>ice-cold wife</em> would beat me down if I ever insulted her, so I often tell her she&#039;s <strong>凄い</strong> (sugoi), which she takes to mean amazing but what I actually mean is dreadful. ------------------------- (I use すごい (sugoi) as a keyword because I already know it, but if you wanna use an English keyword, I like herman&#039;s suggestion of &quot;terrific.&quot;).
