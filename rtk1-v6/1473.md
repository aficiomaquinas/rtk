1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr">stehr</a>] 7-10-2007(188): <em>Spiderman</em> traps The Rhino under the <em>hood</em> of his famous<strong> netting</strong>, where even Rhino&#039;s <em>horns</em> can not break free, in fact if the<strong> netting</strong> did not dissappear after a few hours then Rhino might even <em>perish</em> in there.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 29-10-2006(76): You use a 糸 to make a net shaped like a hood. A stray animal got caught in it by its horns and perished.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 18-1-2008(54): Sadly, sometimes <strong>nettings</strong> have a <em>thread</em> so strong, the net gets caught like a <em>hood</em> on an animal&#039;s <em>horns</em>, and stays there until the poor thing <em>perishes</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 28-1-2007(26): Spider-woman dies of a mosquito bite. They replace the (ineffectual)<strong> netting</strong> over her bed with a glass canopy, and put a viking&#039;s horned helmet on her dead head, so she can lie in state with dignity.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tristanthorn">tristanthorn</a>] 14-4-2010(25): <em>Spiderman</em> caught The Rhino, under a <em>glass canopy</em>; instead of his usual webbed<strong> netting</strong>. But unfortunately, the <em>horned one perished</em>: he couldn&#039;t breathe. Next time spidey will stick to his traditional methods... (I prefer to say <em>horned one</em> rather than just <em>horned</em>, to remind myself of the extra stroke).
