heisig: "The character for <b>stop</b> is easiest to learn as a pictograph, though you have to take a moment to see it. Take it as a rather crude drawing of a footprint: the first 3 strokes represent the front of the foot and the last the heel. The big toe (stroke 2 sticking out to the right) on the right indicates that this is a left foot."
commen: "* Although the meaning of <i>stop</i> will be retained, we will return often to the pictographic meaning of <i>footprint</i>."

The final stroke is the road.
