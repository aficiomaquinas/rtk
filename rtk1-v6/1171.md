1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 15-1-2007(224): This recalls the selling of indulgences in the history of the Church (As an aside, Protestantism began as a protest of this practice). Basically, one gave <em>wealth</em> to the <em>altar</em> (i.e. priest) and received a <em>blessing</em>. If you prefer a Jewish version, think of the donation (<em>wealth</em>) that is expected when you&#039;re called to the ark (<em>altar</em> in the kanji) to give a<strong> blessing</strong> over the torah.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 19-6-2007(78): Put all your <em>wealth</em> on the church <em>altar</em> and receive one<strong> blessing</strong>. (You stand up out of your wheelchair or something.).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akaiYaMa">akaiYaMa</a>] 10-3-2009(52): Wow, this is Scientology put into a kanji. In the Scientology faith the <em>wealthiest</em> members have the highest status in the Church. So basically, the <em>wealthiest</em> person that puts the most money on the <em>alter</em> receives the most<strong> blessing</strong>s....(not really, from what I&#039;ve heard, the more money you give the better parking spot you get....).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RobMow">RobMow</a>] 8-9-2008(16): When you pray at the <em>altar</em> be sure to count your <em>wealth </em> as a<strong> blessing</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kadano">kadano</a>] 20-4-2009(11): This illustrates the idea of tithing... thankful for God&#039;s <strong>blessing</strong>s, you give back a tenth of the <em>wealth</em> He has given you at the <em>altar</em>.
