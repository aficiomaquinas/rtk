1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 17-12-2007(148): <strong>Warning:</strong> The left part is NOT the primitive <em>turtle</em>! The stroke order is different. Sometimes it will look exactly the same but not always depending on the font / style used to draw this character. Be sure to study the difference!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shadolite">shadolite</a>] 20-3-2008(122): In the<strong> north</strong>, the weather is so cold that people are often seen sitting back to back to preserve warmth.

My &#039;story&#039;: There are NO <em>turtles</em> at the <strong>North</strong> Pole. What looks like turtle-backs are actually Igloos, so small you can barely <em>sit</em> inside them.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63">ashman63</a>] 9-4-2008(11): People! this has nothing to do with turtles. The strokes are different. Don&#039;t use turtle in this story. Just stick to the people sitting back to back in the cold<strong> north</strong>.
