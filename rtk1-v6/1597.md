1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 9-5-2007(270): I&#039;m a lazy fisher, so I genetically engineered a <em>lily pad</em> with a <em>fishing hook at the stem</em> and a <em>mouth</em> to<strong> call</strong> me whenever it catches something.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 2-9-2007(69): I just follow the <strong>calls</strong> from the frogs <em>mouths</em> on the <em>lily pads</em> to <em>hook</em> them.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woodwojr">woodwojr</a>] 15-7-2008(62): The right portion of this character isn&#039;t a water lily at all; we will take it to be a <em>broken hand</em> (see how if you rotate the second and third strokes, you approach the appearance of the character for hand?). In this character, we see someone who is trapped with a <em>broken hand</em> opening their <em>mouth</em> to<strong> call</strong> for help.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 25-7-2008(29): Inspired by dingomick: &#039;Budd&#039; - &#039;weis&#039; - &#039;er&#039;<strong> call</strong> the frogs <em>mouths</em> from the <em>liliy pads</em>, working to get you <em>hooked</em> on beer. <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=f3mXaATLeRM">http://youtube.com/watch?v=f3mXaATLeRM</a>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 17-3-2008(17): Not really <em>even</em> and first and last strokes are a different stroke type. Frog with open <em>mouth</em><strong> call</strong>ing out as he slips off the <em>water-lily, bending it out of shape</em>.
