heisig: "The final stage of the seed is reached when the plant has reached its full growth (the <i>tree</i>) and comes to fruition, producing <b>fruit</b> full of new seeds that can return to the earth and start the process all over again. The main thing to notice here is the element for <i>brains</i> at the top, which might prove more helpful than <i>rice field</i> for creating an image. The writing, however, follows the order of a <i>sun</i> with a <i>tree</i> whose trunk runs through the <i>sun</i>."
