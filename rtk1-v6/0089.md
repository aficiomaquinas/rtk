heisig: "To the right we see the <i>dagger</i> and next to it the number <i>seven</i> whose primitive meaning we decided would be <i>diced</i> (Frame 7). It is hard to think of <b>cutting</b> anything with a knife without imagining one of those skillful Japanese chefs. Only let us say that he has had too much to drink at a party, grabs a <i>dagger</i> lying on the mantelpiece and starts <i>dicing</i> up everything insight, starting with the hors d'oeuvres and going on to the furniture and the carpets...."
