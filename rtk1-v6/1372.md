heisig: "<i>Mouth</i> . . . <i>mending</i>. Note that the last stroke of <i>mouth</i> and the first of <i>mending</i> overlap."
commen: "* As a primitive on the left, it is amended to something similar to <i>correct</i> in place of <i>mending</i>. Its meaning remains <i>leg</i>, but should be thought of as a <i>wooden leg</i> in order to avoid confusion with other similar elements, namely <i>human legs</i>, <i>animal legs</i>, and <i>walking legs</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 2-6-2007(218): Captain Ahab lost his<strong> leg</strong> to the great white whale&#039;s <em>mouth</em> and had to <em>mend</em> it with a peg<strong> leg</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 18-1-2008(86): I&#039;ll use my <em>mouth</em> to <em>mend</em> your<strong> leg</strong>, I&#039;ll kiss it all better :).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-3-2006(18): Tip : best avoid the generic image of a human<strong> leg</strong>, and use that of a <em>wooden<strong> leg</strong></em>. As a primitive, the image of a pirate can easily stand for the <em>wooden<strong> leg</strong></em>. As for this kanji, I think James Heisig provided a story, which worked well enough for me.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zwarte_kat">zwarte_kat</a>] 12-2-2009(8): I&#039;m gonna mend your mouth with my 3rd<strong> leg</strong> ;).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 5-1-2010(5): I picture Seamus, the peg-<strong>leg</strong> sailor from Family Guy. He only has a <em>mouth</em> and a bunch of <em>mended</em> limbs.
