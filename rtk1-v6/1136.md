1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 27-10-2006(235): [fence; wall; (kokuji)] A <strong>fence</strong> separates one <em>soil</em> from the other. On a large scale, large pieces of <em>soil</em>s in the world have a virtual <strong>fence</strong> called nation. Picture a world map where all countries have their <em>soil</em> with one color, their national <em>flag</em> as the legend and a <strong>fence</strong> on the borders... don&#039;t you think it looks like a giant <em>puzzle</em>?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 27-7-2007(96): Why the Earth has to be<strong> fence</strong>d off and flags used to represent each &quot;country&quot; is a puzzle to me - we&#039;re all just monkeys on a big rock spinning round the Sun!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adhmm">adhmm</a>] 19-5-2008(34): An Ikea<strong> fence</strong>: you want to seperate your soil from your neighbor&#039;s, so you go buy an Ikea<strong> fence</strong>. You start putting it together and it&#039;s like a puzzle, with little flags on top of each post.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 3-10-2007(28): What is the best way to <strong>fence</strong> this <em>soil</em>? If we mark possible locations with <em>flags</em> it may be easier to solve this <em>puzzle</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 11-10-2009(26): The <em>Earth</em> is<strong> fence</strong>d off with <em>flags</em> indicating different countries, forming a complex <em>puzzle</em> of lands. (thanks samuize).
