heisig: "<b>Pig iron</b> refers to iron in the crude form in which it emerges from the smelting furnaces. Of all the various forms <i>metal</i> can take, this one shows us <i>metal</i> <i>before</i> it has been refined. Imagine two photographs labeled &quot;<i>before</i>&quot; and &quot;after&quot; to show the process."
