heisig: "Recalling an image from frame 195, first see the <i>mouth</i> under the extraterrestrial's glass <i>hood</i>, and then the <i>mouth</i> under the <i>top hat</i> of one of his mates who has tried on the strange earthling's headgear only to find that it makes him look much, much <b>taller</b> than everyone else."
commen: "* As a primitive, this character keeps its sense of <i>tall</i> and its position at the top of other primitives, but its writing is abbreviated to the first 5 strokes."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 30-11-2007(149): Two little aliens in a trenchcoat and <em>top hat</em>, trying to look<strong> TALL</strong>. The bottom one, in the glass helmet, is under the coat. The top one has his top hat pulled down in disguise, so all you can see is his mouth.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 13-6-2008(82): Here we have TWO MOUTHS each wearing a different hat. The top one is wearing a TOP HAT which is know to be as a<strong> TALL</strong> hat. The bottom one is wearing a SPACE HELMET which is known as an EXPENSIVE hat. (this kanji means both).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton">atomiton</a>] 26-3-2010(34): Woody and Buzz-light year. Woody (in the cowboy <strong>hat</strong>) being<strong> Tall</strong>er than Buzz ( in the <strong>space helmet</strong>) both with big <em>mouths</em>. Thx Minlawc! (adjusted for clarity).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alunalun">Alunalun</a>] 14-5-2009(19): This is the classic two children trying to be<strong> tall</strong> enough to get on a fairground ride. The lower child hides under a <em>cover</em> while the upper child stands on his shoulders and talks like he&#039;s an adult. But they&#039;re still not<strong> tall</strong> enough! So the top child gets a <em>top hat</em> which j-u-s-t pokes above the &#039;you must be this<strong> tall</strong>&#039; line. (and they both have hungry <em>mouths</em> for eating candyfloss once the deception is complete).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yasser">Yasser</a>] 19-11-2008(12): A cowboy (here represented by a &quot;top hat&quot; revealing only his &quot;mouth&quot;) looks always<strong> tall</strong> against a ninja wrapped up in his &quot;hood&quot; that reveals only his &quot;mouth&quot;.
