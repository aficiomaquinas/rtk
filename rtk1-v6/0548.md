heisig: "<i>Water</i> . . . <i>nine</i> . . . <i>tree</i>. From those elements you must compose a plot for the key word, <b>dye</b>. Here, as elsewhere, any of the alternate meanings of the primitives may be used, provided they do not require a position other than that of the kanji in question."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/munia">munia</a>] 21-8-2008(210): To make this<strong> dye</strong>, I used <em>water</em> and the barks of <em>nine</em> different <em>tree</em>s.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 8-8-2007(108): The <em>baseball</em> team hangs their freshly <strong>dye</strong>d <em>dripping</em> jerseys at the top of a <em>tree</em> to dry.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penot">penot</a>] 23-9-2008(58): <strong>Dye</strong> is a <em>liquid</em> that has to be applied <em>nine</em> times to stain the <em>wood</em> below.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 18-9-2006(52): [dye; color; paint; stain; print] The most common <strong>dye</strong>s are <em>liquids</em> that come in <em>nine</em> colors (the 7 of the rainbow, plus white and black), and are extracted from <em>trees</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 17-1-2008(16): <strong>Dye</strong> a <em>tree</em> with the <em>liquid</em> in a lengthy <em>9</em>-step process. I always remember the <em>9</em> because so far it&#039;s the number I&#039;ve seen most used as a third primitive in kanji, especially with <em>tree</em>. For placement, just remember it&#039;s the <em>liquid</em> poured <em>9</em> times over the <em>tree</em>.
