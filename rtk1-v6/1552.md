1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 2-9-2007(165): Japanese festivals have <strong>drums</strong> so big, a <em>samurai</em> has to SIT (not stand) on a <em>table</em> to beat one with a tree <em>branch</em>! <a href="http://www.d2.dion.ne.jp/">http://www.d2.dion.ne.jp/</a>~hidafyh/furukawayh/gyouji/image/maturi03.jpg.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 20-2-2008(41): I really hate the primitive meaning of &quot;table&quot; for &quot;bean.&quot; I just use &quot;bean.&quot; Anyways, for the<strong> DRUM</strong> primitive, imagine a SAMURAI who beats on a<strong> DRUM</strong> with two chopsticks, and a BEAN skewered on each end of the chopstick to produce a better sound. And the obvious story is: &quot;DRUMing on a<strong> DRUM</strong> with a huge BRANCH&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sindhikara">sindhikara</a>] 4-1-2009(29): <em>Mr. Bean</em> tries to play<strong> drum</strong>s with <em>10</em> different <em>branches</em> he found on the ground.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSleeve">TheSleeve</a>] 6-11-2007(22): These SAMURAI, sitting at the TABLE and waiting for their food, grab some BRANCHES to begin<strong> DRUM</strong>MING a rhythm while they wait. (In fact, they stand on the table, removing the top stroke!).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 7-12-2009(15): A <em>drum</em> cannot<strong> drum</strong> without a stick. No stick? Use a <em>branch</em> instead. HINT: For<strong> drum</strong> primitive - Our samurai has eaten loads of beans and now his LOWER HALF (tummy full of beans) is bloated and stretched taut like a<strong> drum</strong>. We can see him tapping contentedly on his &quot;drum&quot;. In Japanese folklore, tanuki are believed to play music by<strong> drum</strong>ming &quot;ponpoko pon no pon&quot; on their tummies.
