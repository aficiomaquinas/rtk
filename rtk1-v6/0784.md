1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 29-4-2007(215): A pictograph of Wolverine&#039;s adamantium<strong> claw</strong>s.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(54): Pictograph, see book. * I prefer the primitive meaning of an eagle rather than vulture. Somehow vulture makes me think more about meat and dead corpses than<strong> claw</strong>s. An eagle however immediately brings to my mind the image of an eagle plunging into a stream catching fish in his<strong> claw</strong>s, or that of the great eagles rescuing Bilbo and his party in Jrr Tolkien&#039;s novel “Bilbo the Hobbit”.
