heisig: "<i style=&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;>Donburi</i> is a bowl of rice with eel or meat on it. The character is a pictograph, perhaps designed by someone who felt that the portion of meat he was served with his bowl of rice looked to be no more than a tiny <i>drop</i> in the <i>well</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 2-11-2007(65): A little one is eating a<strong> domburi</strong> while standing over, looking down into, a WELL. He drops it, and it falls down &amp; down until it looks like nothing more than a DROP, landing at the bottom of the well!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(24): I <em>drop</em> a<strong> domburi</strong> down into the <em>well</em> for the goblin living there.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enryu">enryu</a>] 4-9-2009(13): (thx mantixen) I DROP<strong> Domburi</strong> into the WELL to feed Sadako (Ring).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 5-11-2009(4): A <strong>donburi</strong> is rice bowl, with <em>drops</em> of food (other than rice) and garnish on top. The steep-sided shape of the typical <strong>donburi</strong> bowl is depicted in the kanji as a <em>well</em>, which is not a bad comparison.
