heisig: "Both the stretching out of the <i>walking legs</i> and the little bit of <i>wind</i> tucked in on the right suggest using one's legs to kick something out of the way, or <b>dispose</b> of it."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 16-5-2007(278): The best way to<strong> dispose</strong> of a nasty bit of wind is to let it go and use those walking legs to dissapear. Nobody will ever know it was you.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic">anthropic</a>] 12-7-2008(146): To <strong>dispose</strong> of rubbish you should <em>walk</em> it to the bin not throw it to the <em>wind</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 11-7-2007(65): Contrast this with <a href="../v4/655">discard</a> (#655 捨). Disposing of something implies a degree of care, whereas discarding something is generally careless. You want to associate this with a careful way to get rid of something. You throw a piece of garbage into the <em>wind</em> to get rid of it, but remember that you should<strong> dispose</strong> of it responsibly and your walking legs carry you off to fetch it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pete171">Pete171</a>] 23-9-2008(28): To <strong>dispose</strong> of something you can either kick it away with your <em>walking legs</em> or you can wait for the <em>wind</em> to blow it away.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NyahK">NyahK</a>] 2-1-2010(12): I thought to<strong> dispose</strong> of my <em>wind</em> secretly, but it appears I &#039;left&#039; a trail behind whilst <em>walking</em> away.
