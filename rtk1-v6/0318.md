heisig: "Both the stretching out of the <i>walking legs</i> and the little bit of <i>wind</i> tucked in on the right suggest using one's legs to kick something out of the way, or <b>dispose</b> of it."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 16-5-2007(278): The best way to<strong> dispose</strong> of a nasty bit of wind is to let it go and use those walking legs to dissapear. Nobody will ever know it was you.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic">anthropic</a>] 12-7-2008(146): To <strong>dispose</strong> of rubbish you should <em>walk</em> it to the bin not throw it to the <em>wind</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 11-7-2007(65): Contrast this with <a href="../v4/655">discard</a> (#655 捨). Disposing of something implies a degree of care, whereas discarding something is generally careless. You want to associate this with a careful way to get rid of something. You throw a piece of garbage into the <em>wind</em> to get rid of it, but remember that you should<strong> dispose</strong> of it responsibly and your walking legs carry you off to fetch it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pete171">Pete171</a>] 23-9-2008(28): To <strong>dispose</strong> of something you can either kick it away with your <em>walking legs</em> or you can wait for the <em>wind</em> to blow it away.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NyahK">NyahK</a>] 2-1-2010(12): I thought to<strong> dispose</strong> of my <em>wind</em> secretly, but it appears I &#039;left&#039; a trail behind whilst <em>walking</em> away.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb">elmaestrokgb</a>] 5-5-2009(9): David Beckham had to<strong> dispose</strong> of his coke can, so he wound up his <em>walking legs</em>, and kicked it into the <em>wind</em>, knowing it would land perfectly in the recycling bin. [note the front leg is stretched out under the wind].

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 1-7-2008(8): Lol i dont know why but i have a vivid image of my boss telling me to &quot;dispose of this paper&quot; so instead of going to the bin to throw it, i just WALK to the window and chuck it outside into the WIND, cause im too lazy to go to the bin.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(6): To <strong>dispose</strong> of something properly you should stretch those <em>walking legs</em> and throw it in the bin, not throw it into the <em>wind</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Monkeys_Spiders">Monkeys_Spiders</a>] 7-12-2009(6): Looking this kanji on josho.org, there are many meanings, and position is an important one, eg archaically 此処 （ここ） <a href="http://google.com/#q=、其処">、其処</a> （そこ）、ところ (about to do). So I picture a guy walking in the wind trying to find the right bin to<strong> dispose</strong> of something and his friend is shouting &quot;そこじゃないよ！あそこでもないよ！ここだよ！”　He replies &quot;どこ？”.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/steinar">steinar</a>] 30-8-2009(5): I finished Gone with the <em>Wind</em> yesterday. Didn&#039;t like it at all so I <em>walked</em> to the door and<strong> dispose</strong>d of it by <em>kicking</em> it out. The <em>wind</em> took care of the rest.
