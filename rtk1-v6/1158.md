1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shaydwyrm">shaydwyrm</a>] 18-7-2007(281): The<strong> shoulder</strong> is the best <em>part of the body</em> to bash a <em>door</em> open with (Don&#039;t ever try this. Use your foot).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 6-12-2007(108): The<strong> shoulder</strong> is <em>part of the body</em> you use to push through the noren in a <em>doorway</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 18-3-2012(5): My friend decided to act like superman and bust the <em>door</em> down with his<strong> shoulder</strong>. Needless to say, the end result was him crying and clutching the <em>flesh</em> of his tender<strong> shoulder</strong>.
