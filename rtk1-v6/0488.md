primit: "siesta(sjesta - midday nap) Conjure up the classic portrait of the Latin siesta: a muchacho sitting on the ground, propped up against some building, bound up from neck to ankles in a serape, one of those great, broadrimmed mariachi hats pulled down over his face, and the noonday sun beating down overhead. Always use the complete image, never simply the general sense of siesta. [8]"
heisig: "As you pass by the muchacho taking the <i>siesta</i>, he cries out that he is <b>thirsty</b> and asks for something to drink. So you turn the <i>water</i> hose on him."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wazzab">wazzab</a>] 10-3-2007(133): You awaken from your <em>siesta</em> because you feel extremely <strong>thirst</strong>y so you go looking for some <em>water</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey">onsen_monkey</a>] 23-9-2006(72): The muchacho taking his SIESTA cries out that he is<strong> THIRST</strong>Y. So you pull out a bottle of WATER and pretend you&#039;re going to give it to him...but then you dump it all on the ground before his eyes. HAHA, sucked in muchacho!!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 13-6-2007(36): This whole series is easy to me if you picture Cheech as the man taking the Siesta. &quot;He man, you gotta drinka water man? I am like so<strong> thirst</strong>y I could die man.&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibilchan">chibilchan</a>] 1-9-2009(22): If anyone is having difficulty creating stories with the primitive <em>siesta</em>, try changing it to <em>beggar</em> - a <em>beggar</em> sits in his box begging for food/money under a hot sun. I have used <em>beggar</em> as a primitive in several frames and it works like a charm. Here a <em>beggar</em> develops a deep<strong> thirst</strong> for <em>water</em> as he crouches in his box under the hot sun.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Bullwhip">Bullwhip</a>] 5-6-2008(18): Have some <em>water</em> before you take a <em>siesta</em>, or you will wake up<strong> thirst</strong>y!
