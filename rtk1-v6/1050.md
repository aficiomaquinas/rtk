heisig: "<i>Person</i> . . . <i>Buddhist temple</i>. The key word is deceptively modern, but the kanji is actually another way of writing &quot;samurai.&quot; Be careful not to confuse with <i>attend</i> (Frame 1033)."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 23-8-2007(139): <em>Mr. T</em> infiltrates the secret samurai <em>Buddhist temple</em> as a <strong>waiter</strong> with a tray of green tea. (Careful: <a href="../v4/960">attend</a> (#960 仕)).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thelooseteeth">thelooseteeth</a>] 1-3-2009(115): Remember the kanji for <strong>wait</strong>, 待 . Well, now we have a <strong>waiter</strong>, and he&#039;s dropped a dish. See: 侍 ! 待 <em>crash</em> 侍 .

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 25-10-2005(41): <em>Mister T</em> can do no meditation! So he is a<strong> waiter</strong> at the <em>Buddhist temple</em>, attending upon the zen monks, serving green tea, etc. (but mostly, he is annoying all the monks with the noise of his big gold chains).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 19-12-2008(19): I think its best if we derive this from 待 (wait). So the<strong> waiter</strong>, WAITS for the people to pick their order by holding the menu [extra stroke] in his hand. This clever keyword allows one to go from<strong> waiter</strong> -&gt; person that SERVES you. A samurai was bound by oath to SERVE their master etc etc, 侍女 【じじょ】 (n) lady attendant, maid, (P) 侍医 【じい】 (n) court physician, (P).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 8-12-2006(10): The A-team tries to disguise <strong>Mr. T</strong> as a <em>waiter</em>. It would have worked too, except that he was to go undercover at a <strong>Buddhist temple</strong>. &quot;I pity da foo sent me to a <strong>Buddhist temple</strong> dressed up like a <em>waiter</em>!&quot;.
