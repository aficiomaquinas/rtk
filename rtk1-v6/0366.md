1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 9-2-2006(207): The mnemonic &quot;words to seduce the masses&quot; was just too vague and I kept forgetting it. So now instead I picture a seductive female reading aloud the<strong> imperial edict</strong> to the masses, thus &quot;seducing&quot; the masses.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic">anthropic</a>] 12-8-2008(56): The emperor did not need an <strong>imperial edict</strong>; his <em>words</em> were more than enough to <em>seduce</em> Anakin to the dark side.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RachelleUdell">RachelleUdell</a>] 17-7-2008(31): The <em>WORDS</em> of an<strong> IMPERIAL EDICT</strong> are meant to <em>SEDUCE</em> the people and make them obey.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 24-1-2008(19): Palpatine&#039;s<strong> imperial edict</strong> is a propaganda <em>speech</em> to attempt to <em>seduce</em> the masses to the Dark Side. (If you need extra help to remember the <em>seduce</em> part, think about some sexy photos of Darth Vader being included in it as well. The resulting image should be seared into your mind forever.).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dusmar84">dusmar84</a>] 30-11-2009(13): The Patriot Act is the modern day version of an<strong> imperial edict</strong>. It uses a lot of fancy <em>words</em> to <em>seduce</em> people into giving up their freedoms.
