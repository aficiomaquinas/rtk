heisig: "When a tree has <i>not yet</i> finished growing, it produces fruit with a full <b>flavor</b>. When the official taster (the professional <i>mouth</i> to the left) determines that full flavor has been reached, the tree is pruned back so that it remains permanently <i>not yet</i> grown. A neat little agricultural trick and an easy to way see the sense of <b>flavor</b> hidden in this character."
