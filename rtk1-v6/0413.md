heisig: "Here we see two <i>parades</i> in competition, each trying to <b>surpass</b> the other by <i>running</i> at high speed from one town to the next. Note the little &quot;hook&quot; at the end of the first stroke of the element for <i>parade</i>. This is the ONLY time it appears like this in the kanji treated in this book."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 4-9-2007(223): The person in charge of <em>running</em> the <em>parade</em><strong> surpass</strong>ed all our expectations (by just a extra drop...).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 7-1-2008(102): The <em>parade</em> of <em>runners</em> are all trying to<strong> SURPASS</strong> each other - and they end up running all the way to <em>Vietnam</em> (note that this kanji is also used for the country of Vietnam).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hoolan">hoolan</a>] 2-3-2009(36): A RUNNER will always<strong> SURPASS</strong> a PARADE.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 16-6-2008(32): This kanji is read the same way as # 385 &quot;transcend.&quot; The difference is that this kanji talks about<strong> surpass</strong>ing or crossing over a mountain (or the like) while 385 is used when<strong> surpass</strong>ing or transcending a amount of money, an expectation, etc. STORY: Some punk kids dared one of their friends to PASS/SURPASS the PARADE. So the kid got a RUNNING start but slipped on a DROP of something and landed face first in front of the PARADE ruining it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 6-3-2010(13): To make the marathon more challenging for the runners, they made them try to out-<a href="../v4/384">run</a> (#384 走) a parade going down the same path. The runners must come out before the parade, and<strong> SURPASS</strong> it, to win a shopping spree at Mitsukoshi or a trip to Vietnam. Oddly, this is a kanji in Mitsukoshi Dept store ( 三越 ) and Vietnam ( 越 ).
