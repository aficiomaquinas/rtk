1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu">ruisu</a>] 14-11-2007(461): Stop | spooning | turkeys. Spoon<strong> female</strong>s.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 25-2-2007(124): To become feminine you must stop using a spoon to eat turkey and use a knife and fork like a proper lady.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-2-2008(50): Tip: <em>stop/footprint</em> + <em>spoon</em> : This combination of primitives appears seven times in Heisig, including as a separate character, which he names <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2043">this here</a> (#2043 此). REF: feminine/female (FRAME 563), <a href="../v4/1375.html">purple</a> (#1375 紫), <a href="../v4/2044.html">brushwood</a> (#2044 柴), <a href="../v4/2045.html">fort</a> (#2045 砦), <a href="../v4/2046.html">whit</a> (#2046 些), <a href="../v4/2047.html">beard</a> (#2047 髭).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 11-10-2005(43): Oh I love this one, it&#039;s so silly but fun to picture. Imagine a turkey walking in the snow (in the North pole for example) wearing spoons for snowshoes. Turkeys have small feet so they can use spoons as snowshoes, right ? Now you&#039;re looking down at the footprints left by the spoon-wearing turkey who is walking off in the distance, and you think to yourself that those footprints look feminine : curvy and slender.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 13-3-2008(21): Mother to daughter - &#039;You are not a 雌 （めす） <strong>female</strong> animal! Now <em>stop</em> <em>sitting on the ground</em> with those <em>turkeys</em>; its not <strong>feminine</strong>!&#039;-----------Building from Katsuo&#039;s tip about how (<em>stop spoon</em>) is used often and later becomes (FRAME 2043)=<em>This here</em>； used for the words ここ、これ＆この maybe we should imagine the daughter｀s name is <a href="http://google.com/#q=ここ＝此">ここ＝此</a> .
