1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 20-7-2007(56): On the <em>first day of the month</em>, all the salmon<strong> go upstream</strong>, up the <em>road</em>, to the mating grounds.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paasan">paasan</a>] 29-7-2010(22): You accidentally ran over and killed the holy <em>mountain goat</em> on the <em>road</em>. Frightened by the view of the dead <em>body</em> and to save your own <em>body</em> from the angry villagers, you decide to run away from your bloodstained vehicle, jump into the river, and <strong>go upstream</strong> to hide your tracks.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/manubear">manubear</a>] 10-8-2012(7): You decide to go salmon fishing, so you ride a <em>mountain goat</em> to the top of the <em>road</em>. Under the light of the <em>moon</em>, as it&#039;s illegal, you catch the salmon <strong>going upstream</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Puchatek">Puchatek</a>] 12-8-2011(5): In this kanji we see a <em>mountain goat</em> that decided to<strong> go upstream</strong> along a <em>road</em>, but for some reason it will only<strong> go upstream</strong> when the full <em>moon</em> is up. It&#039;s actually stubborn like a <em>mountain goat</em> about not going upstream along the <em>road</em> at any other period of time. The <em>road</em> itself is also very confused about this.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-7-2009(5): On the <em>first day of the month</em> the <em>road</em> to<strong> go upstream</strong> is opened for salmon fisherman.
