1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 18-4-2007(192): Remember those poor commoners huddled in groups of 20 in a cave? The only thing they had for a<strong> seat</strong> was some old toweling (while their lords could recline on luxurious couches).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epsilondelta">epsilondelta</a>] 14-12-2009(62): PRIMITIVE: <em>Cave</em> + <em>twenty</em> = <strong>Finnish sauna</strong> (instead of Heisig&#039;s &quot;caverns&quot;, which I&#039;d confuse with &quot;cave&quot;). STORY: You don&#039;t directly sit on the wooden<strong> seat</strong> in the <em>sauna</em> -- rather, you put a <em>towel</em> underneath.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikedough2">mikedough2</a>] 3-1-2008(49): You&#039;re tired from walking the tour at this <em>cavern</em> and there&#039;s no benches to sit down on, so you take a <em>towel</em> and sling it up into a hammock-like<strong> seat</strong> using the stalagmites. (Big no-no).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip">Ramchip</a>] 17-7-2008(36): You&#039;re in an onsen <em>cavern</em>, peeping at the pretty young girls wearing only a <em>towel</em>... when suddenly Chris Hansen appears. &quot;Please take a<strong> seat</strong>&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/b0ng0">b0ng0</a>] 2-2-2009(13): If you want to take a<strong> seat</strong> in the <em>caverns</em>, they&#039;re often pretty damp - best to lay down a <em>towel</em> first before getting a wet ass.
