heisig: "The <i>person</i> on the left is familiar. As for the right side, we may combine the <i>insect</i> with a <i>brain</i> (observe the writing) and a <i>belt</i> to create the <i>Talking Cricket</i> who served as Pinocchio's conscience. (<i>The belt</i> is there because he pulls it off to give unrepentant little Pinocchio a bit of &quot;strap&quot; now and again.)"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 23-4-2007(165): <em>Mr. T</em> <strong>accidentially</strong> stepped on <em>Jiminy Cricket</em> (a brainy insect, with a belt sort of sash to hold his &quot;conscience&quot; badge).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 20-7-2007(69): <em>Mr. T</em><strong> accidentally</strong> steps on <em>Jiminy Cricket</em>. // Primitive: right side: <em>Talking cricket</em> = <em>Jiminy Cricket</em>, a <em>brainy insect</em> with a <em>belt</em> to whip little kids who misbehave.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jrkester">jrkester</a>] 22-4-2009(33): <em>Mr. T</em><strong> accidentally</strong> the whole <em>Jiminy Cricket</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nakome">nakome</a>] 9-7-2008(30): 禺 is actually a kanji itself, albeit a rarely used one. Despite its several meanings, the most common seems to be a red-eyed, long-tailed, big-headed monkey. Since we already have a primitive that means monkey, I&#039;m going to call this one the <em>long-tailed, talking monkey</em> (borrowing from Heisig a little). STORY: After suffering a slow period of work, <em>Ace Ventura</em><strong> accidentally</strong> discovered the rare <em>long-tailed, talking monkey</em> and life has been good to him ever since.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/findus">findus</a>] 13-1-2009(12): <em>Mr. T</em> <strong>accidentally</strong> <em>Jiminy Cricket</em>.
