1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 21-5-2007(374): Be sure to put a <em>hole</em> in that ceramic <em>sheep</em> before you put it over the <em>fire</em>. Otherwise, it&#039;ll just explode in the<strong> kiln</strong>. (If you&#039;ve never done ceramics before, it&#039;s important that the object have a hole in it, or this really will happen.).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru">raseru</a>] 14-4-2008(34): You put the sheep in the hole of the<strong> kiln</strong> and turn on the flames.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kodorakun">kodorakun</a>] 14-7-2009(19): True story: when I was a kid if there were lambs born in the winter we&#039;d put them in a cardboard box and put them in the oven (on low!) to keep them warm. I guess this only really helps me out hehehe...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 3-1-2008(13): Oh Boy! A craft project indeed! Thru the <em>hole</em> in the top of the <strong>kiln</strong>, put in the <em>sheep</em> you sculpted from clay. Turn on the <em>fire</em> underneath and voila!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 25-1-2008(11): I kept forgetting the <em>sheep</em> in smithsonian&#039;s story, so just imagine the sound effects: &quot;Baaa...&quot; (bleating)/Baaam! (explosion).
