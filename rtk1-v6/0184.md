heisig: "To the story we have just made about <i>fish</i>, this kanji for the profession of <b>fishing</b> adds yet another element BEFORE the others: namely the <i>water</i>, where the fish was happily at home before being caught, disemboweled, and eaten. Be sure to get a clear image of the <i>water</i>&nbsp;when you put it all together."
