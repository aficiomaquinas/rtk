heisig: "Among the many things <i>water</i> is useful for is <b>extinguishing</b> fires, and that is just what we have here. First of all, take the <i>water</i> at the left as the <i>drops of water</i> that are used to depict <i>water</i> in general. In the best of all possible worlds, the most efficient way to <b>extinguish</b> a fire would be to see that each <i>drop of water</i> hits one <i>spark</i> of the conflagration. An unthinkable bit of utopian fire fighting, you say to yourself, but helpful for assigning this key word its primitives."
