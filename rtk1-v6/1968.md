1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 17-10-2007(61): A<strong> palisade</strong> is a &quot;fence of stakes especially for defense,&quot; usually the stakes are very strong, set closely together, and pointed on top. <em>Tome</em> can be seen as a pictograph of several close-set <em>wooden</em> stakes, braced by one horizontal bar.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Crowfoot">Crowfoot</a>] 12-4-2008(25): Before I build him a <em>wooden</em><strong> palisade</strong>, the mighty leader gives me a mighty <em>tome</em> on the subject.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 5-10-2010(6): I&#039;ll let the tome primitive refer to a spell book, in order to keep it distinct. In that case, this kanji shows me a <em>wooden</em> <strong>palisade</strong> under siege by a few mages, trying to demolish it with their spells from the <em>spell book</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/drwaltoa">drwaltoa</a>] 23-9-2011(4): A pallisade is made of wooden tree-trunks laid side by side like the pages of an ancient tome.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(3): <em>Wooden tomes</em> form<strong> palisade</strong>s at the library.
