heisig: "Learn this character by returning to frame 99 and the image given there. The only difference is that the &quot;arms&quot; have been left off (actually, only tucked inside). Thus a <i>child</i> with its arms wrapped up into the back-sack is the picture of a job successfully <b>completed</b>."
