1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(82): Your <em>father</em> uses his legs to stop himself from being put in a <em>metal</em><strong> cauldron</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 14-1-2008(37): Whilst on holiday, my <em>father</em> was captured by cannibals and put in a <em>metal</em><strong> cauldron</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 12-12-2010(16): 釜飯 , 茶釜 , 釜茹で , 電気釜 , お釜 , <a href="../v4/2332">cauldron</a> (#2332 釜) かま ... Parts: 父 + 金 ... Similars: 鬲<a href="../v4/39730">Unicode-0x9b32</a> (#39730 鬲), 鼎 <a href="../v4/2865">tripod</a> (#2865 鼎), 鍋 <a href="../v4/2757">pot</a> (#2757 鍋) ... Fun Fact: this is slang for butt; and because of that it has become the word for male homosexual/transvestites お釜 (Okama); Always hard to tell with these sorts of words, but it <em>seems</em> matter of fact, and not loaded with hate. So, when you are making stories about lowering <em>fathers into metal</em><strong> cauldron</strong>s....

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 12-7-2010(12): <em>Father</em> keeps his <em>gold</em> in a<strong> cauldron</strong> (he&#039;s a leprechaun).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 9-2-2007(5): Picture some witches around their<strong> cauldron</strong>. They are making a magic brew to bring back their long-departed father. It works, kind of. The<strong> cauldron</strong> turns into their <em>father</em>, but unfortunately it’s just a <em>metal</em> statue of him (prob because the<strong> cauldron</strong> was made out of metal too).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 12-5-2010(2): This is not just any<strong> CAULDRON</strong>. This is the <em>DADDY</em> of all<strong> CAULDRON</strong>s (<a href="http://snipurl.com/humongouscauldron">http://snipurl.com/humongouscauldron</a>), made of tons and tons of solid <em>METAL</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 1-9-2006(1): In some European pagan cultures,<strong> cauldron</strong>s are associated with the feminine, but in Japan apparently we have a<strong> cauldron</strong> that is <em>metal</em> symbolic for the <em>father</em> giving birth.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/donovann">donovann</a>] 18-5-2013(): Being the <em><strong>father</strong></em> of a young, <em><strong>golden</strong></em> maiden, Midas promptly went crazy and had her ex-daughter melted and turned into a <strong>CAULDRON</strong>. He took a bath 3 times every day in it. Issues.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiwiburner">kiwiburner</a>] 23-1-2013(): The<strong> cauldron</strong> is what my <em>father</em> slaved over when he prepared dinner, its <em>metal</em> steaming hot. It&#039;s not easy being brought up by a solo dad.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mirnkaya">mirnkaya</a>] 27-7-2012(): It&#039;s a well know fact that my <em>father</em> dons his top hat and mingles around (see <a href="../v4/1275">mingle</a> (#1275 交)). What&#039;s unknown to most people is that when his back, he messes up with his<strong> CAULDRON</strong> trying to turn simple metals into <em>gold</em>.
