1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 19-11-2007(126): This guy would rather use his <em>pup-tent</em> as a <em>house</em>, than sleep in the<strong> dormitory</strong>. So he effectively turned that <em>pup-tent</em> into a <em>house</em> by getting a postal address for it etc. (just to emphasize house).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 23-11-2006(62): All-male <strong>dormitories</strong> in Japan are really weird, and tend to have a little too much 男気 . Here is a trick they play where if they find that one dorm member has pitched a &quot;<em>pup tent</em>&quot; while sleeping, they make it into a <em>house</em> by putting a little roof on top of it -- complete with a lit cigarette for a chimney -- and wait for the &quot;fun&quot; to start (fun meaning...lighting their friend&#039;s genitals on fire).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mfistik">mfistik</a>] 18-9-2007(48): A<strong> dormitory</strong> room has the same characteristics of a pup tent, meaning that it&#039;s small and usually sleeps two people (you and your room mate), however you have an actual roof over your head.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 18-6-2009(37): To please gods and pass next exams you set a whole<strong> dormitory</strong> (<em>house</em>) afire. Wow! What a <em>sacred bonfire</em>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 22-2-2008(14): A<strong> DORMITORY</strong> HOUSE has all the same characteristics as a PUP TENT; smelly, old, cramped, etc.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 4-10-2009(9): When your <em>house</em> gets burnt down by a <em>bonfire</em> you&#039;re forced to move into a<strong> dormitory</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 11-3-2009(9): My college<strong> dormitory</strong> room was pretty small - essentially, a <em>pup tent</em> with a <em>roof</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuini">Tsuini</a>] 10-6-2012(8): Some idiot tried to create a <em>sacred bonfire</em> in my <em>house</em> the other day. Now i&#039;m forced to live in my college&#039;s<strong> dormitory</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 19-3-2008(5): I&#039;m picturing some <em>house</em>/dorm where the children from the<strong> dormitory</strong> are having a sleepover, telling scary stories in <em>pup tents</em> they made in the room for added effect.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 26-5-2010(3): The <strong>dormitories</strong> in uni were a real doghouse (pup-tent house?).
