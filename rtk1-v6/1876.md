4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 19-12-2007(23): [+mspertus] My friend is too afraid of loud noises, so while we go out to enjoy the <em>sparklers</em> and <em>fireworks</em> on New Years, he stays at home and watches everything on TV so he can have a<strong> vicarious</strong> experience. Just the sight of them freaks him out though, so he watches with the volume low and his <em>fingers</em> firmly planted in his <em>ears</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 3-12-2007(10): Old southern joke. It was a<strong> VICARIOUS</strong> situation, the man lights a firecracker (SPARKLES), then stuck his FINGER in his EARS to prepare for the boom. Sadly, he was still holding the firecracker.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Artemisk">Artemisk</a>] 9-8-2009(8): My son committed a crime, because he was too young I had to take the<strong> vicarious</strong> punishment for his deed.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 6-11-2010(5): Some people live<strong> vicarious</strong>ly, watching other people touch (<em>finger</em>) and hear (<em>ear</em>) everything. But it&#039;s not the same: it&#039;s like comparing <em>sparklers</em> to real fireworks. 摂社 せっしゃ auxiliary shrine; 摂る とる to have (lunch, etc.) to take (vitamins, etc.).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 19-8-2009(5): Whenever I hear the song<strong> Vicarious</strong> by Tool, I want to do that thing where you sway back and forth with a lighter. Unfortunately, the song really is too-fast paced and hard for that, so instead I put a <em>sparkler</em> behind each ear, and tap my <em>fingers</em> against my desk to the song.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 11-5-2009(5): (German) A steckt B die Finger in die Ohren (B <strong>nimmt </strong> also seine Finger <strong>in sich auf</strong>) damit dieser <strong>stellvertretend</strong> für A die <em>Wunderkerzen/Böller</em> anzünden kann.
