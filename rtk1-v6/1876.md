1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 13-7-2007(146): Now that I&#039;m a responsible adult, I have to get my<strong> vicarious</strong> thrills from watching stupid people put <em>sparklers</em> up to their <em>ears</em> and burn their <em>fingers</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 1-5-2007(128): I put my <em>fingers</em> in my <em>ears</em> to avoid going deaf while getting a<strong> vicarious</strong> thrill from watching kids light off <em>sparklers</em> and fireworks on Chinese New Year.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 24-2-2008(28): 摂る 【とる】 (v5r) to take something into the body; to absorb nourishment. 摂取 【せっしゅ】 (n,vs) (1) intake; absorption; adoption; (2) assimilation; (P) STORY: One way to TAKE IN SOME NOURISHMENT INTO THE BODY is to take your FINGER, dig around in your EAR, then eat whatever SPARKLY matter you may find.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 19-12-2007(23): [+mspertus] My friend is too afraid of loud noises, so while we go out to enjoy the <em>sparklers</em> and <em>fireworks</em> on New Years, he stays at home and watches everything on TV so he can have a<strong> vicarious</strong> experience. Just the sight of them freaks him out though, so he watches with the volume low and his <em>fingers</em> firmly planted in his <em>ears</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 3-12-2007(10): Old southern joke. It was a<strong> VICARIOUS</strong> situation, the man lights a firecracker (SPARKLES), then stuck his FINGER in his EARS to prepare for the boom. Sadly, he was still holding the firecracker.
