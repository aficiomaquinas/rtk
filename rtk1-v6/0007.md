heisig: "Note that the first stroke &quot;cuts&quot; through the second. This distinguishes <b>seven</b> from the character for <i>spoon</i>&nbsp;(Frame 476), in which the horizontal stroke stops short."
commen: "* As a primitive, this form takes on the meaning of <i>diced</i>, i.e., &quot;cut&quot; into little pieces, consistent both with the way the character is written and with its association with the kanji for <i>cut</i> to be learned in a later lesson (Frame 89)."
