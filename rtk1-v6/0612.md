primit: "Pegasus(pegaz) By combining the horse (giving a twist to its final stroke a bit to the left to keep the strokes from overlapping) with the turkey, we get a flying horse or Pegasus. Be sure not to confuse with the turkey house from FRAME 567 確. [11]"
heisig: "Again I cannot resist sharing my own associations. If you've ever seen Disney's animated interpretation of classical music, &quot;Fantasia,&quot; you will recall what was done there with Beethoven's &quot;Pastoral Symphony&quot; (the 6th), and the <i>flying horses</i> that figured in it. The mares are bathing in the stream and the stallions begin to gather. As dusk sets in, the <i>flying horses</i> all start <i>yawning</i> and pair off for the night: a perfectly <b>delightful</b> portrait of <b>delight</b>."
