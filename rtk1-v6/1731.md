1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 27-6-2006(217): If you want to get closer to the actual meaning, then I think that 腰 (こし) is more like the hips or the small of the back. After being sat down in the office too long, people often say <a href="http://google.com/#q=腰がいたい！">腰がいたい！</a> It&#039;s the <em>part of the body</em> that <em>needs</em> massaging.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 18-5-2009(202): To the puritans reading this site - please stop reporting stories that have anything to do with sex! Although (as wrightak said) this kanji really refers to the hips, Heisig clearly chose the keyword &#039;loins&#039; because it was anatomically close enough, and the primitives lent themselves to an easy-to-remember story. Just because you&#039;re all sexually repressed doesn&#039;t mean other people won&#039;t benefit from a story such as &quot;the <em>part of the body</em> people <em>need</em> more than any other are the<strong> loins</strong>&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 6-3-2007(51): My <strong>loins</strong> ache! They <em>need</em> some <em>flesh</em>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 9-7-2009(38): The <em>body part</em> that has more &quot;<em>needs</em>&quot; than any other is the<strong> loins</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 9-2-2008(15): <strong>Loin</strong> clothes cover up the <em>part of the body</em> that really <em>needs</em> to be covered up.
