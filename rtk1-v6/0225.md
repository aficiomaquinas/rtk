heisig: "The <b>tags</b> you see hanging on <i>trees</i> in public places in Japan are helpful to identify what sort of <i>trees</i> they are. Next time you see one, imagine the bit of wire that fixes the <b>tag</b> to the branch as a large <i>fishhook</i>. REALLY imagine it, illogical as it is, and you will never have trouble with this kanji again."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 31-7-2007(173): Botanists like to identify TREEs by HOOKing<strong> tag</strong>s on them.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 30-3-2007(69): Might be good to note that this is also the Kanji for &quot;Paper Money&quot; w/ the reading さつ ( <a href="midori://search?text=千円札＝">千円札＝</a> 1000 Yen paper bill)... It also takes on the meaning of Playing Card with the reading of ふだ as in 花札 (Hanafuda cards) or トランプの札 (&quot;trump&quot; playing cards). For the<strong> tag</strong> meaning I like to think of wooden<strong> tag</strong>s hung on hooks from trees... but for these other meanings I like to think of both paper money and playing cards as paper (tree) products with the ability to &quot;hook you in&quot; so to speak.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peepiceek">peepiceek</a>] 5-5-2008(20): In order to put a<strong> tag</strong> on a <em>tree</em> you need a <em>hook</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xxinde">xxinde</a>] 30-3-2010(12): A <strong>tag</strong> was <em>hook</em>ed on a <em>tree</em>. Since the<strong> tag</strong> was actually a banknote (さつ), it&#039;s no wonder that it&#039;s gone now and only the <em>hook</em> remains sticking out from a <em>tree</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/certain">certain</a>] 17-4-2006(9): A little piece of paper (wood) attached by a hook makes a<strong> TAG</strong>.
