Here we have <em>Mr. T.</em> who is so <em>hardened</em> (all the body workout he&#039;s had) that he became <strong>in-dividual</strong>, that is, in-divisible. &quot;I pity da foo who can be divided into smaller units.&quot;.

He appears on television, saying, &quot;Being an<strong> individual</strong> is <em>hard</em>! But you gotta do it! <em>Harden</em> yourself, and be<strong> individual</strong>!&quot;.
