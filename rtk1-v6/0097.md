heisig: "Remember the story about the &quot;Little Engine that <b>Could</b>&quot; when you hear this key word, and the rest is simple. See the determined little locomotive huffing and puffing up the mountain - &quot;I think I <b>can</b>, I think I <b>can</b>....&quot; - spitting railroad <i>spikes</i> out of its <i>mouth</i> as it chews up the line to the top."
