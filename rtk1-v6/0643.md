1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 11-10-2005(183): You are given a <em>speech</em> about some serious mistakes of yours, and you have to <em>endure</em> the whole thing, because all you can do is<strong> acknowledge</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet">sweetneet</a>] 11-6-2006(142): I never read the &quot;acknowledgements&quot; section of books or theses, because they are mostly just boring <em>words</em> that i must <em>endure</em> reading, before i can get to the interesting part. :).

Imagine the consequences if, while raiding an enemy castle, one stupid <em>ninja</em> chose to<strong> acknowledge</strong> another by <em>saying</em>, &quot;HELLO!!&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 9-12-2008(33): In Japan, people who make efforts to <em>endure</em> (gaman) can expect to receive <em>words</em> of<strong> acknowledge</strong>ment at some point. The ability to <em>endure</em> is so valued and respected in Japan that <strong>acknowlegement</strong> of some sort is virtually inevitable.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Medeo">Medeo</a>] 19-6-2009(25): Some Oscar winners go on far too long with their acceptance speech. But we are expected to politely ENDURE their endless stream of WORDS as they<strong> acknowledge</strong> their colleagues and loved ones.
