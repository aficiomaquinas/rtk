1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 26-2-2008(176): This kanji is used commonly as a <strong>counter for small animals</strong>. This is a pictograph of a SMALL ANIMAL&#039;S view from inside a CARDBOARD BOX looking out at his masters HUMAN LEGS. He&#039;s probably hiding so the master does not COUNT him with the other animals which will probably be eaten (thus he avoids everyones<strong> EQUAL</strong> fate on the farm: the kitchen table).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 21-7-2008(97): Put a <em>box</em> over everyone&#039;s heads, letting only the <em>legs</em> show, and we all look pretty much<strong> equal</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 30-6-2006(58): Imagine a magician doing that trick where he puts his assistant in a <em>box</em> and proceeds to saw her in half. Don’t the <em>human legs</em> sticking horizontally out of the <em>box</em> remind you of an<strong> equal</strong> sign?
