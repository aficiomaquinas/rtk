1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 9-2-2007(211): A truly gruesome<strong> profession</strong>: an abattoir worker. Where the carcasses are <em>upside down in a row</em> that have <em>not yet</em> been cut up into sausages and steaks.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 9-12-2006(54): My<strong> profession</strong> is taking unfinished rowboats and waterproofing them. Customers come in all the time asking if I&#039;ve finished, and I point to their <em>upside-down rowboat</em>, still wet with sealant, and say, &quot;<em>not yet</em>&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 18-3-2009(29): The oldest<strong> profession</strong>: prostitution. I was once in a brothel in Amsterdam where the working girls had a group of businessmen blindfolded and hanging <em>upside down in a row</em>, <em>not yet</em> spanked and whipped, but waiting eagerly.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/testoman">testoman</a>] 4-9-2008(20): My life is ruined. All my <strong>business</strong>es went <em>upside down in a row</em>. I&#039;m <em>not yet</em> ready to change<strong> profession</strong>s though.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 28-10-2006(17): Taking this <em>upside down in a row</em> world and placing it upright is a<strong> profession</strong> that this world is <em>not yet</em> ready for.
