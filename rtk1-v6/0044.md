heisig: "We speak of &quot;<b>round</b> numbers,&quot; or &quot;<b>rounding</b> a number off,&quot; meaning to add an insignificant amount to bring it to the nearest 10. For instance, if you add just a wee bit, the tiniest <i>drop</i>, to <i>nine</i>, you end up with a <b>round</b> number."
primit: "As a primitive, this element takes the meaning of a FAT MAN. Think of a grotesquely FAT MAN whose paunch so covers the plate that he is always getting hit by the pitch. Hence a round baseball player becomes a fat man. SIMPLE Nine plus a drop rounds it off to ten!"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akimoto">akimoto</a>] 20-6-2006(235): Nine plus a drop<strong> round</strong>s it off to ten!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 16-8-2007(97): Watch out for <a href="../v4/120">plump</a> (#120 太). Here Heisig could have added a &quot;t&quot; and we would have had a much better keyword : <strong>rotund</strong>. <strong>Rotund</strong> is more specific than &quot;round&quot; which begs for confusion with <a href="../v4/1811">circle</a> (#1811 円). A dictionary search on &quot;fat&quot; or &quot;round&quot; doesn&#039;t yield this kanji, but &quot;rotund&quot; does! Primitive suggestion: the <em>Laughing Buddha</em> is often depicted as a <strong>rotund</strong>, smiling bald man in robes with a largely exposed pot belly stomach (symbolizing plenitude).
