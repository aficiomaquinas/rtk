heisig: "By combining the primitive and the kanji of the last two frames and reading the results, we get: <i>by one's side</i> . . . <i>craft</i>. Conveniently, the <b>left</b> has traditionally been considered the &quot;sinister&quot; <i>side</i>, where dark and occult <i>crafts</i> are cultivated. Note how the second stroke droops over to the <b>left</b> and is longer than the first."

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 26-5-2010(49): <strong>FOR THOSE ABOUT TO PUZZLE OVER THE CHANGING STROKE ORDER, IT&#039;S THIS SIMPLE:</strong> Look at the second primitive! Here, the first stroke of <em>by one&#039;s side</em> should match the first stroke of <em>craft</em> so that the stroke direction alternates in writing. So 左 is written horizontal, vertical, horizontal... 右 is written vertical, horizontal, vertical... 有 is vertical, horizontal, vertical... etc. (The ONLY exception to this rule comes with elbow [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/743">masculine/male</a> (#743 雄) 雄 ], which is written horizontal, vertical, vertical(ish)...).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paulk">paulk</a>] 29-7-2007(24): Sinister craft is done with the<strong> left</strong> hand.
