1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(91): The <em>sun</em>&#039;s <em>love</em> is<strong> equivocal</strong>: it warms yet burns us.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 17-9-2010(21): Inspired by haabaato: You confess your <em>love</em> under the <em>sun</em>, but the girl runs away. Her response is <strong>unclear</strong> to you (Using the supplement&#039;s keyword).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 18-1-2011(16): In RTK1 Supplement as &quot;unclear.&quot; His feelings about her were <strong>equivocal/unclear,</strong> so she spent all <em>day</em> playing &quot;<em>loves</em> me, loves me not.&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/haabaato">haabaato</a>] 13-3-2008(13): <a href="http://google.com/#q=曖昧。">曖昧。</a> On a <em>sunny</em> day, a guy professes his <em>love</em> to a girl he admires. But she gives him the common<strong> equivocal</strong> response, &quot;Let&#039;s just be friends.&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 10-11-2010(5): (Thanks HaaBaato) <a href="http://google.com/#q=曖昧。">曖昧。</a> On a <em>sunny</em> day, a guy professes his <em>love</em> to a girl he admires. However, while he&#039;s down on one knee, the sun comes out from behind a cloud and blinds him. The girl takes her opportunity, gives him the common<strong> equivocal</strong> response, &quot;Let&#039;s just be friends,&quot; and runs away while the poor guy is still blinded.
