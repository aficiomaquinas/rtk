heisig: "This kanji and primitive refers to the <i>part of the body</i> composed of the bones and their joints. The top part of the kanji, terminating in the element for <i>crown</i>, is a pictograph of a bone joint. I leave it to you to put the pieces together, so to speak."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 1-6-2006(145): Your body <em>meat</em> is attached to the <em>bone joints</em> of your<strong> skeleton</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 27-11-2009(105): The top box 口 is the skull and the brain 田 has shriveled to the size of marble (but following kanji convention it is depicted as a square) and rolled into the bottom right hand corner. With all the hair and flesh gone the crown has slipped down to the shoulders like a necklace. 月 represents the rest of the body of the<strong> skeleton</strong>. [Idea for position of crown thanks to n1williams].

The crown primitive depicts a glowing power field that goes from the top of this head down to the floor, progressively revealing his <em>skeleton</em>. Now, it&#039;s at the position of his shoulders, so everything below it is still <em>flesh</em>.

Since his<strong> SKELETON</strong> has no hair, ears, etc, the CROWN has slipped down past several bone JOINTS and rests amid other PARTS OF his BODY.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 26-6-2007(22): Imagine a<strong> skeleton</strong> wearing a <em>crown</em> and with <em>flesh</em> on just its <em>bone joints</em>. What a strange<strong> skeleton</strong>...
