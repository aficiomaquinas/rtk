heisig: "On the left we see a <i>vehicle</i> used for <b>transport</b>. On the right, we see a new tangle of elements that need sorting out. The first three strokes, you will remember, are the primitive for <i>meeting</i>. Below it we see the elements for <i>flesh</i> and <i>saber</i>, which combine to create a compound element for a <i>butcher</i> and his trade. Together they give us the image of a &quot;trucker's convoy.&quot;"
