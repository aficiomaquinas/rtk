heisig: "You may keep the whole range of connotations for this keyword, <b>car</b>, provided it does not interfere with the pictograph. Look for the front and back wheels (the first and last horizontal strokes) and the seat in the carriage in the middle. As an exercise, try to isolate the primitives on your own and make a story out of them."
commen: "* <i>Car</i>, <i>cart</i>, <i>wagon</i>, and <i>vehicle</i> may all be used as primitive meanings."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Twentytw0">Twentytw0</a>] 19-7-2007(151): My<strong> car</strong> is so fast it can go through ten rice fields in ten minutes.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saranich">saranich</a>] 20-1-2006(17): Actually, this is a 10x10<strong> car</strong> that can get you through a rice field.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 23-12-2007(15): Rather than hobbling along with a <em>walking stick</em> to cross through a <em>span</em>, it&#039;s much better to use a<strong> car</strong>. (Imagine an old man with a <em>walking stick</em> creeping along a <em>span</em> of road, and you, in a<strong> car</strong>, whizzing right by him. It&#039;s funny &#039;cause it&#039;s true.) Also, it&#039;s important to include the word &quot;through,&quot; so you know the <em>walking stick</em> goes right THROUGH the <em>span</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hotsw4p">hotsw4p</a>] 21-12-2009(12): The travelling <em>time span</em> is <em>cut in half</em> if going by<strong> car</strong>. / The<strong> car</strong> allows you to <em>cut your travelling time span by half</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nycity">nycity</a>] 2-5-2007(8): My<strong> car</strong> cost me the equivalent of 10 rice fields .. 10!!
