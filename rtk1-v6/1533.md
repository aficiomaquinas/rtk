1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36">laner36</a>] 21-11-2007(202): To me, this looks like a pictograph of a road leading to the big city (see the buildings?) where there are plenty of places to be<strong> entertain</strong>ed. Unfortunately in this city, every store is the <em>same: staples</em>. What <em>tools</em>! [ayoung24].

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shizuru">Shizuru</a>] 27-8-2007(90): Photographically, this kanji simply looks like a set of two speakers (the staples primitives) between the sub-woofer (primitive for same) -- all this as a tool to<strong> entertain</strong> a group of drunks at a club.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aphasiac">aphasiac</a>] 9-9-2010(39): Wacky Japanese TV <strong>entertain</strong>-ment show: a <em>monk</em> is <em>stapled</em> to the wall on both sides with huge <em>staples</em>, whilst contestants throw <em>tools</em> at his face.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 12-12-2008(34): This is a pictograph an <strong>entertainment</strong> system (two speakers left and right of the main unit, which has a CD slot and a tape deck) on a table-top.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 23-9-2008(24): Whenever I go to <em>Staples</em> I end up looking at the <em>same tools</em> every time (PDAs, printers, etc.) but it manages to<strong> entertain</strong> me.
