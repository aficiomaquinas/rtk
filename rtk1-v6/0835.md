1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 24-10-2006(215): Heisig mentions at kanjiclinic.com that he wishes he&#039;d chosen <strong>mountain pass</strong> for this keyword as it&#039;s closer to what the word means. If we do this, the kanji makes complete sense because a <strong>mountain pass</strong> is just <em>below</em> the <em>mountain</em> <em>top</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 22-1-2006(76): To the north of Lorien lies the Misty Mountains, and below their towering peaks are the Mines of Moria. The Fellowship of the Ring first tried for the<strong> MOUNTAIN PASS</strong> that goes above, but were halted by the wizardry of Saruman at Caradhras, and so are forced to take the<strong> MOUNTAIN PASS</strong> that goes below, through the mountain - a path long feared by Gandalf for the ancient evil that lurks there. Note : the kanji does in fact refer to a &quot;mountain pass&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 5-12-2006(31): The place on the <em>mountain</em> where you stand <em>above</em> and look <em>down</em> upon all creation is the mountain peak.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy">howdycowdy</a>] 10-4-2008(24): You&#039;re stuck. You look <em>up</em> and see only <em>mountain</em>. You look <em>down</em> and see only <em>mountain</em>. How the hell do you get out of here? Oh, there&#039;s a<strong> MOUNTAIN PASS</strong>. Thank God!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Izumo">Izumo</a>] 31-3-2010(19): The<strong> MOUNTAIN PASS</strong> helps you go <em>up</em> and <em>down</em> the <em>mountain</em>.
