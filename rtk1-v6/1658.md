1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 22-2-2006(378): Sun and blue sky! Yep, the weather&#039;s cleared up!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau23">dilandau23</a>] 1-4-2007(25): When we speak of <strong>clearing up</strong> we easily think of both the <em>sun</em> and <em>blue</em> skies. But in another since to<strong> clear up</strong> is the absence of weather. And therefor the reason weather has no place in its writing.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andresito">andresito</a>] 17-5-2009(17): The sky <strong>cleared up</strong> and we have a <em>sunny blue day</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 10-2-2008(9): Its clear weather now. Smufs are sunbathing. Sun and blue sky. What more do they need?

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 16-1-2008(3): Once it clears up, the sun will wash your blues away!
