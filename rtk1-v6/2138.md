1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 17-3-2008(215): Anyone living in Japan knows that train<strong> station</strong>s play little melodies when the train is about to arrive. In Ye Olden Days, when <em>horses</em> and carriages were used for transport, the carriage driver would play a little melody on his <em>shakuhachi</em> to let the passengers know the carriage was arriving at the next<strong> station</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jreaves">jreaves</a>] 23-7-2007(160): This reminds me of those infamous Mexican porn movies in which shakuhachi is performed on a horse. Here the deed is being done at a train<strong> station</strong>. As the passengers get off, so does the horse.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 20-7-2007(27): I got off at the<strong> station</strong> and saw a <em>trojan horse</em> getting a <em>shakuhachi</em> (blowjob).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/melchan">melchan</a>] 28-7-2009(11): In this train line the wagons are <em>trojan horses</em> and at each<strong> station</strong> the driver plays a little melody on his <em>shakuhachi</em> to let the passengers know they arrived at the next<strong> station</strong>. [thanks rtkrtk].
