heisig: "The kindness and hard work of the ideal <b>father</b> is seen in this abbreviation of the <i>taskmaster</i> that leaves off his rod or whip (the first stroke) and replaces it with the sweat of the <b>father's</b> brow (the two <i>drops</i> at the top)."

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sleepyday">sleepyday</a>] 26-10-2008(59): Not to confuse anyone, but I think if you put your mind to it, you can see the image of a<strong> father</strong> here. The first two strokes take on the form of his eye brows, and the third and fourth stroke make up the nose and mustache.
