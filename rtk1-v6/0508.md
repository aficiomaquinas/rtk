1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ameyama">Ameyama</a>] 4-4-2008(138): <strong>Can-Can</strong>-ers <strong>lack</strong> the ability to sing a <strong>song</strong>, so they just dance.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 17-12-2006(64): <em>Can-can</em> dancers are supposed to be big-bosomed girls who dance. Yet these so called can-can dancers are flat-chested and singing a<strong> song</strong>, so audience of men is <em>yawn</em>ing in boredom.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 5-6-2009(38): Do you know the &quot;Obama<strong> song</strong>&quot;? It goes like: &quot;Yes we <em>can</em>, yes we <em>can</em>!&quot; The problem is, the lyrics repeat so often that everybody starts <em>yawning</em> sooner or later. - This is no political comment ;-).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BigAmish">BigAmish</a>] 15-8-2008(36): Modern<strong> SONG</strong>stresses have <em>doubly-nice CANs</em>, but <em>LACK</em> true musical talent.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaeru">kaeru</a>] 7-11-2008(18): The Idol contestants think &quot;I CAN I CAN SING THIS<strong> SONG</strong>&quot; but most of them LACK talent.
