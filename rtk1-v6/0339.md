heisig: "Look more closely at your <i>lidded crock</i> and you will see little ruler marks along its bottom edge. This is so you can use it to calculate the <b>circumference</b> of your <i>motorcycle helmet</i>: just begin at a fixed point and turn the <i>lidded crock</i> around and around, keeping it flush against the side of the <i>helmet</i>, until you come back to your starting point. If you kept track of how many turns and part-turns your <i>lidded crock</i> made, you now know the <b>circumference</b>."
commen: "* As a primitive, this character can take the added significance of a <i>lap</i>."
