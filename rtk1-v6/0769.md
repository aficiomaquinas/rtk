1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 29-7-2006(198): (Adapted from darg_sama&#039;s) Balancing a <em>branch</em> on your <em>finger</em> is the prototypical example of a<strong> skill</strong> that is nothing more than a<strong> skill</strong> (i.e., it is completely useless).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 24-10-2005(70): I think of a guy balancing a branch on his finger, which definitely takes some minimal amount of<strong> skill</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 10-5-2008(63): Better be <strong>skilled</strong> with your <em>finger</em> if all you&#039;ve got is a <em>needle</em> <em>crotch</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 5-4-2009(52): Forget balancing branches and stupid shit like that. It takes real<strong> skill</strong> to <em>finger</em> <em>ten</em> <em>crotches</em> at the same time. For real, nobody was ever a hero for balancing branches.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ceryn">Ceryn</a>] 6-6-2008(31): Grasping a BRANCH with their FINGERS was the first<strong> SKILL</strong> that premodern humans learned.
