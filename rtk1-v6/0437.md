1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 22-10-2007(203): There is a <em>graveyard</em> outside my house that scares me, so I put a huge towel over the window to serve as a<strong> curtain</strong> so I can get a good nights sleep.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu">ruisu</a>] 21-11-2007(59): When you&#039;re dead in the <em>graveyard</em>, &quot;it&#039;s <strong>curtains</strong> for you.&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 17-7-2008(34): When a mobster says &quot;It&#039;s gonna be<strong> curtain</strong>s for you!&quot; He means you&#039;ll be wrapped in a towel, dead in a graveyard.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 19-6-2008(24): After Towelie died, instead of burying him in a grave, we hung him up as a<strong> curtain</strong> so the neighbours couldn&#039;t see us hitting the bong.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xeyes">xeyes</a>] 21-5-2007(17): If you&#039;ve read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (SPOILERS AHEAD!)...think of the<strong> curtain</strong> in the depths of the Department of Mysteries, and what happens when Sirius encounters that<strong> curtain</strong>. (Well, yes, it&#039;s technically a veil, but since Heisig doesn&#039;t use that as a keyword, think of it as a really big...um...<em>towel</em>.).
