1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 22-8-2007(233): <strong>Immature</strong> <em>turkeys</em> are stuffed with <em>wheat</em> to make it look bigger.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 20-4-2008(107): I can&#039;t believe I brought you to the fanciest restaurant in town and you asked for <em>turkey</em> on <em>wheat</em>...how<strong> immature</strong> is that?!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wosret">Wosret</a>] 3-9-2008(28): It&#039;s<strong> immature</strong> to whip <strong>turkeys</strong> with <strong>wheat</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 20-11-2006(28): The only <em>wheat</em> that a <em>turkey</em> is able to reach for eating is<strong> immature</strong> and shouldn&#039;t be touched. Wheat that is ready for harvest is as tall as a human. Shoo the turkeys away from the fields! Gobble gobble! (I guess there&#039;s no crows in Japan?).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tryllid">tryllid</a>] 30-8-2008(23): Wheat + Turkey: This is NOT Fresh (Fish + Sheep). Wheat and turkeys have to mature before they are harvested - both are not very good when they are<strong> immature</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 7-8-2008(20): Imagine you begin to pour <em>cereal</em> into your bowl when instead a whole <em>turkey</em> comes out of the box. Your little brother/sister is nearby pointing and laughing. &quot;You&#039;re so<strong> immature</strong>,&quot; you say.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skylarth">skylarth</a>] 24-9-2007(14): Man that kid is<strong> immature</strong>, all he eats is <em>turkey</em> on <em>wheat</em>, he wont even eat fruit.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/The_Rabbit">The_Rabbit</a>] 19-1-2009(12): <strong>Immature</strong> turkeys, especially high-schoolers, think that smoking wheat is cool. Imagine a group of turkeys in leather jackets standing in the bathroom smoking in defiance of the principal.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rptb1">rptb1</a>] 11-11-2005(10): If you feed<strong> immature</strong> green wheat to turkeys, they lay green eggs, which go well with ham.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 16-11-2008(8): Young (immature) kids only want to eat cereal and turkey sandwiches.
