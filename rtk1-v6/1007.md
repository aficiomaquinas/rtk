heisig: "<b>Bamboo</b> grows upwards, like a straight <i>nail</i>, and at each stage of its growth (which legend associates with the arrival of the new moon) there is a jointed rootstock (the first stroke). Two such <b>bamboo</b> stalks are pictured here."
commen: "* As a primitive, the meaning remains the same, but the vertical lines are severely abbreviated so that they can take their place at the top where, like <i>flowers</i>, they are always to be found."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 30-6-2008(99): Pandas like to eat<strong> bamboo</strong>. I&#039;m using panda as the primitive name when it fits the story. ^__^.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 5-7-2009(39): Two <em>reclining</em> victims impaled by<strong> bamboo</strong> <em>spikes</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44">brian44</a>] 18-11-2007(36): Since this is a really common kanji and so easy to remember on its own, I just remembered it by it&#039;s reading, which is たけ.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 27-9-2010(9): I see this pictographically. Stroke 1: leaf. Stroke 2: joint of stalk. Stroke 3: section of stalk. And it&#039;s doubled because it comes in groves (just as you double &quot;tree&quot; to make &quot;grove&quot;).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bigpapalove17">bigpapalove17</a>] 10-10-2010(6): Oh NO, NO (think katakana), two pieces of<strong> BAMBOO</strong> stabbed TJ.
