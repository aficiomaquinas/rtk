heisig: "Another pictograph, this kanji looks like a bird's-eye view of a <b>rice field</b> divided into four plots. Be careful when writing this character to get the order of the strokes correct. You will find that it follows perfectly the principle stated in frame 4."
commen: "* When used as a primitive element, the meaning of <i>rice field</i> is most common, but now and again it will take the meaning of <i>brains</i> from the fact that it looks a bit like that tangle of gray matter nestled under our skulls."
