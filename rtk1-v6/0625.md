1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball">Thunderball</a>] 27-9-2007(241): When you are admitted into a<strong> group</strong> like the Yakuza, you&#039;re well and truly done (だん) for. You must stick to the<strong> group</strong> like <em>glue</em>, and you will be <em>pent-in</em> for life, never being able to leave.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle">calittle</a>] 23-9-2007(54): A <em>pent-in</em><strong> group</strong> will naturally be more cohesive, or &quot;<em>glued</em> together.&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rizzo">rizzo</a>] 21-10-2005(43): Living in Japan, this image is too true for comfort. Every<strong> group</strong> I&#039;ve ever encoutered sticks together like <em>glue</em>, but it seems thats not enough so they create little barriers to keep outsiders out and insiders in, once someone finds their<strong> group</strong> they are pretty much <em>pent in</em> for life. (that felt good).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Henduluin">Henduluin</a>] 15-1-2008(25): For the Haruhism people: SOS-dan!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 9-9-2007(24): Picture a bunch of<strong> group</strong>ies on a tour bus with some big rock band. The band members are getting tired of these<strong> group</strong>ies, so the band leaves the tour bus, superglues the door and the windows shut, and leave them all pent up in the bus.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 1-11-2009(17): Mathematically speaking,<strong> group</strong>s are associative (hence the <em>glue</em>) and closed (hence the <em>enclosure</em> radical).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 16-11-2008(9): When being attacked by zombies, it is a good idea to <em>stick together</em> as a <strong>group</strong>. Should you find yourself <em>pent up</em> in a house or building of any kind, you are done for. Watching any zombie movie will help you to understand this point, and perhaps using this story will save your life some day.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnfcolt">johnfcolt</a>] 9-4-2012(7): <strong>Group</strong> mentality: to stick together within the confines of your<strong> group</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 18-5-2008(6): They <em>pent us in</em> a room for months and <em>glued</em> all of the exits shut.. It got pretty boring.. Luckily the<strong> group</strong> sex kept us entertained.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 15-2-2007(6): Every<strong> group</strong> (clique) is <em>glued</em> together and <em>closed</em> to outsiders.
