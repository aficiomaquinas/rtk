heisig: "The character for <i>enter</i> (Frame 842) showed someone walking inwards (in terms of the direction of writing), the one for <b>person</b>, shown here, represents someone walking outwards."
commen: "* As a primitive, it can keep its kanji form except when it appears to the left (its normal position), where it is made to stand up in the form ⺅ (Similar to イ).
The primitive meaning is another matter. The abstract notion of <i>person</i> so often has a relation to the meaning of the kanji that confusion readily sets in. So many of the previous stories have included people in them that simply to use <i>person</i> for a primitive meaning would be risky. We need to be more specific, to focus on one particular <i>person</i>. Try to choose someone who has not figured in the stories so far, perhaps a colorful member of the family or a friend whom you have known for a long time. That individual will appear again and again, so be sure to choose someone who excites your imagination."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 27-11-2008(156): Behold Mister T (of &quot;A-Team&quot; fame)! I chose Mr.T because he&#039;s sure to make amusing stories. He is a very versatile character since he&#039;s both the big, tough guy and the “moralistic”<strong> person</strong>, telling kids not “to do drugs or alcohol”. He is easy to imagine, the heavy gold chains are probably the most prominent feature of the character. And last but not least you can always pepper your story with the famous line “I pity da foo!” * Fittingly, on the left side of the kanji, it looks like a “T”.

That makes it easier to substitute <em>Mr. T</em>, <em>Captain Picard</em>, or whomever else a student is using as <strong>person.</strong>].

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 31-12-2007(30): For this character, I&#039;m going to use Chuck Norris. He is a world class martial artist, winning several karate championships in a row. He also achieved ultimate power according to his Chuck Norris Facts, and works as a Texas Ranger (sheriff). He is however a very kind and religious<strong> person</strong>. Here we have a view of his powerful legs, while the contracted form shows him performing a roundhouse kick.
