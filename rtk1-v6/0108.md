1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 24-6-2008(107): Caution: this means a spell, not to swear. I put a<strong> curse</strong> on my <em>elder brother</em> so that he can never open his <em>mouth</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 14-2-2007(22): Your <em>older brother</em>&#039;s <em>mouth</em> often <strong>curses</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 13-2-2007(15): There&#039;s an ancient<strong> curse</strong> in this region whereby the firstborn son, i.e. the <em>elder brother</em>, is always born with an extra <em>mouth</em>. And regardless of the elder brother&#039;s own personality, the extra mouth is bad tempered and always <strong>cursing</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 21-6-2010(5): A <em>mouthy teenager</em> is<strong> curse</strong>d to get into trouble time and time again.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 10-2-2012(3): It&#039;s interesting how Halparn, Henshall and &quot;Kanji Learners Dictionary&quot; all forfeit to include this kanji, yet kana-heavy games like Final Fantasy assumes their gamer has knowledge of this kanji. Just sayin&#039;. Story: I put a <strong>curse</strong> on the <em>mouth</em> of my <em>older brother</em> to shut him up. He&#039;s an annoying bugger, after all.
