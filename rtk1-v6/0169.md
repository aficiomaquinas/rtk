heisig: "After seeing a constant <b>horizon</b> of <i>water</i>, <i>water</i> everywhere for months at sea, could there be anything more delightful to the eyes than to look astern and see the <i>ivy</i>-clad <i>cliffs</i> of land on a new <b>horizon</b>? Of course, you'd need the eyes of a stellar telescope to recognize that the vegetation was in fact <i>ivy</i>, but the phrase &quot;<i>ivy</i>-clad <i>cliffs</i>&quot; has such a nice ring to it that we won't worry about such details."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun">sutebun</a>] 10-9-2007(230): Try to reverse Heisig&#039;s story in this Kanji: imagine being trapped in one of those prison towers on an ivy cladcliff like in the movies. From your prison ontop the ivy clad cliff all you can see in the distant<strong> horizon</strong> is nothing but water.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jljzen">jljzen</a>] 3-1-2009(72): From the water, I can see the ivy-clad-cliffs on the<strong> horizon</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 8-5-2008(39): Over the WATER and past the<strong> HORIZON</strong> there is said to be a CLIFF that holds a very rare JEWEL.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mdspencer">mdspencer</a>] 14-4-2008(17): Across the <em>water</em>, I can see <em>ivy</em> covered <em>cliffs</em> on the<strong> horizon</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 23-3-2007(11): Since Hesig doesn&#039;t have another Kanji with the keyword of &quot;shore&quot; it might be worth pointing out to folks here that this is the alternate meaning for this kanji asides from<strong> horizon</strong>. Also meshes well with Hesig&#039;s story spotting those Ivy clad Cliffs on the<strong> horizon</strong>. Spotting green and beautiful shore-land off in the distance across the water!!
