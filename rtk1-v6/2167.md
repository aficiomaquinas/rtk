1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 3-6-2007(149): <em>Bruce Lee</em><strong> shake</strong>s the confidence of his opponents by simply waving his <em>fingers</em> in front of them, they know that each of them is a deadly weapon in their own right. Hwwaaaa...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSlakey">TheSlakey</a>] 7-1-2009(116): Your fingers will be crushed if you<strong> shake</strong> hands with Bruce Lee.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 14-1-2006(21): Here someone<strong> shake</strong>s hands with <em>Bruce Lee</em> and then asks for his <em>fingers</em> back. Note : my first idea was the &quot;finger-shake&quot;, Shrek the ogre&#039;s favourite milk-shake; I couldn&#039;t fit <em>sign of the dragon</em> into the story though.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 12-7-2009(13): <em>Bruce Lee</em><strong> shake</strong>s his <em>finger</em> at an opponent who thinks they&#039;re a match for him.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 31-10-2009(12): If you&#039;re talking to someone and notice that their<em>fingers</em> are starting to<strong> shake</strong>, it&#039;s often a <em>sign of the dragon</em> being behind you where the other person can see him coming.
