1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle">calittle</a>] 7-10-2007(162): Scientists recently measured the<strong> diameter</strong> of Earth by drilling a deep hole and dropping a <em>line</em> of thread off a humongous <em>spool</em> until it got to the other side.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 18-2-2008(109): Suggestion: Replace &quot;spool&quot; with &quot;toilet paper/roll&quot;. Reasons: (1) <em>Toilet paper/roll</em> usually comes on a <em>spool</em>. (2) <em>Toilet paper</em> is used to clean the <em>soil</em> off your <em>crotch</em>. Story: Measure the<strong> diameter</strong> of a <em>column</em> (maybe Nelson&#039;s Column in London?) using a roll of <em>toilet paper</em>. Spool also appears in <a href="../v4/715.html">stalk</a> (#715 茎), <a href="../v4/716.html">suspicious</a> (#716 怪), <a href="../v4/717.html">lightly</a> (#717 軽), <a href="../v4/1360.html">sutra</a> (#1360 経).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/randomkrazy">randomkrazy</a>] 31-1-2009(38): I&#039;m <em>going</em> to measure the<strong> diameter</strong> of your <em>crotch</em>, sorry I know it sounds <em>dirty</em> but its for the good of science!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jamestaverner">jamestaverner</a>] 22-12-2007(29): <em>Lance Armstrong</em> wins because his bike has wheels with a bigger<strong> diameter</strong>. This raises his <em>crotch</em> higher off the <em>ground</em>, giving him more pedalling power. (After winning the Tour de France so many times, the French public liked him almost as much as Princess Di (they use her as the yardstick to measure how much they like celebrities. You could even say that he went up a few notches on the Princess <strong>Di-a-Meter</strong>... (sorry))).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eltjopoort">eltjopoort</a>] 10-6-2008(16): The <em>column</em> of soldiers to the left has been assigned to measure the<strong> diameter</strong> of a bomb crater. They carry a huge <em>spool</em> of measuring tape with them as they march to the other side.
