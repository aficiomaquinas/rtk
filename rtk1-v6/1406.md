1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 5-2-2007(205): <em>All</em> buildings of <em>The Pinnacle</em> are multi-<strong>storey</strong>. They don&#039;t have much room, so they have to build up. It sucks when someone presses <em>all</em> the buttons on the elevator! You have to stop at each <strong>storey</strong>!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 25-2-2008(81): Some stupid kid has pushed <em>all</em> the buttons in the elevator. As it stops at <em>all</em><strong> storey</strong>s you reach a <em>pinnacle</em> of impatience. Finally you reach your<strong> storey</strong>, the last one, at the <em>pinnacle</em> of the building.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/b0ng0">b0ng0</a>] 4-2-2009(42): The <em>pinnacle</em> of a building is the sum of <em>all</em> the<strong> storey</strong>s.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 14-12-2006(11): The second<strong> storey</strong> of the acropolis is the Laundrymopolis, where the elite Greeks meet to compare the whiteness of their sheets.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jaunty">Jaunty</a>] 7-8-2009(9): You&#039;re taking the elevator up to the <em>pinnacle</em>, and someone presses <em>all</em> the buttons, making <em>everyone</em> wait while it stops at every<strong> storey</strong> (thanks dingomick).
