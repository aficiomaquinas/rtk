1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 4-12-2005(270): <strong>Marriage</strong> is the <em>day</em> in this <em>woman</em>&#039;s life where she gets a new <em>family name</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 20-2-2008(90): Tip: Heisig later introduces the kanji 昏 <a href="../v4/2451.html">dusk</a> (#2451 昏). Story: Never enter into<strong> marriage</strong> with a <em>woman</em> at <em>dusk</em> (wait until you see them in daylight). Note: This is an ancient proverb . . . (probably).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 19-6-2008(26): My goodness, between this story and surname and matrimony.. Ouch. I apologize in advance for this one, ladies, but if I don&#039;t make this story memorable this kanji will haunt me forever. Ok, here goes:<strong> Marriage</strong> is the day a <em>woman</em> is changed forever. Not only does she get a new <em>family name</em> but she can start using her <em>mouth with a wagging tongue</em> to nag instead of those other unspeakable acts that her husband used to enjoy..

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 29-3-2013(24): 3 Kanji related with<strong> marriage</strong>, all the 3 with the primitive WOMAN. 嫁 <a href="../v4/542.html">marry into</a> (#542 嫁): Since the man is hardly ever home, the woman feels more like she&#039;s married into the HOUSE . 姻 <a href="../v4/584.html">matrimony</a> (#584 姻): is the state you get after the<strong> marriage</strong>, in which the woman has got you PENT IN like a DOG, so that you cannot go after other bitches. 婚 <a href="../v4/1830.html">marriage</a> (#1830 婚): is &quot;THE&quot; day in this woman&#039;s life where she gets a new FAMILY NAME. Remember that<strong> MARRIAGE</strong> begins one DAY, whereas MATRIMONY is the state you get after the<strong> MARRIAGE</strong>.
