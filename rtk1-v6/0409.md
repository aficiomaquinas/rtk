2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 14-3-2008(173): The best stories for this kanji tend to have a thief in them, which always makes me confuse them with the kanji for burglar (357). So, let&#039;s try this one: My girlfriend wears a <em>metal</em> chastity belt with a <strong>lock</strong> but I am <em>determined</em> to open it! I must get inside!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy">howdycowdy</a>] 3-3-2008(81): A<strong> LOCK</strong> is <em>metal</em> that is <em>determined</em> to keep intruders out.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep">pazustep</a>] 16-7-2008(73): A<strong> lock</strong> is a piece of <em>metal</em> that will <em>determine</em> who can or can&#039;t get in.
