1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-9-2007(133): The <strong>hinge</strong> on <em>Wolverine&#039;s</em> <em>cardboard box</em> is made of wood because he doesn&#039;t have enough budget to buy metal <strong>hinge</strong>s.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 2-9-2008(101): You notice a<strong> hinge</strong> on a <em>tree</em> and realize there&#039;s a secret door. You open it up to find an <em>Xbox</em>!!!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 25-6-2006(47): The<strong> hinge</strong> in this hospital <em>ward</em> was made of <em>wood</em> because they didn&#039;t have enough budget to buy metal<strong> hinge</strong>s.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 5-4-2009(32): I like using &quot;X Box&quot; as the primitive instead of ward. The first <em>X Box</em> had a lot of problems. I guess Microsoft was in a hurry to get it out. I even noticed that the<strong> hinge</strong>s were made of <em>wood</em>... what the hell?

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 22-4-2007(17): Make sure you install the<strong> hinge</strong> the right way. If it opens <em>treeward</em> (= <em>tree</em> <em>ward</em>), you won&#039;t be able to get the fence open, make sure it opens houseward.
