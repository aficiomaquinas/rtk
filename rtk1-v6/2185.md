1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 19-1-2006(195): You&#039;ve entered in a chinese shop where apparently the only<strong> item</strong> in sale is old, dusty, <em>hardened bamboo</em> (for construction for example). It looks like these<strong> item</strong>s have been there forever. Asking the clerk if anything else is available, he doesn&#039;t understand and instead asks - &quot;Two<strong> item</strong>s? Three<strong> item</strong>s?&quot; (the kanji is a counter for<strong> item</strong>s) - thinking you want to buy something.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 30-1-2008(96): Dragon Quest - You find a <em>hardened bamboo</em> stick, perfect for a weapon, but you can&#039;t pick it up because your<strong> item</strong>s are full.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 2-1-2008(23): When I checked the <strong>items</strong> on the shopping list my wife gave me, I did a double take when i saw <em>hardened bamboo</em>. What the hell kind of<strong> item</strong> is that and what could she want with it?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtcamero">dtcamero</a>] 22-9-2010(18): When she saw my <em>BAMBOO HARDEN</em> we became an <strong>ITEM</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BooBooQ88">BooBooQ88</a>] 20-12-2009(9): Bamboo<strong> ITEM</strong>S will become hard and brittle over time.
