1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 26-5-2008(79): Wow, that baker must really be mad! He&#039;s trying to<strong> BREAK</strong> his MORTAR by throwing it to the SOIL. Whoa! Now he&#039;s aiming a MISSILE at it!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 17-9-2007(40): To &quot;<strong>break</strong> the <em>soil</em>&quot; is to make a symbolic gesture that indicates the beginning of construction. Like when a politician in a hardhat gets a shovel and lifts a piece of dirt. This particular project is behind schedule, so to speed things up, they blow it up with <em>mortar</em> and an air-to-ground <em>missile</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 7-2-2010(23): Drawing inspiration from <a href="../v4/709.html">beat</a> (#709 撃) by kinkypete, this kanji shows the rules for a bizarre form of janken (paper, stone, scissors). A mortar can<strong> break</strong> soil (grinding it to dust). Soil can<strong> break</strong> a missile (burying it - causing it to eventually rust away). And a missile can<strong> break</strong> a mortar.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eatyoda">eatyoda</a>] 9-12-2008(6): You&#039;ll<strong> break</strong> everything down to <em>dirt</em> if you use both <em>mortars</em> and <em>missiles</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 11-10-2008(6): Someone tried to<strong> break</strong> into <em>Staples</em> using a <em>missile</em>, but it ended up<strong> break</strong>ing the whole store, turning it to <em>dirt</em>.
