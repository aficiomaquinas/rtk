heisig: "This character is actually a picture of the moon, with the two horizontal lines representing the left eye and mouth of the mythical &quot;man in the moon.&quot; (Actually, the Japanese see a hare in the moon, but it is a little farfetched to find one in the kanji.) And one <b>month</b>, of course, is one cycle of the moon."
commen: "* As a primitive element, this character can take on the sense of <i>moon</i>, <i>flesh</i>, or <i>part of the body</i>. The reasons for the latter two meanings will be explained in a later chapter."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 19-5-2008(157): A<strong> month</strong> is longer than a day.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 21-3-2007(60): Am I the only one who sees this as someone sticking their ass in the air &quot;mooning&quot; someone (two cheeks of the butt and the legs coming off of it)? The Moon meaning connects well to the meaning of<strong> month</strong>, considering that<strong> month</strong>s were traditionally measured by the phases of the moon. Also, the mooning &quot;ass&quot; part of it connects well to Hesig&#039;s seemingly unconnected &quot;flesh&quot; or &quot;part of the body&quot; meaning (when used in primitive form).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijingo">gaijingo</a>] 16-6-2006(15): <strong>Month</strong> - every MOON cycle, werewolves eat FLESH, and other PARTs OF THE BODY.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuki56">Tsuki56</a>] 6-6-2009(12): Once a<strong> month</strong>, the moon is full.
