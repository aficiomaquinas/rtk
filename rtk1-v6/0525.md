1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narafan">narafan</a>] 18-7-2007(156): Deceased eyes! Easy ;).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tgray88">tgray88</a>] 4-10-2008(73): A person with <em>deceased</em> <em>eyes</em> is<strong> blind</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 18-7-2007(18): Rather than &quot;dead eyes,&quot; break down DECEASED into TOPHAT and FISHHOOK, and picture each<strong> blind</strong> person&#039;s EYES as being unable to see because their eyes are covered with a TOP HAT, that&#039;s attached to a FISHHOOK stabbed in their eyeballs.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 25-7-2007(10): I keep messing up the order of the primitives here. To emphasise the position, imagine the<strong> blind</strong> person wanting to take his <em>top hat</em> off the <em>hook</em>. Before he does that, though, he needs to re-attach his <em>eye</em>balls, which are rolling around on the floor.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crayonmaster">crayonmaster</a>] 8-2-2009(3): The<strong> blind</strong> man could not see anything with his EYES, but he claimed, when he looked up, he could see the DECEASED existing above.
