1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 16-3-2007(264): Most don&#039;t know it, but <strong>bear</strong>s have the <em>ability</em> to walk on <em>fire</em>. They&#039;re invincible creatures!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 12-1-2006(154): Note : I don&#039;t know why James Heisig put &quot;bear&quot; ahead of &quot;ability&quot; (next frame), but I sugget to skip this, learn the next kanji (&quot;ability&quot;) then go back here and use <em>ability</em> as a primitive.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 23-6-2008(78): <strong>Bear</strong>s have the <strong>ability</strong> to smell food cooking on a camp<strong>fire</strong> from over 30ks away (true).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cgillz34">cgillz34</a>] 24-2-2009(25): Smokey the<strong> Bear</strong> says: Only you have the ability to prevent forest fires.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 6-5-2007(19): Well, this is obviously the story of Goldilocks, who came to the<strong> bear</strong> house. She <em>elbows</em> her way in, throws her <em>flesh</em> into a chair, notices the porridge on the <em>oven fire</em>, takes one <em>spoon</em>full from one plate, then another <em>spoon</em>full from another plate.
