heisig: "Let the idea of <b>drawing near</b> suggest something dangerous or eerie that one approaches with fear and trembling. Here we see a <i>strange house</i> - perhaps the haunted <i>House</i> of Usher that Edgar Allen Poe immortalized, or the enchanted Gingerbread <i>House</i> that lured Hansel and Gretel to <b>draw near</b>."
