heisig: "Maybe this helps you see how the Japanese have no trouble keeping <b>convex</b> distinct from <i>concave</i>. Note the odd feeling of the third stroke. If it doesn't feel all that strange now, by the time you are done with this book, it will. There are very few times you will have to write it."

(Remember the three segments of the step down are one stroke. There is no such equivalent for the step up, so you have to take it segment by segment.) The bottom is just like mouth.
