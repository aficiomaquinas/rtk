heisig: "The radiant, <b>effulgent</b> splendor of he <i>sun</i> makes it <i>king</i> of all the planets and other stars. Just to be sure you don't take this too abstractly, picture the <i>sun</i> seated on a throne, flourishing its <i>scepter</i> this way and that."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 7-6-2007(60): The <em>Sun King</em> (Louis XIV) was known for his<strong> effulgent</strong> reign.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 2-8-2008(19): [+katsuo] This is the <em>Sun King</em>. Sayeth Wikipedia: &quot;The <em>Sun King</em> (in French le Roi Soleil) because of the idea that, just as the planets revolve around the <em>Sun</em>, so too should France and the court revolve around [the <em>king</em>] (&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France</a>). And just like the <em>sun</em>, he was quite<strong> effulgent</strong> and actually emitted <em>sun</em>light.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Woodsei">Woodsei</a>] 10-3-2012(13): The <em>sun</em> is the<strong> effulgent</strong> <em>king</em> of stars.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/montecristo73">montecristo73</a>] 17-6-2010(7): The sun is the king of<strong> effulgent</strong> bodies in the sky.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amillerchip">amillerchip</a>] 4-1-2012(4): Eeffulgent? I&#039;ll never remember that. Renaming this <strong>full of vigor</strong>. The <em>king</em> always started the <em>day</em> <strong>full of vigor</strong>, ready to rule his kingdom like the nobles of old.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 2-2-2011(2): The <em>day</em> after the <em>King&#039;s</em> speech, everyone could see that he was<strong> effulgent</strong>.<strong> Effulgent</strong> can mean bright (as in light), bright as in sound and also beaming (as in happy/contented). The Kings speech was described as<strong> effulgent</strong> not only because of the manner of delivery, but also because of the effect it had on people. They became bright too. I have troubles with this word because it is not a word I knew before.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 31-7-2010(1): (Elaborating on Katsuo&#039;s theme). <strong>Effulgency</strong> is &quot;radiant splendor&quot;---like that of Versailles and its tenant, the <em>Sun King</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 25-1-2010(1): Louis XIV, the <em>sun king</em>, was an <strong>awful</strong> person, but he always conducted himself in a <strong>gent</strong>lemanly manner. So he could be described as an <strong>awful gent</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/faneca">faneca</a>] 2-5-2013(): (I&#039;ll use a bad wordplay to differentiate this keyword from others) I won you the poker match <strong>effulgently</strong>: I had <em>suns</em> <strong>FULL</strong> of <em>kings</em> ( 日日日王王 ), you had no chance with your aces full of kings (AAAKK). Why are you upset? What do you mean by &quot;<em>suns</em> do not exist in poker&quot;?

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andreki">andreki</a>] 21-2-2013(): Geht die <em>Sonne</em> auf, wird der Sonnen-<em>König</em> munter.
