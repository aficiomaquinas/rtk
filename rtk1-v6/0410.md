heisig: "<b>Running</b>, we are told here, <i>mends</i> the <i>soil</i>. Observe in the following frames how this kanji can embrace other elements from below, much the same way as the element for <i>road</i> does; and how, in order to do this, the final stroke needs to be lengthened."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Samchan">Samchan</a>] 4-8-2008(319): Hint: This kanji is NOT <em>soil</em> on top of <em>mend</em>, as Heisig claims - that would duplicate one of the strokes. Instead, it is <em>10</em> on top of <em>mend</em>. So my story is: If you<strong> run</strong> <em>10</em> miles, you will need to <em>mend</em> your socks!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/poseid0n">poseid0n</a>] 11-7-2007(33): The sports ground needs MENDING after the game as the players have been<strong> RUN</strong>NING around which has caused the ground to be chopped up.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonjimbo2000">jonjimbo2000</a>] 11-4-2007(29): The <em>soil</em> needs <em>mending</em> after the cross-country<strong> run</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 16-5-2009(9): With ten things to mend, you&#039;ve got to<strong> run</strong> to get it all done.
