heisig: "This character, a pictographic representation of the <b>heart</b>, is among the most widely used primitives we shall meet."
primit: "As a primitive, it can take three forms, to which we shall assign three distinct meanings. * In its kanji-form, it appears beneath or to the right of its relative primitive and means the physical organ of the heart. * To the left, it is abbreviated to three strokes, °, and means a wildly emotional state of mind. * And finally, at the very bottom, it can take the form a, in which case we give it the meaning of a valentine."

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 7-6-2006(9): When this primitive is on the left as <em>state of mind</em>, I had a hard time visualizing it. Thus I have created the following story. All the smartest people in the country were fed up with their state governments. These great <em>minds</em> joined together and created their own official <em>state</em>: the <em>state of Mind</em>. I visualize it as a small, sectioned off area with brains floating around. A scientific utopia.

Jack the Ripper is portrayed as a smooth, cold killer reminiscent of Hannibal).

I <em>racked my brains</em> ( 腐心 ,ふしん) to come up with a plan, but I knew I would need to infiltrate the <em>nuclear reactor core</em> ( 炉心 ,ろしん). Unfortunately, because I was so <em>inexperienced</em> ( 初心 ,うぶ) in such matters, my <em>mentality</em> ( 心理 ,しんり) gave me <em>nausea</em> ( 悪心 ,おしん).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nyaaa">nyaaa</a>] 13-8-2012(2): The four chambers of the<strong> heart</strong> aren&#039;t all equal-sized.
