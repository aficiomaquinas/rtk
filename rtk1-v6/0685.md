heisig: "First note the stroke order of this character, which did not really evolve from the <i>heart</i>, even though we take it that way. If one takes it as a pictograph &quot;dividing&quot; <i>the heart</i> in half, then one has one of those <b>invariably</b> true bits of human anatomy: the fact that each <i>heart</i> is divided into two halves."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 27-10-2007(203): You swear you&#039;ll be in love forever, but<strong> invariably</strong> there comes a time when your <em>heart</em> is <em>divided</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 12-6-2008(97): For this kanji I<strong> invariably</strong> got the stroke order wrong. I nearly lost <em>heart</em>, but decided to <em>stick</em> (pun) to it. Then I noticed the order is 1) katakana ソ (altered slightly); 2) fishhook; 3) two drops. Now I<strong> invariably</strong> get it right.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 21-9-2009(71): A <em>stake</em> through the <em>heart</em><strong> invariably</strong> kills a vampire. (As a primitive this can take the meaning &#039;<strong>vampire</strong>&#039;).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christoph">Christoph</a>] 16-8-2006(20): A heart that has been slashed becomes<strong> invariably</strong> altered forever.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matstc">matstc</a>] 14-1-2009(19): When you say &#039;cross my heart&#039;, you will<strong> invariably</strong> keep your word.
