1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 16-1-2007(266): At the local pub, their<strong> bartending</strong> practises are unusual. They serve the <em>whiskey</em> by pouring it from a <em>ladle</em>, like one would from the punch bowl.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 29-1-2008(23): Ever seen the anime Bartender?<strong> Bartending</strong> isn&#039;t just about <em>bottles of whiskey</em>, it&#039;s about <em>ladling</em> out advice.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mithrila">mithrila</a>] 6-7-2009(15): Old fashioned<strong> bartending</strong> had the server ladle out the alcohol from a giant whiskey bottle.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 30-5-2009(7): Coyote Ugly! The girls <strong>&quot;bartending&quot;</strong> in the bar don&#039;t use <em>whiskey bottles</em> - they use <em>ladles</em> and pour everything over their bodies. What a show! Where was the bar exactly?

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb">elmaestrokgb</a>] 25-7-2009(6): <strong>Bartending</strong> consists mainly of giving the customer the proper amount. That&#039;s why they dispense from a <em>whiskey bottle</em> into a special <em>ladle</em> to measure the RIGHT amount.
