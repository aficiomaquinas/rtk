heisig: "The element for <i>day</i> on the left is logical enough. Next to it we see <i>staples</i> being held in <i>mouth</i> (one stroke is doubled up), indicating working in one's hobby or handicrafts at home on one's <b>spare time</b>. The small <i>box</i> at the top right is facing backwards, or more properly &quot;inside out.&quot; Finally, we have the <i>crotch</i> at the bottom."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zareon">Zareon</a>] 5-4-2007(314): Some jackass-like people have way too much<strong> spare time</strong>. You can find video&#039;s of them all over the internet, if you like such things, you can watch it all <em>day</em>. You see them <em>stapling</em> their <em>mouths</em> shut, or throwing eachother <em>upside down in boxes</em> or kicking each other in the <em>crotch</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-2-2008(94): Tip: The complex right side of this kanji appears twice more in Heisig. He later names it &quot;hobby&quot;. REF: <a href="../v4/2689.html">shrimp</a> (#2689 蝦), <a href="../v4/2779.html">haze</a> (#2779 霞).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster">snallygaster</a>] 18-6-2008(48): I avoid using &quot;mouth&quot; here because it makes me mess up the stroke order. Instead I use a flag/staple combo. Hopefully you&#039;ve seen the Justin Timberlake &quot;dick in a box&quot; spoof. Someone has a lot of<strong> spare time</strong>, so he decides to spend the <em>day</em> making an especially elaborate dick in a box. There&#039;s a <em>flag</em> <em>stapled</em> to the box as decoration (like wrapping paper). He rigs it up so he can instantly flip the <em>box inside-out</em> to reveal his <em>crotch</em>. Well, it&#039;s a vivid image once you get it. He&#039;s my hero.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 17-9-2009(23): A pervert&#039;s <strong>hobby</strong> (see Katsuo): He turns <em>two boxes</em> upside-down (&quot;コ&quot;) and <em>staples</em> them together - that makes them look like a bench. Then he hides in it and waits until some girls come and sit down. What can he see? Of course their <em>crotches</em>! If he does that all <em>day</em> he won&#039;t have<strong> spare time</strong> for anything else.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inaka_rob">inaka_rob</a>] 17-4-2012(13): WARNING EXPLICIT!!! In my<strong> spare time</strong>, basically all DAY long, I STAPLE a few things to the wall. a picture of a woman&#039;s mouth and outward facing &quot;box&quot;. I think you know what I do with my crotch.
