1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 22-6-2008(283): Guess what? Japanese has dirty words too! (In fact, a lot of them) A sexual story is NOT inappropriate here, as this kanji is very sexual, such as in 性欲 ; lust. As for a story: the <em>lack</em> of contact with a woman&#039;s <em>valley</em> will leave a man<strong> LONGING</strong> for love.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattoc_g">mattoc_g</a>] 20-7-2006(139): The valley has something my life is lacking.... something I&#039;ve been<strong> longing</strong> for.. peace and quiet.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/konayuki">konayuki</a>] 23-9-2008(33): Imagine a young girl who has lived in this <em>valley</em> her whole life. She&#039;s looking out <em>yawning</em>. When confronted about it, she simply replies &quot;This is such a <em>valley of lack</em>! There&#039;s nothing to do here but <em>yawn</em>! I&#039;m<strong> longing</strong> to get out of here. I&#039;m<strong> longing</strong> for something more than just this <em>valley of lack</em>, this <em>valley of yawns</em>&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 24-7-2006(14): Nausicaa is<strong> longing</strong> to get back to the <em>valley</em> because she is homesick. She <em>lacks</em> her home.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shimouma">shimouma</a>] 26-4-2008(13): When I lived in the valley I spent all my time yawning - now I find myself<strong> longing</strong> to return.
