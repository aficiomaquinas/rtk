heisig: "The picture here is of a <b>street</b> sign on a long pole: Hollywood and Vine, if you please, or any <i>street</i> that immediately conjure sup the image of a <b>street</b> sign to you."
commen: "* Used as a primitive, we change the meaning of the key word and take the shape to signify a <i>nail</i> or a <i>spike</i>. Should it happen, on reviewing, that you find the pictographs get jumbled, then think of jerking a <i>street</i> sign out of the ground and using it as a <i>nail</i> to repair your garage roof."
