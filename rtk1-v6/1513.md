1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 7-2-2008(337): (Katsuo) You come at the zoo entrance. &#039;Here sir, a spoon to feed the animals.&#039; cool &#039;and a dart(gun) in case stuff go wrong&#039; ....&#039; please chop-seal (sign) here for in case of accidents the zoo is not responsible.&#039; &#039;lion feeding time is. bla bla&#039; You are having serious<strong> doubt</strong>s about if you still want to go into this zoo.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 21-12-2007(100): A very<strong> doubt</strong>ful story: At the entrance to my local zoo they issue you with a special <em>spoon</em> (to feed the animals) and a <em>dart</em> gun (to defend yourself in case of animal attack). You must then <em>hanko</em> (<em>seal</em>) a document to say you’ve received both these items, only after which will they let you enter the <em>zoo</em>. (Oh, and if you forget your hanko, I<strong> doubt</strong> they’ll let you in).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 9-6-2007(60): Unless they use <em>spoons</em> to feed and <em>darts</em> to subdue the animals, I<strong> doubt</strong> the new <em>zoo</em> will get the WWF <em>seal</em> of approval.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/diracbracket">diracbracket</a>] 9-1-2011(35): In her spare time ( = ヒマ), Gwen Stefani of &#039;No<strong> Doubt</strong>&#039; likes to throw <em>darts</em> at the critters in the <em>zoo</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 16-9-2009(22): Hmm... I<strong> doubt</strong> he is as busy as he claims to be. Yesterday, he looked like he had plenty of ヒマ (free time) - I saw him shooting darts and going to the zoo!
