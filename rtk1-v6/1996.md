1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 26-7-2007(271): Your <em>son</em> plays in the<strong> corridor</strong> pretending he&#039;s exploring a <em>cave</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep">pazustep</a>] 17-8-2008(39): A<strong> corridor</strong> is a bastard <em>son</em> of a <em>cave</em>. <strong>Corridors</strong> dream too, hoping one day they&#039;ll be as great as their father, the cave.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/takoman">takoman</a>] 18-6-2008(30): (ロウ) I think of the<strong> corridor</strong> found in the <em>cave</em> that Yoda made Luke Skywalker walk through as part of his Jedi training in Empire Strikes Back. It was in this<strong> corridor</strong> that Luke met Darth Vadar, cut off his head and found himself behind Darth Vadar&#039;s mask. An early little hint that Luke was Darth Vadar&#039;s <em>son</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 18-2-2008(26): When I hear<strong> corridor</strong>, I think of a long, lonely hospital<strong> corridor</strong>. Imagine a war scene. Bombs are dropping from overhead. The good <em>sons</em>, who defended the city walls, are dropping like flies. The wounded <em>sons</em> are taken to the underground bomb shelter and hospital, in a <em>cave</em>. There are too many wounded <em>sons</em> for the hospital, so the wounded lie sprawled in the<strong> corridor</strong>, as the cave is still rocked by overhead bombs.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36">laner36</a>] 5-11-2007(9): It would sure piss off superman if he found his <em>son</em> playing in the<strong> corridor</strong> pretending he&#039;s <em>batman</em>.
