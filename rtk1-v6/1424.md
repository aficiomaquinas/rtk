1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 21-9-2006(165): <strong>Hard up</strong> = nothing but your body, living in a hole, with just a bow to hunt for your food.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 28-8-2007(114): <strong>Somebody</strong> so <strong>hard up</strong> for cash, the volunteered to explore a <em>black hole</em> with nothing but a <em>bow</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 16-3-2008(54): Ok, picture a HOLE (well, more a pit trap) that SOMEBODY (well, a hunter with a BOW) just fell in. He&#039;s dangling over the HOLE holding onto his BOW across it. SOMEBODY finds it&#039;s HARD to get UP out of the HOLE. That great visual image should grant mastery of this kanji.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 4-6-2006(25): With the research to plug up a <em>black hole</em> going nowhere and funding slashed, (see <a href="../v4/1320.html">research</a> (#1320 究)), the team can not afford to launch any more probes due to the high cost of the fuel. <em>Somebody</em>, probably one of the<strong> hard up</strong> scientists desperately in need of more funding, tries using a <em>bow</em> to shoot a probe into the centre of the <em>block hole</em> -- and funnily enough it succeeds!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aaronvanvalen">aaronvanvalen</a>] 19-5-2009(22): A girl is so<strong> hard up</strong> for cash she lets <em>somebody</em> use her <em>hole</em> with a <em>bow</em>, it&#039;s a fetish-thing I guess; makes the guy hard and up.
