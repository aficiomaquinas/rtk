heisig: "Whatever one is particularly adept at - one's special &quot;<b>genius</b>&quot; - one can do very easily, &quot;with one finger&quot; as the phrase goes. This kanji is a pictograph of that one finger. Note how its distinctive form is created by writing the final stroke of the element for <i>fingers</i> backwards."
primit: "The primitive meaning, genie, derives from the roots of the word genius. Use the genie out in the open when the primitive appears to the right of or below its relative primitive; in that case it also keeps its same form. At the left, the form is altered to c, and the meaning becomes a genie in the bottle."

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 7-9-2006(24): I use Azumanga Daioh&#039;s Mihama Chiyo-chan for this. Not only is this character &quot;genius&quot;, but it is also the simplified &quot;years old&quot; counter, one which children use instead of 歳 . I can imagine Chiyo-chan saying: <a href="http://google.com/#q=「十才ですよ」">「十才ですよ」</a> &quot;I&#039;m ten years old.&quot; Ten-year-old<strong> genius</strong>? 十才天才 .

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matstc">matstc</a>] 8-2-2009(14): Once your marks reach ten out of ten, you need a stroke of<strong> genius</strong> to d0 better.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 15-11-2008(10): One form of Japanese honorific is to prefix a word with &#039;0&#039;. (although it&#039;s usually only used for objects not people, but in this case we can make an exception). So imagine Japanese people refering to the local<strong> genius</strong> as o-genius. This Kanji, especially in its written form, looks like a katakana &#039;o&#039;.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cormbit">Cormbit</a>] 15-2-2013(8): <strong>Genius</strong> is someone who impresses <em>ten</em> people with a <em>stroke</em> of brilliance, and makes them say &quot;Ooooo!!&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 8-9-2007(5): Most Italian religious painters utilize a <em>cross or crucifix</em> to move and inspire their audience. Leave it to the great Michelangelo to add a <strong>stoke of<strong> genius</strong></strong>-- the outstretched fingers of God and Adam (man)-- in his famous Sistine Chapel painting.
