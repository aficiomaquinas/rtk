1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 11-12-2009(73): <strong>Myself</strong> as used by men – a <em>person</em> who prides himself on how <em>big</em> his “<em>eel</em>” is.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 16-9-2007(30): &quot;I did it all by<strong> myself</strong>!&quot; <em>Mr T</em> stands there proud as holding a <em>moray eel</em> in his hand. He&#039;s brought down terrorist organisations, drug syndicates, but gets all worked up when catching a fish... what a guy.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 9-2-2007(24): As astridtops mentions, this is &quot;Ore&quot;. In Japanese r = l, so could write it &quot;Ole&quot;. So picture a bullfight with <em>person</em> as the matador and a <em>dachshund</em> replacing the bull. The crowd keep shouting &quot;Ole! (Ore)&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 11-8-2006(15): (note: this is the kanji for &#039;ore&#039;). &quot;I,<strong> myself</strong>, am the <em>person</em> who will kill the <em>Midgard Snake</em>&quot;, the god Thor bellows. Since he&#039;s not known for his politeness, you can see him using &#039;ore&#039; to refer to himself...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 25-6-2008(6): <em>Mr T</em> is unfortunately bragging a bit here - &quot;Myself? I have got a pretty big mini-<strong>myself</strong>. It&#039;s actually right around the size of a <em>moray eel</em>, sucka.&quot; And as opposed to the Japanese, who point to their noses to refer to their own<strong> myself</strong>, or cultures that point to their body, when <em>Mr T</em> wants to refer to his<strong> myself</strong>, he points to his <em>moray eel</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KristinHolly">KristinHolly</a>] 6-1-2009(5): Mr. T kept singing the song, &quot;All by<strong> myself</strong>, don&#039;t wanna be all by<strong> myself</strong> anymore . . .&quot; and a friendly dachshund felt sorry for him and followed him home. Mr. T doesn&#039;t like dachshunds, but it&#039;s too late now. (thanks nest0r).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 1-5-2006(4): Now this is probably going to work only for Finns, but... :-) Dachshund(mäyräkoira) is Finnish slang for a 12-pack of beer. Well, what do you think is the most appropriate pronoun for (person) holding a 12-pack of beer, if not 俺 (おれ)?

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cheesemaster64">Cheesemaster64</a>] 21-11-2009(3): 「<em>俺</em>が自分でやったからさぁ・・」と<em>ミスターT</em>が大きいな<em>蛇</em>を待ちながら言った.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 17-8-2011(2): 俺 , 俺等 =己等=おいら, 俺が俺がの連中 , 俺様 , 俺々詐欺 ( おれおれ詐欺 ), <a href="../v4/2058">myself</a> (#2058 俺) おれ, おいら ... Parts: 亻, 奄 <a href="../v4/2055">encompassing</a> (#2055 奄) (cf: 掩蔽 <a href="../v4/2057">shrouded</a> (#2057 掩)) ... Similar keywords: ..1. 自分 <a href="../v4/36">oneself</a> (#36 自) ..2. S for 己 <a href="../v4/525">self</a> (#525 己) ..3. 吾 <a href="../v4/17">I</a> (#17 吾), is like Roman Number &#039;I&#039; but 5 ..4. Ware/Waga 我 <a href="../v4/640">ego</a> (#640 我) ..5. Boku 僕 <a href="../v4/1794">me</a> (#1794 僕) ..6. Ore 俺 <a href="../v4/2058">myself</a> (#2058 俺) Only cocky guys say おれ, the kind of guys like Mr. T that want to show you their <em>Hot Dog</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anderslu">anderslu</a>] 9-8-2011(2): <em>Mr. T</em> has killed the <em>Midgard Snake</em>, and is now shouting: &quot;I killed this foo<strong> myself</strong>!&quot;.
