1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 11-12-2009(73): <strong>Myself</strong> as used by men – a <em>person</em> who prides himself on how <em>big</em> his “<em>eel</em>” is.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 16-9-2007(30): &quot;I did it all by<strong> myself</strong>!&quot; <em>Mr T</em> stands there proud as holding a <em>moray eel</em> in his hand. He&#039;s brought down terrorist organisations, drug syndicates, but gets all worked up when catching a fish... what a guy.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 9-2-2007(24): As astridtops mentions, this is &quot;Ore&quot;. In Japanese r = l, so could write it &quot;Ole&quot;. So picture a bullfight with <em>person</em> as the matador and a <em>dachshund</em> replacing the bull. The crowd keep shouting &quot;Ole! (Ore)&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 11-8-2006(15): (note: this is the kanji for &#039;ore&#039;). &quot;I,<strong> myself</strong>, am the <em>person</em> who will kill the <em>Midgard Snake</em>&quot;, the god Thor bellows. Since he&#039;s not known for his politeness, you can see him using &#039;ore&#039; to refer to himself...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 25-6-2008(6): <em>Mr T</em> is unfortunately bragging a bit here - &quot;Myself? I have got a pretty big mini-<strong>myself</strong>. It&#039;s actually right around the size of a <em>moray eel</em>, sucka.&quot; And as opposed to the Japanese, who point to their noses to refer to their own<strong> myself</strong>, or cultures that point to their body, when <em>Mr T</em> wants to refer to his<strong> myself</strong>, he points to his <em>moray eel</em>.
