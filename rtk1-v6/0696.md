1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Splatted">Splatted</a>] 8-6-2011(40): He quickly<strong> yank</strong>ed his <em>finger</em>s out of the <em>vase</em>. Maybe no one noticed the attempt to steal the cookies...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 11-5-2010(16): As well as the meaning of &#039;taking captive&#039;, this also means &#039;crush&#039; or &#039;batter&#039;. One also often sees it written in Chinese, with the meaning &quot;pull&quot;. (I think this is where 拉麺 comes from - &#039;drawn&#039; or perhaps &#039;flattened&#039; noodles.) My keyword is <strong>crush</strong> (I <strong>crushed</strong> my <em>fingers</em> trying to lift a heavy <em>vase</em>) but <strong>Ramen</strong> or the other common use for this kanji in Japanese, <strong>Latin</strong> (it&#039;s the abbreviation for the Latin language) would also be appropriate, as they help you learn the reading (ラ).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 17-1-2011(11): He<strong> yank</strong>ed his <em>finger</em> out of the <em>vase</em> upon discovering it had a venus fly trap in it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 25-12-2009(8): <strong>kidnapper</strong>: The kidnapper wraps his fingers around the vase and then smashes it on the kid’s head. They carry him away. He’s been kidnapped.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dakoina">Dakoina</a>] 2-9-2010(5): RTK supplement: <strong>yank</strong>: I <em>yank</em>ed with my <em>fingers</em> at my car&#039;s steering wheel to avoid hitting someone who was standing in the middle of the road carying a Ming <em>vase</em>. I ended up against a light pole. I was hoping that Chinese would still be intact, but the person got scared and let it fall down... in pieces...
