heisig: "The word <b>resemblance</b> should suggest, among other things, a son's <b>resemblance</b> to his father. A &quot;chip off the old block&quot; is the way we often put it, but the character is more simple. It speaks of a <i>little</i> bit of <i>flesh</i>."
commen: "* When used as a primitive, the sense of <i>resemblance</i> is replaced by that of <i>spark</i> or <i>candle</i>. (If you want an explanation: the kanji for <i>moon</i> also carries a secondary sense of <i>fire</i>, which we omitted because we are keeping that meaning for other primitives.)"
