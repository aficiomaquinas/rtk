1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 17-6-2008(202): This is the<strong> BOWL</strong> of an alchemist: see how he mixes <em>metals</em> in his<strong> bowl</strong>, as he follows the instructions from his <em>book</em>?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sannomiya">sannomiya</a>] 20-11-2006(66): If I was begging with a<strong> BOWL</strong>, I would want GOLD and BOOKS.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63">ashman63</a>] 31-3-2008(27): I actually picture a <em>book</em> made of <em>gold</em> that&#039;s been warped (due to the malleability of gold) so that it has a dent in the middle that can be used as a<strong> bowl</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 13-8-2007(23): This is a great way to learn a lot of knowledge in a little bit of time. You get a <em>metal</em><strong> bowl</strong> and throw in as many <em>books</em> as you can! Keep&#039;em coming! Once you have every book you can think of that you have read or want to read in that<strong> bowl</strong> grind&#039;em all up!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/applesuki">applesuki</a>] 13-12-2006(21): The winners of the super<strong> bowl</strong> get <em>gold</em> rings, while the losers just get a mention in the record <em>book</em>.
