heisig: "I know of an Indian religious sect which teaches that <b>enlightenment</b> is to be had by covering the eyes with one's index fingers, the ears with the thumbs, and the mouth with the little fingers. While these differ a bit from the <i>five holes</i> that we used to represent the &quot;<i>I</i>&quot; (frame 17), the idea of achieving a special <i>state of mind</i> by covering those five places can help you learn this kanji. You might try the position out while you are learning this character."

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 29-11-2008(40): Heisig&#039;s was so perfect, getting all that saliva in on my pinkies after having been caught by my mother doing some absolutely stupid sign while looking at a book has shown her that i&#039;ve reached enlightment too, she walked out. To be honest i would have rather been caught doing something less... obscure..
