primit: "arrow(strzala) Here we see a pictograph of a long and slightly warped arrow. By extending the short final stroke in both directions, you should see the arrowhead without any difficulty. The hook at the bottom represents the feathers at the butt end. When it serves as a semienclosure for other primitives, the first stroke is drawn longer, as we shall see in the following FRAMEs. [3]"
heisig: "Take <b>style</b> in its sense of some fashion design or model. Then let the element <i>arrow</i> and <i>craft</i> stand for the well-known <b>style</b> of shirts known as &quot;<i>Arrow</i> shirts&quot; because of the little <i>arrow</i> sewn on each one."
