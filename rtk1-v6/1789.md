1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 7-3-2007(251): Amazed at the <em>weight</em> of his <em>crotch</em>, they <strong>confer</strong>red every honor upon him. (Image: guy with his junk on a scale getting a medal pinned to his chest/around his neck/being knighted, etc.).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 7-3-2008(45): (This kanji stands for <strong>description</strong> in my kanji dictionary) &quot;At first, I thought it was <em>too little</em>, but soon became <em>too much</em>&quot;, is the <strong>description</strong> that my girlfriend gave of my <em>crotch</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christoph">Christoph</a>] 27-4-2007(27): When you<strong> confer</strong> <em>again</em> 又 , you<strong> confer</strong> <em>too much</em> 余 !

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 5-3-2007(17): When the fighter was weighed, the <em>scales spun wildly</em>. On closer inspection, it seems he is well-endowed and his <em>crotch</em> was pressing against the scales, adding vastly more amounts of weight. The judges then had to<strong> confer</strong> amongst themselves to consider what should be his real weight division.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 15-3-2007(14): Having honours<strong> confer</strong>red on him proved to be <em>too much</em>! He overbalanced, so instead of kneeling at the queen&#039;s feet, he somehow ended up sitting <em>cross-legged</em>.
