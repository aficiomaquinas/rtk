heisig: "This character is easiest remembered as a pictograph of a water lily floating on the surface of the water, which gives it its meaning of <b>even</b>. The fourth stroke represents the calm, smooth surface of a pond, and the final stroke the long stem of the plant reaching underwater."
commen: "* As a primitive, this kanji can keep its pictographic meaning of a <i>water lily</i>."

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 9-4-2008(28): The graph of an<strong> even</strong> function [f(x)] will be symmetrical over the y-axis, as this kanji appears to be.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 22-7-2009(19): This is<strong> even</strong> as in flat, level, smooth, calm (not like &quot;even if&quot; or &quot;even though&quot;).
