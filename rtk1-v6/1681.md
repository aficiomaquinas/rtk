Buy my<strong> products</strong>! Or else I&#039;ll take my own <em>life</em>&quot;! Man, that&#039;s selling on pressure.

You knwo that game in which you try to make a cliff-like structure STAND.</strong> We see the manufacturer of Jenga try to reintroduce a product into the market, called Jenga-Cell. A similar game except you try to build a cliff-like cellular structure(i.e life). Picture a bunch of kids pulling out certain cells and putting in cells each turn creates a new form of <em>life</em> Try keep in mind the connotation of &quot;creating life&quot; as this also means give-birth.
