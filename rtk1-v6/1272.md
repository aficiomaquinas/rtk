1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 26-12-2006(142): <em>Long ago</em> our ancestors <strong>set aside</strong> the use of fingers and began to use cutlery. (Raichu,11-7-2006) The way I remember it&#039;s 昔 <a href="../v4/1184">once upon a time</a> (#1184 昔) rather than 旧 <a href="../v4/35">olden times</a> (#35 旧) is that they began to use cutlery to eat <em>salad</em>. (I also think about how when you visit the Medieval Times theme park, which is set in <em>Once upon a time</em>, their gimmick is that you eat with your fingers.).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 8-2-2008(119): &quot;<em>Once upon a time</em>...&quot; Oh hell, you&#039;re just too old for this. You close your fairy tale book and set it aside, pushing it away with your <em>fingers</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 13-8-2007(53): To<strong> set aside</strong> in the sense of giving it up. We<strong> set aside</strong> childish things, namely, those ONCE UPON A TIME stories we grew up with-- though those stories&#039; faeries and Disney tinkerbells come up to us, we brush them away with our FINGERS, once after another, but they keep coming, not wanting to be<strong> set aside</strong>-- so we flick them away!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 27-4-2008(26): Once upon a time, I<strong> set aside</strong> my fingers and began using chopsticks. The rest is history.....no more sticky fingers.
