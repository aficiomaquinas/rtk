1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 7-4-2007(283): The BANNER warns that CHILDREN<strong> PLAY</strong> on the ROAD.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 19-2-2007(50): There is always a stupid <strong>banner</strong> talking about <strong>children</strong> at <em>play</em> near the <strong>road</strong>. They mean &quot;drive slowly&quot;, but it sounds like its slow(stupid) <strong>children</strong> that are at <em>play</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FarisB">FarisB</a>] 9-6-2009(38): No matter how many times we told them these CHILDREN keep<strong> PLAY</strong>ing in the middle of the road, so we put up a new BANNER: &quot;RUN EM DOWN&quot;, that scared the hell out of them... what? why are you looking at me like that?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 8-11-2005(20): A <em>banner</em> hangs over the <em>road</em> saying &quot;watch out for <em>children</em> at<strong> play</strong>&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xxinde">xxinde</a>] 30-3-2010(8): Seeing how drivers ignore the <em>road</em> signs that warn about<strong> play</strong>ng children, the parents took matters in their own hands by making the kids wear bright <em>banners</em> on their backs, much like Japanese medieval soldiers (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sashimono">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sashimono</a>).
