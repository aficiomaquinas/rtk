1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 16-6-2007(228): The yakuza boss reclines in the oaken bathtub wearing his shades while his personal harem<strong> dance</strong>s nakes for him.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 15-6-2008(120): I learned <a href="../v4/1775.html">nothingness</a> (#1775 無) first because it is a very common kanji. Probably easier to think of this kanji in that context. Attractive<strong> dance</strong>rs should<strong> dance</strong> wearing <strong>nothing</strong> but <strong>sunglasses</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 3-6-2007(18): I imagine this <em>big oaken tub</em> as being full of grapes being squashed by the feet of the vinyard owners. Each wearing <em>sunglasses</em> and doing that Russian arms crossed <em>dance</em> and squishing all the grapes.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spleenlol">spleenlol</a>] 8-6-2010(14): See <a href="../v4/1409.html">jump</a> (#1409 踊). Renamed this kanji <strong>interpretive<strong> dance</strong></strong>. (readapated thegeezer3) The yakuza boss reclines in the oaken bathtub wearing his タキ(tacky) <em>sunglasses</em> while his personal harem does an <strong>interpretive<strong> dance</strong></strong> for him.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 12-5-2012(13): Heisig, let&#039;s get this straight: NEW keywords: 曜 JUMP ex-<a href="../v4/1285.html">leap</a> (#1285 躍); 踊 <strong> DANCE</strong>=ODORI ex-<a href="../v4/1409.html">jump</a> (#1409 踊); 舞 KABUKI ex-<a href="../v4/1774.html">dance</a> (#1774 舞) (used in concepts related to<strong> dance</strong>, like stages, fluttering, etc.). So, KABUKI 歌舞伎 【かぶき】is the keyword here. STORY: We learn <a href="../v4/1775.html">nothingness</a> (#1775 無) first because it is a very common kanji. Then we go to see KABUKI en the EVENING wearing SUNGLASSES.
