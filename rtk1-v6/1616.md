primit: "ketchup One way American children learn to cope with food they are forced to eat against their will is to smother it with ketchup. We can see this depicted in the mouth with the flag over it (in this case, the Stars and Stripes), set alongside the element for spicy (all of which is not far removed from the original meaning it had as a character on its own: &quot;false&quot;). [13]"
heisig: "Ketchup . . . ground."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 2-3-2007(302): Did anyone else used to put <em>ketchup</em> packets on the <em>ground</em> and jump on them so they spattered on the <strong>wall</strong>?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saizen">saizen</a>] 4-1-2009(117): Primitive for <strong>Ketchup</strong>: When the taste is too <em>spicy</em> your <em>mouth</em> has basically given up trying to handle it ..or in other words raised the white <em>flag</em> of surrender. But unlike war , putting <strong>Ketchup</strong> on it will usually solve the problem. <strong>Wall</strong>(dingomick); Did anyone else used to put ketchup packets on the <em>ground</em> and jump on them so they spattered on the<strong> wall</strong>?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kokage">kokage</a>] 21-12-2010(23): Excited about kanji 1500?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 26-6-2008(21): The <strong>ketchup</strong> primitive has an even more saucy true meaning: <em>Flag</em> means buttocks, <em>mouth</em> means hole and <em>spicy</em> means penetrate...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 21-4-2008(14): Heisig mentions <em>ketchup</em>, which I remember by imagining that someone is wiping the <em>ketchup</em> from their <em>mouth</em> with a <em>flag</em>, keeping everyone <em>standing</em> on pins and <em>needles</em>, means <em>false</em> as a kanji. So: the <em>false</em><strong> wall</strong> led to a secret lair under<em>ground</em>.
