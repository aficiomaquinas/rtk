heisig: "This kanji is the 12th sign of the Chinese zodiac: the <b>sign of the hog</b>. It is best learned by thinking of an acorn-eating <b>hog</b> in connection with the primitive meaning given below."
commen: "* The <i>top hat</i> represents the external shape of the <i>acorn</i>, and the unusual but easily written complex of strokes beneath it (which you might also see as distortions of an <i>elbow</i> and <i>person</i>) stands for the mysterious secret whereby the <i>acorn</i> contains the oak tree in a nutshell."
