heisig: "Looking at the primitives, a <i>fireplace</i> and a <i>rice field</i>, we find the essential ingredients for a <b>farm</b>: a warm <i>hearth</i> to sit by at night, and a well-plowed <i>field</i> to grow one's crops in by day."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 30-7-2007(245): Many<strong> farm</strong>s are created by first setting FIRE over the land to clear the land for the FIELDS.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 16-7-2007(49): When creating a <strong>farm</strong>, the prospective <strong>farm</strong>er must first set <em>fire</em> to the forest to clear the ground. Only then can he plow the <em>fields</em>. <em>Fire</em> before <em>fields</em> to make a <strong>farm</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kashikoi">kashikoi</a>] 9-1-2009(45): This kanji actually makes a boatload of sense. In Japan, rice<strong> farm</strong>ers are constantly making little fires on their rice<strong> farm</strong>s burning up all the old stalks and things probably to be used as fertilizer. In moving to Japan, I found this practice to be very new and odd to me. So I would venture to guess that&#039;s exactly where this kanji comes from. If not, it certainly makes it really easy to remember.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 5-10-2008(14): Crap! the <em>field</em> in our neighbour&#039;s<strong> farm</strong> is on <em>fire</em>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johngwk">johngwk</a>] 23-6-2010(5): On a Japanese<strong> farm</strong>, <em>fire</em> is often set to the <em>rice</em> fields (after harvest).
