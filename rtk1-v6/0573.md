heisig: "This is not a <i>turtle</i> (See frame 250) but a <b>tortoise</b>, however you wish to picture the difference. Let the &quot;<i>bound up</i>&quot; at the to prefer to the head, and the two <i>suns</i>, with a long tail running through it, to the shell."
commen: "* As a primitive, this kanji is abbreviated to its bottom half, ⻲, and comes to mean <i>eel</i>. (If it is any help, this kanji in its full form can also be remembered through its abbreviation's primitive meaning.)"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 27-10-2007(219): It seems bizarre, but<strong> tortoise</strong>s are a genetic cross with the head of a fish and the tail of an eel. Where the shell comes from, no one knows.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skylarth">skylarth</a>] 15-6-2008(118): A<strong> tortoise</strong> is <em>prosperity</em> <em>bound up</em> with a <em>tail</em>. They are very lucky creatures.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elanlan">elanlan</a>] 18-4-2009(30): <strong>Tortoise</strong>s are known to live relatively long lives (it is not uncommon for them to exceed 100 years of age). Thus, a<strong> tortoise</strong> is a creature that is <em>bound</em> by its shell to see <em>many days</em>, with its little tail peeking out.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yuta73">Yuta73</a>] 20-11-2010(26): <strong>Tortoise</strong>. DBZ. This is goku&#039;s symbol in his back. How can I forget it!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 26-5-2010(9): [addition to dwhitman&#039;s] It seems bizarre, but<strong> tortoise</strong>s are a genetic cross with the head of a fish and the tail of an eel. They are the symbol of prosperity (stroke order).
