2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 16-1-2008(43): I like to recall<strong> commander</strong> in conjuntion with <em>expert.</em> Both are <em>maestros</em> with <em>towels</em> -- however, there is no upper limit (no <em>ceiling</em>) to what a<strong> commander</strong> can achieve in comparison to a mere expert.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 1-3-2006(42): The greatest of them all;<strong> Commander</strong> James Bond, 007. Here he is the <em>maestro</em> of undressing women, removing the <em>towel</em> from some bond girl. Of course the towel symbolises her last vestige of resistance.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dat5h">dat5h</a>] 22-6-2009(26): Here we see <em>James Bond</em> as the ultimate<strong> Commander</strong>. In fact you can see him <strong>command-her</strong> to take off that <em>towel</em> and it just falls off without a second thought.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thelooseteeth">thelooseteeth</a>] 15-3-2009(12): <em>Beyonce</em> make a controversial military <strong>commander</strong> as she goes into battle dressed only in a <em>towel</em>!
