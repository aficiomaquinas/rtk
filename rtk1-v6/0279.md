heisig: "An <b>emperor</b>, as we all know, is a ruler - something like a <i>king</i> but higher in status. The <i>white bird</i> perched above the <i>king</i>, elevating him to <b>imperial</b> heights, is the messenger he sends back and forth to the gods to request advice and special favors, something that <i>white birds</i> have long done in folklore throughout the world."
