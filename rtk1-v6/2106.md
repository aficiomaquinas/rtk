1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 15-6-2007(119): I was finally able to score an<strong> interview</strong> with the wisest being around: <em>Jiminy Cricket</em>. However, his schedule is really packed, so they had to squeeze me in while his tour bus rode between gigs. In fact, it was really short---after a few miles I was kicked out of the bus and stranded in the middle of the <em>interstate</em>. But man, it was worth it!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 17-4-2007(96): On the <em>road</em> to my <strong>interview</strong> I <em>accidentally</em> bump into <em>Jiminy Cricket</em> who gives me some good advice.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 5-1-2007(40): &quot;Interview&quot; is a bit of a stretch, as this means &quot;to meet accidentally&quot;. The place where person accidentally met the crickety fellow was on the road somewhere. It was, in a way, like a sudden<strong> interview</strong>: in both cases person just wants to get away fast.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 16-3-2009(19): I see Jiminy Cricket standing on the side of he road, holding out his thumb. &quot;Where are you going?&quot; I ask. &quot;To a job<strong> interview</strong>!&quot; he says. Even conscience&#039;s are losing their jobs lately!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey">onsen_monkey</a>] 12-9-2006(12): JIMINY CRICKET is on the ROAD doing a promotional tour. He&#039;s doing lots of impromptu<strong> INTERVIEW</strong>S, smoking lots of dope, and having lots of chance encounters with hot groupie bitches.
