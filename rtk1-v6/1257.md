4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 25-10-2005(41): Hint : As a primitive I use the image of Bender the robot from the animated series &quot;Futurama&quot; (by the same creator as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;). Here Bender is a<strong> cadet</strong> at the army, and the sergeant who is blinded by the sun reflected on Bender&#039;s metallic body, keeps saying &quot;this<strong> cadet</strong> is <em>one</em> -insert random expletive- <em>bend</em>er of the <em>sun</em>!&quot; (meaning Bender bends the sun&#039;s rays).

He had one task - blow up <em>one</em> <em>sun</em>. <em>One</em>. <em>Sun</em>. That they had set up for him beforehand. Well, he ended up blowing up the entire solar system his outfit was stationed in. When he got called in for a meeting, the commander said: &quot;Cadet <em>Bender</em>, you were asked to blow up <em>one</em> <em>sun</em>. At this rate, you&#039;ll never be more than a<strong> cadet</strong>&quot;. <em>Bender</em>: &quot;Screw this, I&#039;m outta here&quot;.
