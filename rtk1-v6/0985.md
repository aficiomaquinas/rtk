1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 22-12-2009(189): Can also mean bacteria.....imagine the <em>wheat pent in your fridge</em> growing to the point where they resemble <em>flowers</em>.......I actually had something similar happen to onions...they grew footlong legs after about 2 or 3 years......OR just think of that Cowboy Bebop episode with the lobster in the fridge... :-).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 18-4-2007(91): Actually it means<strong> germ</strong>s as in microorganisms. So for example, you have to keep wheat enclosed so it isn&#039;t exposed to other plants. That way it can&#039;t catch any<strong> germ</strong>s (like fungi) from them.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 15-6-2007(47): If you <em>pent in</em> the <em>wheat</em>, it&#039;ll turn into wheat<strong> germ</strong> and sprout <em>flowers</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 30-6-2008(44): Keep your <em>wheat pent in</em> an airtight container or it may catch <strong>germs</strong> and sprout <em>flowers</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 29-6-2008(21): A very logical kanji. Wheat<strong> germ</strong> is the &quot;heart&quot; of the kernel; on a wheat stalk, there is a <em>flower</em>ing spike or <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/909">ear (of a plant)</a> (#909 穂). The little <em>wheat</em><strong> germ</strong>s are <em>pent in</em>side of the seeds on the flowering ear.
