1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 19-7-2007(385): This <em>house</em> is reserved to<strong> V.I.P.</strong> only. If you are not <em>one of the few</em> with enough <em>money</em> to call you that way, keep out!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bendyarm">bendyarm</a>] 4-10-2007(51): The<strong> V.I.P.</strong> visits your <em>house</em>, but your <em>ceiling</em> is too low for his inflated head, which he bumps and hurts. You have to give him your <em>few</em> <em>shells</em> as compensation.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vicnet">vicnet</a>] 25-3-2010(31): HONEY! We&#039;ve got a V.I.P visiting tonight!! Let&#039;s decorate the <em>house</em> a little why don&#039;t we? That <em>ceiling</em> is boring, let&#039;s hang a <em>few</em> fancy <em>shells</em> up there, that&#039;ll impress them!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/GenPDP7">GenPDP7</a>] 20-12-2007(13): There&#039;s only <em>one</em><strong> V.I.P.</strong> in the <em>house</em>, and all I can do is <em>focus</em> on her <em>animal legs</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matstc">matstc</a>] 16-7-2008(8): If you are a <strong>VIP</strong>, you are the only <em>one</em> who can enter the <em>house</em> without paying the cover charge (a <em>few</em> <em>shells</em>).
