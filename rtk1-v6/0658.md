heisig: "<i>Tongue</i> . . . <i>nose</i> . . . <i>heart</i>. The sense of <i>breath</i> from the last frame should not be used; it could lead you to put only the <i>nose</i> over the <i>heart</i> and leave the <i>tongue</i> off to one side."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 1-3-2007(274): <strong>Recess</strong> to me is a school break. At<strong> recess</strong> some kiddies are comparing their latest body piercings. <em>Tongues</em> and <em>noses</em> are nothing special. The new cool is to have your <em>heart</em> done!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/strugglebunny">strugglebunny</a>] 17-11-2008(104): At<strong> recess</strong>, little boys stick their <em>tongues</em> out and pick their <em>noses</em> while little girls draw <em>hearts</em> on the ground with chalk. It&#039;s winter now, so any <em>tongues</em> --left-- out for too long will freeze.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 13-4-2008(96): Ah<strong> recess</strong>; <em>tongues</em> slandering, <em>noses</em> being turned up, and beneath it all, young <em>hearts</em> being broken. Dominant in playgrounds is the noise of <em>tongues</em>, which helps me remember that in this kanji <em>tongue</em> comes first.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johan">Johan</a>] 13-4-2006(52): The<strong> recess</strong> is a remote place for meditation. You sit meditating with other monks, breathing though your nose, holding your tongue (keeping quiet), and finding peace in your heart.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0">j0k0m0</a>] 2-6-2011(17): At<strong> recess</strong>...tongues flapping , noses running, hearts racing. wheeee! 休憩 きゅうけい　Imagine the skinny teacher from The Simpsons saying &quot;we&#039;re gonna have<strong> recess</strong> now children, nnnkay&quot;. けい.
