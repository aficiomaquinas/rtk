1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps">ceeeps</a>] 16-9-2007(161): When you put your <em>car</em> on the <em>road</em> you should always<strong> take along</strong> a few friends. Don&#039;t confuse with <a href="../v4/303.html">carry</a> (#303 運).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ji_suss">Ji_suss</a>] 24-8-2008(31): This kanji also means &quot;linked&quot; or &quot;series&quot; so I&#039;ve changed the kanji meaning to &quot;GO ALONG (WITH EACH OTHER).&quot; Well, a ROAD and a CAR certainly GO ALONG with each other. And the CAR will help you to GO ALONG the ROAD. This Kanji is the &quot;Union&quot; in Soviet Union and the &quot;United&quot; of United Nations (the countries that &quot;go along with each other&quot; at least some of the time).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 29-6-2009(20): The difference between <a href="../v4/289.html">transport</a> (#289 輸), <a href="../v4/287.html">take along</a> (#287 連) and <a href="../v4/303.html">carry</a> (#303 運)? <strong>Transport 輸 </strong>= when your car moves big items, like meat and sabers for that one butcher&#039;s hut. <strong>Take Along 連 </strong>= when you take a guest in your car on the road. <strong>Carry 運 </strong>= the luck you carry when the king&#039;s carriage is out on the road, tossing gold coins to bystanders.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mesqueeb">Mesqueeb</a>] 5-12-2008(9): [Borat] I want<strong> take along</strong> many garls in <em>pussymagnet</em> (=<em>car</em>) on my <em>road</em> back to Kazakstan.
