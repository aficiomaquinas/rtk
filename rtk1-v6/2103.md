1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey">onsen_monkey</a>] 12-9-2006(188): These bugs<strong> BELONG</strong> TO an extremist group promoting insect independence. They are parading the FLAG of their group, the Nationalist GNATS, and wearing explosives BELTS for their planned terrorist war.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 14-3-2008(133): [WARNING: violent story] Two teams of <strong>insects</strong> are playing “capture the <strong>flag</strong>” (ala Unreal Tournament). All of them wear ammunition <strong>belts</strong>. Here you try to take the <strong>flag</strong> of the opponent team, when you are faced by an <strong>insect</strong>: “You’ll get our <strong>flag</strong> over my dead body!”. You reply: “All your base are<strong> BELONG</strong> to us!”, shoot him on the head, take the <strong>flag</strong> and run away. See the <strong>drop</strong> of blood flowing from his head?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 29-6-2008(77): This kanji is often used like this: The frog<strong> BELONG</strong>S to the amphibian species. STORY: A scientist is trying to classify all the different INSECTS in the forest to find out which species they<strong> BELONG</strong> to. He does this by going from rock to rock, tree to tree, putting a FLAG where he already went, while taking INSECT sample DROPS (small insects/beetles look like DROPS) and DROPPING them into his BELT which is rigged with little jars.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fergal">fergal</a>] 25-11-2009(27): Great picture with a story: <a href="http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?pid=64390#p64390">http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?pid=64390#p64390</a>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 11-12-2007(27): &quot;You don&#039;t<strong> BELONG</strong> here!&quot;, cried the crowd to the stranger they tied to the FLAG pole with a BELT as swarms of GNATS ate at his flesh. &quot;You don&#039;t<strong> BELONG</strong> here!&quot; At that moment, the man began to believe them ^_^.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mistamark">mistamark</a>] 25-1-2009(15): &#039;All your <em>flag</em> are<strong> belong</strong> to us&#039; said the <em>gnat</em> with a <em>belt</em>!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 18-6-2006(5): A pack of <em>commando gnats</em> (thanks Immacolata) want to take over the property of <em>nationalist guy</em> (the <em>flag</em>) - &quot;ALL YOUR BASE ARE<strong> BELONG</strong> TO US ! HA HA HA HA HA&quot; (the engrish phrase that sparked an internet phenomenon). Of course <em>nationalist guy</em> won&#039;t let that happen - &quot;I<strong> belong</strong> here!!!&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/martie">martie</a>] 27-9-2010(4): This <em>FLAG</em><strong> BELONG</strong>S to the terror group called the <em>GNATS</em>, oftern seen wearing explosive <em>BELTS</em>. My opinion is they all<strong> BELONG</strong> in jail.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andresito">andresito</a>] 22-5-2009(4): An <em>insect</em> showing his <em>belt</em> and <em>flag</em> of the gang it <strong>belongs</strong> to.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 29-5-2013(3): Tired of being told he doesn&#039;t<strong> belong</strong>, this <em>insect</em> has made a decision. So raising his Tricolore <em>flag</em>, <em>dropping</em> a kepi on his head, opening his <em>mouth</em> to let out a big sigh and tightening his <em>belt</em>, the <em>insect</em> goes off to join the French Foreign Legion. Like so many before him, hoping he&#039;ll find somewhere to<strong> belong</strong> in the end...
