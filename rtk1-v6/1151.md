heisig: "The key word <b>shaku</b> has actually come into English in the word <i><b>shaku</b>hachi</i>, the ancient Japanese flute that measured &quot;one <b>shaku</b> and eight <i>sun</i>&quot; (the &quot;sun&quot; being about an inch in length). Since the <b>shaku</b> is about one foot in length, this makes about 20 inches. Let the final sweeping stroke be like a tape measure added to the <i>flag</i>."
commen: "* As a primitive, this will mean the <i>shakuhachi</i> flute."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jwy2k2">jwy2k2</a>] 6-5-2007(194): Slang for blowjob and that&#039;s priceless for stories...but also the character looks like the letter R which I think of as standing for RULER (12 inches) other meanings include: rule, measure, length.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 15-6-2009(65): Since this is SLANG for BLOW JOB and since it looks like an &quot;R&quot;, let&#039;s have the primitive be the R in BROW JOB. :).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brianobush">brianobush</a>] 8-5-2009(30): R-rated term for blowjob.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 16-2-2006(23): For the primitive meaning let the<strong> shaku</strong>hachi flute be the magic flute of yore. (Apparantly for a woman &#039;to play the<strong> shaku</strong>hachi&#039; is a euphamism for oral sex, if this helps with the character).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cornrow">cornrow</a>] 27-11-2008(8): Slang for blowjob... looks like a person with a giant mouth.
