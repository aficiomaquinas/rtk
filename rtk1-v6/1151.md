heisig: "The key word <b>shaku</b> has actually come into English in the word <i><b>shaku</b>hachi</i>, the ancient Japanese flute that measured &quot;one <b>shaku</b> and eight <i>sun</i>&quot; (the &quot;sun&quot; being about an inch in length). Since the <b>shaku</b> is about one foot in length, this makes about 20 inches. Let the final sweeping stroke be like a tape measure added to the <i>flag</i>."
primit: "As a primitive, this will mean the shakuhachi flute."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jwy2k2">jwy2k2</a>] 6-5-2007(194): Slang for blowjob and that&#039;s priceless for stories...but also the character looks like the letter R which I think of as standing for RULER (12 inches) other meanings include: rule, measure, length.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 15-6-2009(65): Since this is SLANG for BLOW JOB and since it looks like an &quot;R&quot;, let&#039;s have the primitive be the R in BROW JOB. :).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brianobush">brianobush</a>] 8-5-2009(30): R-rated term for blowjob.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 16-2-2006(23): For the primitive meaning let the<strong> shaku</strong>hachi flute be the magic flute of yore. (Apparantly for a woman &#039;to play the<strong> shaku</strong>hachi&#039; is a euphamism for oral sex, if this helps with the character).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cornrow">cornrow</a>] 27-11-2008(8): Slang for blowjob... looks like a person with a giant mouth.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 30-12-2006(7): This gets the primitive of &quot;blowjob&quot; since that&#039;s it&#039;s most common use outside being a measurement. Giving, receiving, watching, they&#039;ll all makes for memorable stories...

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tritonxg">tritonxg</a>] 6-1-2010(5): [FR]shaku japlt:non <strong>SHAKU</strong> k&amp;k 1895<em> drapeau+oblique droite</em> <strong>pictogramme en forme de &quot;R&quot;</strong> 尺を当てる 【しゃくをあてる】measure with a rule 尺地 【しゃくち】small plot of land 曲尺 【かねじゃく】common Japanese foot;regular<strong> shaku</strong>長尺【ちょうじゃく】long;lengthy 長尺映画 【ちょうじゃくえいが】long film 縮尺 【しゅくしゃく】reduced scale 尺八 【しゃくはち】bamboo flute (1shaku et 8 sun 寸 );(X)oral sex 一尺 【いっしゃく】30,303 cm.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 19-9-2006(5): <strong>Shaku</strong>hachi is also slang for blowjob...think of Heisig&#039;s story......hehe......20 inches....tape measure.....c&#039;mon I&#039;m sure you know what I&#039;m talking about!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 7-11-2012(3): <strong>Shaku</strong> is a unit of length equal to about 12 inches (just like a <strong>R</strong>uler), used in ancient Japan. See also <a href="../v4/45">measurement</a> (#45 寸). The<strong> shaku</strong>hachi is a flute about 20 inches long, which is supposed to be one<strong> shaku</strong> and eight suns, suns being about one inch long. The primitive meaning for this character will be <em>playing the<strong> shaku</strong>hachi</em>, meaning <em>blowjob</em>. (thanks all).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asayoru">Asayoru</a>] 29-10-2010(3): Since it looks like a person with a big mouth, and I want to remain somewhat civilized, I&#039;ll give this the primitive meaning of <strong>flute player</strong>.
