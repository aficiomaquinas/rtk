If they don&#039;t shut up, the Trojans will hear them...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 9-5-2006(76): Or more precisely: the team of horses are getting<strong> boisterous</strong> because one of them got bitten in the crotch by a horse fly. The kanji also means to roar, make up noise, to kick up a fuss and to make merry. Perhaps it is exactly the etymology behind this kanji.
