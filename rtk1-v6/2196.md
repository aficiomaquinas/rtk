1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 11-12-2006(215): How about a rusty<strong> cinnabar</strong> colored dilapidated boat, found abandoned somewhere. The smoke-stack and the keel have fallen off...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 9-9-2008(95): <strong>Rusty</strong> old <em>boat</em> with the bottom and top missing.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 25-6-2009(23): I always remember <strong>Cinnabar</strong> Island from Pokemon. Ash finds himself stranded on <strong>Cinnabar</strong> Island. He comes across an abandoned, <strong>rust-colored</strong> <a href="../v4/1868.html">boat</a> (#1868 舟) on the beach which is clearly falling apart: the smoke-stacka nd the keel have fallen off! (thanks ergerg).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 17-2-2007(23): Under a <em>glass canopy</em>, <em>one drop of</em><strong> cinnabar</strong> is shown to the young chemists.<strong> Cinnabar</strong> is a source of mercury and should not be exposed to the same air that we breathe.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 10-8-2007(10): Inspired by Philip K Dick (and Immacolata) - Stay inside the <em>Glass canopy</em> (Total Recall) and don&#039;t risk breathing <em>one drop</em> of Mars (the<strong> cinnabar</strong> planet) &quot;air&quot;. Also there is a milk factory near me called 丹那 （たんな）and we all know that they put various たんins (tanin makes me think of a <strong>rust colour</strong>) and other various chemicals into the milk we drink!
