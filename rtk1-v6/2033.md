heisig: "The technique for <b>sinking</b> used in this kanji is unique. Rather than the biblical image of tying a millstone about the victim's neck, here we see a <i>crown</i> tied about one <i>leg</i> before the unfortunate party is tossed into the <i>water</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jreaves">jreaves</a>] 20-7-2007(178): (thx geezer) The maimed waitress (no head and arms just her legs and trunk) is dropped into the water with a cement crown to make sure she<strong> sink</strong>s. She shouldn&#039;t have been so nosy about her yakuza-boyfriend&#039;s schemes.

Eureka!&quot; See <a href="http://math.nyu.edu/">http://math.nyu.edu/</a>~crorres/Archimedes/Crown/CrownIntro.html and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_%28word%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_%28word%29</a>.

The poor guy<strong> sink</strong>s to his death, unable to swim back up. Sunk by his <em>crown</em>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 14-10-2009(13): If you&#039;re in the <em>water</em> and your <em>legs are squeezed together inside a tight crown</em> you won&#039;t be able to swim properly - you&#039;ll just<strong> sink</strong>.
