heisig: "This character is now used chiefly in proper names, and is best learned as the character closest to the hiragana え, though in fact it has no relation to it."
commen: "* In order to give this kanji a more concrete meaning when it is used as a primitive element, think of it as referring to <i>building blocks</i> with the hiragana written on them, much the same as the A-B-C blocks you played with as a child."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 4-11-2007(292): <strong>Of</strong> all the kanji, this is the only one 之 orro can write.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 31-1-2008(110): The Z<strong> of</strong> Zorro (and yes he has a hat).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 7-2-2007(49): &quot;Hey Zorro, would you sign my chest?&quot; &quot;Why<strong> of</strong> course!&quot; Long story short: he didn&#039;t use a pen...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Groot">Groot</a>] 13-4-2010(16): The mark <strong>of</strong> 之 orro!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 31-1-2008(10): My kanji dictionaries state that this is an alternate kanji for これ (<strong>this one</strong>) ( 此れ being the other form). It looks like a very small <em>person</em> 人 who lifts a <em>hat</em> with his <em>arm</em>. I like to think<strong> of</strong> him as a <em>gardener</em> with a Panama Hat, but it could also be the almighty Zorro!
