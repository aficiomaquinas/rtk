1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 7-1-2007(184): Real meaning: &quot;to ponder&quot;. You have to think with<strong> prudence</strong> (ponder carefully) about approaching a tiger, as is evident from 虎 .

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei">javiergakusei</a>] 4-11-2007(127): You have to think with<strong> prudence</strong> about approaching a tiger. If not, it will eat your brains and heart. Thanks raulir.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 9-10-2007(16): Dear<strong> Prudence</strong>, <em>think</em> carefully before you come out to play with the <em>tiger</em> waiting for you ...I know it looks beautiful.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 17-8-2010(11): You are inside a tiger&#039;s stomach. In retrospect, you think maybe you shouldn&#039;t have poked the tiger with a stick. Some<strong> prudence</strong> would have been a good idea. P.S. I think this is a good keyword, as it most often appears in 遠慮 えんりょ which basically means restraint or<strong> prudence</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 28-8-2010(6): To <em>think</em> before approaching a <em>tiger</em> is mere<strong> prudence</strong>.
