1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bluestocking">bluestocking</a>] 18-9-2007(335): Behind closed DOORS, the TASKMASTER tortures to get prisoners to open their MOUTHS and<strong> DISCLOSE</strong> information.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 19-6-2007(62): You signed a non-<strong>disclosure</strong> agreement with the <em>taskmaster</em> but you opened your mouth as soon as you got out the <em>door</em>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 29-12-2007(31): It&#039;s best not to<strong> disclose</strong> what you were forced to do with your <em>mouth</em> behind closed <em>doors</em> for your <em>taskmaster</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 3-4-2010(15): Before they go out of the <em>door</em>, the <em>taskmaster</em> makes everyone sign non-<strong>disclosure</strong> forms to keep on top of the possibility that they might open their <em>mouths</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 18-10-2005(11): A closed <em>door</em> refuses to<strong> disclose</strong> (dis-close) whatever is happening behind, so someone asked the <em>taskmistress</em> to whip the <em>door</em>, and force it to reveal/disclose what is going on behind. The <em>door</em> gives up (who can resist the <em>taskmistress</em>, hehe) and<strong> disclose</strong>s the information by way of a <em>mouth</em> that appears, just like that (even in imaginary world, doors need a <em>mouth</em> to talk).
