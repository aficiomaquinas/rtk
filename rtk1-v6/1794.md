1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyland1">Hyland1</a>] 21-4-2007(323): We found a bundle of severed heads in your room, its difficult to<strong> trust</strong> you.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Angrybeez">Angrybeez</a>] 20-6-2008(28): Don&#039;t<strong> Trust</strong> the press just a <em>bundle</em> of lies on every <em>page</em>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 29-5-2007(26): [trust; request] Do you <strong>trust</strong> anything? Actually we do, as long as a <em>bundle</em> of <em>heads</em> say the same thing. If a <em>bundle</em> of scientist&#039;s <em>heads</em> say we live in a 12 dimensions universe, why should we not <strong>trust</strong> them?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 29-8-2009(12): Even though the stork didn&#039;t drop its <em>bundle</em> when it crashed into the tree, I still don&#039;t<strong> trust</strong> it to deliver any more babies - the one I got isn&#039;t right in the <em>head</em>. Must be a result of the stork-tree collision (see also <a href="../v4/1669.html">quick</a> (#1669 速)).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 28-2-2008(11): <a href="http://google.com/#q=頼む、たのむ">頼む、たのむ</a> Godzilla requested a bundle of heads. If we give it, he will spare the rest. Can we <strong>trust</strong> him?
