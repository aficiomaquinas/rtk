heisig: "Since it is very hard to read by the <i>fireplace</i> without going blind from the flickering of the flames or burning up from the heat, our ancestors invented a way to <i>nail</i> down a bit of that <i>fire</i>, just enough to light up the text of their evening newspapers and no more. Voilà! The <b>lamp</b>."
