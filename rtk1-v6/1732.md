Afraid of fraud and fighting among the gunslingers, the<strong> ballot</strong>s were posted into a slot in the top of the local church altar instead. They may have been rough, but the cowboys wouldn&#039;t fight in the church.

Teh first thing he does is to hold a vote &quot;But we dont have a<strong> ballot</strong> box&quot;. clint punches a hole in the altar and says &quot; you do now!&quot; (imagine him standing over the altar and punching down kinda like karata guy would).
