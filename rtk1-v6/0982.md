1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amthomas">amthomas</a>] 18-3-2007(596): <em>Word</em> and <em>Excel</em> somehow manage to<strong> entice</strong> people to use them, despite their plethora of bugs.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 22-12-2009(71): Think of the smooth talker who EXCELS at using WORDS to<strong> entice</strong> women (including married women if it makes it easier to remember).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethg">sethg</a>] 2-4-2009(32): I was<strong> entice</strong>d into Heisig, because Khatz tends to <em>say</em> your Japanese will <em>excel</em> after using it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Machine_Gun_Cat">Machine_Gun_Cat</a>] 15-4-2009(28): I imagine alot of the users of this site imagine themselves in the future as some sexy beast in Japan who <em>Excels</em> at speaking with japanese <em>Words</em> so much that their words alone are enough to<strong> Entice</strong> any Japanese girl.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 17-11-2008(23): This kanji actually means &quot;invite&quot; so think of it as enticing someone to attend something. This is a PR person, enticing everyone to attend an event. To be a good PR person, you would definitely need to <strong>excel</strong> with <strong>words</strong>. (Also, if you don&#039;t excel enough, you could get people drunk on beer(wheat) or hire the mob(fist) to get them to come to the event).
