1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod">PacifistGod</a>] 2-8-2007(155): After stopping a bank heist, Spiderman is seen<strong> winding</strong> his webbing around the stolen goods to trap them in a tree until the police arrive to take them back.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 28-2-2008(116): Tip: <em>goods</em> + <em>wood/tree</em> : This combination appears 4 times. I suggest calling it &quot;<em>furniture</em>&quot; (a common type of <em>wooden goods</em>). REF: <a href="../v4/215">parch</a> (#215 燥) , <a href="../v4/671">maneuver</a> (#671 操), <em>winding</em> (FRAME 1369), <a href="../v4/2035">seaweed</a> (#2035 藻). Story: You are<strong> winding</strong> up your new <em>furniture</em> using a <em>thread</em> to get it through the window of your high-rise apartment.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shaydwyrm">shaydwyrm</a>] 13-5-2008(81): <em>Spiderman</em> often accidentally breaks his <em>furniture</em> (thanks Katsuo!) with his spider strength, so he is often seen <strong>winding</strong> his webbing around various pieces to repair them.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 28-11-2009(41): Primary meaning of this kanji has to do with turning pages/leafing through a book so I focus on that meaning. Also taking the furniture suggestion from Katsuo about the primitive on the right and making it even more concrete by having it refer to IKEA. Here I see Spiderman reading an IKEA catalogue, he&#039;s lost in thought leafing through the pages.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 14-7-2008(21): <strong>Winding</strong> <em>thread</em> around <em>wood</em>en <em>goods</em> to ready them for safe transport.
