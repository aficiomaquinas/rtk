1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 30-4-2008(205): In Japan, the emperor is a<strong> bystander</strong> - he <em>stands on his crown</em> but can&#039;t really affect the <em>direction</em> of the country. (thx shimouma).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the_marshal">the_marshal</a>] 6-3-2006(132): Mr. T is in the street, standing up, wearing an golden crown and a compass in his hand... he&#039;s asking the<strong> bystander</strong> if they know how to get to buckingham palace (!).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Joyo1945">Joyo1945</a>] 6-1-2009(57): <em>Mr. T</em> is tired of being a<strong> bystander</strong>, he <em>stands up</em> and takes the king&#039;s <em>crown</em> for himself to change the <em>direction</em> of the country.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256">cjon256</a>] 1-5-2009(49): Side Note: The right side of this kanji is itself a kanji (but not a kanji given in Heisig) meaning &quot;The right hand side of a kanji&quot; (旁【つくり】). It can also mean &quot;at the same time.&quot; Not sure if this is useful, but it seemed interesting...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 28-5-2007(21): Many cultures have some traditional story about the <em>sovereign</em> who disguises himself as a peasant or traveler, a<strong> bystander</strong> if you will, to judge the moral <em>compass</em> of his <em>people</em>.
