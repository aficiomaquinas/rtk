1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 6-2-2007(174): Well, you usually use your <em>fingers</em> to<strong> throw</strong> objects used as <em>missile</em> weapons. Easy. By the way, for those of you looking for a less anachronistic image for the <em>missile</em> primitive as a modern rocket, try a slingshot. it&#039;s a <em>crotch</em> (originally a tree branch) that sends missile projectiles flying into/like the <em>wind</em>. And for this present kanji, it is something you naturally use with your fingers...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 11-8-2009(169): <strong>If you use the primitive &quot;semen&quot; (flying in the wind from your crotch) instead of missile then all kanjis with this primitive will hilariously create a perfect story</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RobMow">RobMow</a>] 19-8-2008(13): In Japan, where gun-control laws are strict, the desperate criminals have resorted to<strong> throw</strong>ing chopped-off <em>finger missiles</em> at each other.
