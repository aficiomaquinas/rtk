primit: "road The road envisioned here is a road for traffic, or a path or walkway. The natural sweep of these three simple strokes should be easy to remember, as it appears so often. [3]"
heisig: "The key word carries both the sense of a <b>road</b> for transit and a <b>way</b> or method of doing something, but the former is better for forming an image. The primitives read: the <i>neck</i> of a <i>road</i>. Think of a crowded <b>road-way</b> where traffic has come to a standstill - what we commonly refer to as a &quot;bottle<i>neck</i>.&quot;"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 5-2-2008(198): When we go out on the<strong> ROAD-WAY</strong>, we often risk our own <em>necks</em> (that&#039;s why I take the train! ).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/whistler11">whistler11</a>] 19-12-2005(39): Watch as a villianous fiend stretches a poor damsel&#039;s <em>neck</em> over a dusty <em>road</em>. Her ear pressed to the ground, she can hear the rumble of a carriage thundering down the roadway. Will the hero save her in time? Or will her <em>neck</em> be ground into the <em>road</em>, spilling it&#039;s precious contents into the dust?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 7-7-2008(30): Good keyword selection by Heisig: while the primitive on the left means <em>road</em>, the whole kanji also has the meaning of <strong>way</strong>, or &#039;tao (teaching)&#039;. Thus, road + way. (Check out the wikipedia article on the Chinese Philosophical concept of &quot;Tao&quot;: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao</a>. It&#039;s this character!).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix">kaminix</a>] 3-3-2008(26): I have a very abstract view for this one. Remember when the kanji for <a href="../v4/70.html">neck</a> (#70 首) was first introduced to us it was compared to a great moose head, cut off by it&#039;s <em>neck</em> and hung on the wall? As we all know, mooses have very long <em>necks</em>; if you imagine widening and stretching it a little you&#039;ll probably be able to picture yourself taking a stroll on the hairy &#039;<em>neck</em>-<strong><em>road</em>-way</strong>&#039; of the moose. It&#039;s a very abstract mnemonic, but I swear, I was not high when coming up with it!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 22-1-2008(13): You&#039;re going to break your <em>neck</em> on the <strong>road way</strong>!
