2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 20-1-2007(62): The cubans build a pipe to flood the USA. Castro just has to turn the<strong> valve</strong> on it, and USA is flooded. Suddenly, CIA agents tackle him from behind, grabbing both his arms. But <em>Castro</em> manages to open the<strong> valve</strong> with his <em>elbow</em>, by raising the <em>elbow</em> above his head. Success! USA is no more...
