heisig: "The character we learned for <i>fishing</i> (Frame 184) refers to the professional, net-casting industry, while the <b>angling</b> of this character refers to the sport. The odd thing is that your <b>angling</b> rod is a <i>golden</i> <i>ladle</i> which you are using to scoop <i>gold</i>fish out of a river."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 28-8-2007(152): All the people that go to the Japanese festivals to catch fish part time are suckers. Me? I&#039;m a pro. I bring a big-ass <strong>golden</strong> <strong>ladle</strong>. I&#039;m a true<strong> ANGLING</strong> professional.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcbainpc">mcbainpc</a>] 25-6-2008(90): The easiest<strong> angling</strong> is pulling <em>gold</em>fish out with a big <em>ladle</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977">mameha1977</a>] 17-10-2007(56): Imagine an effeminate Roman 2000 years ago<strong> angling</strong> with a <em>golden ladle</em> instead of a rod because it matches his eyes and hair better and it impresses the boys. (Why a Roman? Because &#039;angling&#039; is just the roman-derived way to say &#039;fishing&#039; - use this to distinguish fishing from<strong> angling</strong>.).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 18-8-2006(27): <strong>Angling</strong> is not fishing (avoid <a href="../v4/172">fishing</a> (#172 漁)). It is the art of bending <em>golden ladles</em> into lures which which you catch the fish. But the fish aren&#039;t that important (and do not appear in this kanji). only the <em>golden ladle</em> matters.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 17-9-2007(14): I use a <em>gold</em> <em>ladle</em> when I&#039;m<strong> angling</strong>, the golden reflection in the water draws the fish straight to it, who needs a hook and bait when you have this!
