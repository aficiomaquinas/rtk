heisig: "Between the <i>top hat</i> and the <i>scarf</i> you will see the character for <i>in</i> which is truncated at the bottom so as not to interfere with the <i>scarf</i>. You can think of this character forming as a pair with that of the former frame: there the <i>in</i> (the <i>walking stick</i> in the <i>mouth</i>) was set on its side; here it is set upright."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 17-7-2007(267): The guy from <a href="../v4/401">pathetic</a> (#401 哀) shared his<strong> inmost</strong> feelings with a girl and she rammed a <em>walking stick</em> down his throat. It ruptured his<strong> inmost</strong> organs.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 4-10-2007(59): Besides making money from acting like a dog (see decline), the <em>pathetic</em> man has risked his<strong> inmost</strong> internal organs by becoming a <em>cane</em> swallower!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-4-2007(45): I&#039;m going with 9 strokes: the magician pulled <em>10 scarves</em> from the <strong>inmost</strong> part of his <em>mouth</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 18-4-2008(35): <strong>Note</strong>: Incorrect stroke order and count in book. Is written <em>one</em>, <em>mouth</em>, <em>walking stick</em>, <em>scarf</em>, with 9 strokes. [It evolved from a combination of <em>garment</em> and <em>in</em> (meaning undergarments), so maybe it used to be written as described in the book...].

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 22-10-2008(11): The <em>pathetic</em> emo guy is always talking about his<strong> inmost</strong> feelings. Sometimes I want to shove a <em>walking stick</em> in his <em>mouth</em> to stop him talking.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spoonsman">spoonsman</a>] 18-2-2009(10): Japanese Wikipedia lists this as having 10 official strokes, however it says it&#039;s often written with 9. So either 9 or 10 is correct, take your pick. <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a>常用漢字一覧.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tornadic_Indignation">Tornadic_Indignation</a>] 28-7-2009(5): After pinning me to the ground, that nudist homosexual from <a href="../v4/401">pathetic</a> (#401 哀) and <a href="../v4/1890">decline</a> (#1890 衰) revealed himself to be an agent of the FBI who found out that I was the true perpetrator behind the attacks on Pearl Harbour, 9/11, and a billion other fun events. &quot;BUT THAT DOESN&#039;T EVEN MAKE ANY SENSE,&quot; I protest. &quot;I DON&#039;T CARE,&quot; the waste-of-American-tax-dollars guy bellows. He sticks some random <em>walking stick</em> down my throat, it enters my<strong> inmost</strong> organs, and I die.

He took the <em>walking stick</em> out of his mouth and used it to stand upright.
