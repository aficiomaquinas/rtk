heisig: "This character shows the typical <i>cloak</i> of <i>valley</i> folk, which, unlike the tailor-made, high-fashion overcoats of city folk, is loose-fitting and free-form. Hence the key word's meaning of <b>abundant</b>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 7-1-2008(325): Again using the fact that cleavage in Japanese is called &quot;<em>valley</em> of the chest&quot;: a woman with<strong> abundant</strong> cleavage tightly wraps up her bosom in a form-fitting <em>cloak</em>, but leaving her <em>valley</em> exposed. Another unforgettable image (thank you, thank you, I&#039;ll be here all week).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(115): Welcome to cloak-valley, the valley where everyone wears cloaks and every shop sells cloaks. Mnemonic : “cloaks are<strong> abundant</strong> in the valley”.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 16-3-2007(63): Elven <em>cloaks</em> are<strong> abundant</strong> in the <em>valley</em> of Rivendell.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep">pazustep</a>] 27-7-2008(39): She used a <em>cloak</em> to hide her<strong> abundant</strong> <em>valley</em> from prying eyes.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 10-5-2008(13): [+rtkrtk] It&#039;s said that cleavage actually looks like the cleavage of the rear end - in other words, it looks like a bun dent, or <strong>abundant</strong>. Imagine a magazine called<strong> abundant</strong> a-bun-dents, and the winter issue features pretty woman wearing nothing but a heavy trench coat, exposing her<strong> abundant</strong> a-bun-dents, featuring <em>Hidden Valley Ranch</em> seductively poured all over them. Gross, sure, but hey. Whatever works, right? I was having hella trouble with this one.
