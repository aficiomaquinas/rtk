heisig: "We use the Roman numeral II here to stress that this kanji is an older form of the kanji for <i>two</i>. Think of <i>two</i> arrows in a <i>quiver</i>, standing up like the numeral II."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD">PeterJD</a>] 20-1-2007(155): <strong>II</strong> (older form of writing 2). After shooting one arrow (the dash top left), I have 2 arrows left in my quiver (bottom left).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 1-12-2008(25): Once you have <em>two</em> old arrows left in your <em>quiver</em>, you better start running...!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Remember">Remember</a>] 30-8-2010(17): <strong>II</strong>: To remember this Roman numeral, give each soldier <em>I quiver</em> and<strong> II</strong> <em>arrows</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 6-7-2008(10): For some reason i&#039;m using the kanji for I to remember the<strong> II</strong> kanji. Its just Arrow + single stroke under the arms, there is no &#039;quiver&#039; stroke, why? because you dont need a quiver to hold ONE arrow. As a result of the above explanation for the old kanji for ONE (which is never used) you need a QUIVER to hold 2 Arrows. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%BC%8C">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%BC%8C</a> Thats the character for the old I incase you cant picture what im saying.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomusan">tomusan</a>] 16-2-2008(9): <strong>II</strong> Roman soldiers carry <em>two</em> <em>quivers.</em>.
