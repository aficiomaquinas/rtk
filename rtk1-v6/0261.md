heisig: "Despite the strong phonetic similarity, there will be no problem keeping the key word <b>special</b> distinct from the character we met earlier for <i>specialty</i> (Frame 47), since the latter has immediate connotations lacking in this kanji. Anyway, we shall let the key word of this frame refer to something in a <b>special</b> class all its own - like the sacred <i>cows</i> of India that wander freely without fear of being butchered and ground into hamburger. Even though the practice is originally a Hindu one, and in any case no longer followed among the majority of Japanese Buddhist monks, the Buddha's refusal to take the life of any sentient being makes it only fitting that the <i>cows</i> should be placed on the sacred grounds of a <i>Buddhist temple</i> in this kanji."

The sacred Hindu <em>cows</em> are<strong> special</strong> - they can wander around the <em>temple</em> without fear of becoming roast beef.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63">ashman63</a>] 31-3-2008(31): <em>Cow</em>s at a <em>Buddhist temple</em> are<strong> special</strong> - they are holy cows! Sadly a few days later I find the same <em>cow</em>s&#039; meat on<strong> special</strong> at the supermarket. Holy Cow, what have we done!?
