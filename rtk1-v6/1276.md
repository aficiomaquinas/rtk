1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 26-8-2007(287): The <em>commoners</em> are revolting! We must <strong>intercept</strong> them on the <em>road</em> before they reach the castle!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tuuli">tuuli</a>] 17-2-2008(78): If don&#039;t want your secret message to be<strong> intercept</strong>ed, make sure your deliveryman is dressed as a <em>commoner</em> while traveling on the <em>road</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 19-2-2007(23): Robin Hood was a <strong>commoner</strong>, but he still would routinely <em>intercept</em> the Sherriff of Nottingham on the road.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 9-4-2009(20): This keyword is dangerously similar to <a href="../v4/1160">apprehend</a> (#1160 逮). The idea of a &quot;road-block<strong> intercept</strong>ing&quot; people can&#039;t be used twice, so here&#039;s an alternative: The children from the local village (merely <em>commoners</em>) walked up to the overpass of the nearby <em>highway</em> and <strong>intercepted</strong> the communications of passing truckers using their little CB radio.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 16-4-2010(8): In Lord of the Rings, the COMMONERS are<strong> INTERCEPT</strong>ED on the ROAD to Helms Deep. Think of the scene where they attacked by the goblins.
