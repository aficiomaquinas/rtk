1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jasta">Jasta</a>] 8-11-2008(225): <em>Spiderman</em> doesn&#039;t have a single<strong> paper</strong> with his <em>family name</em> on it (because he doesn&#039;t want to reveal his identity).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 4-12-2005(79): I imagine a ridiculously expensive, and rather pointless, Japanese type of<strong> paper</strong> for writing letters, with one&#039;s <em>family name</em> woven in <em>fine thread</em> somewhere in a corner.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 1-5-2008(39): Spiderman regrets getting drunk last night. Peter Parker hands in his<strong> paper</strong> with the name Peter Spiderman--wrong family name. Oops!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 26-5-2010(16): <em>Spiderman</em> is very careful not to leave any piece of<strong> paper</strong> lying around with his <em>family name</em> on it (because he doesn&#039;t want to reveal his identity) .......[thanks Jasta].

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/randomkrazy">randomkrazy</a>] 7-3-2009(9): Peter Parker&#039;s original name was Peter<strong> Paper</strong>, but they decided to change it before the comic was released.
