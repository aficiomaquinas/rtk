1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 26-6-2008(252): In the bible, King Solomon&#039;s<strong> JUDGMENT</strong> was admired not by saying to cut the baby in HALF with the SWORD, but that it revealed who the true mother was.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jotun">jotun</a>] 1-6-2008(72): It takes good judgement to cut things in exactly half with a saber.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 25-4-2008(22): See book. Solomon made his<strong> judgment</strong> and decided to cut a baby in half with his saber. Good thing he found the real mom before that happened!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/errtu">errtu</a>] 3-2-2010(12): Heisig&#039;s story is perfect.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 16-7-2008(8): Judge Judy: &quot; You cut the couch in <em>half</em> with your <em>saber</em>. It doesn&#039;t matter if you did it by accident because you tripped with a <em>saber</em> in your hand. What were you doing carrying a <em>saber</em> anyway!<strong> Judgment</strong> for the plaintiff in the amount of 1000 dollars&quot;.
