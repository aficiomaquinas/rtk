This has been edited in response to being reported ...you can change &quot;hair&quot; to whatever extremity-ly long body part you like.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/forestsprite">forestsprite</a>] 30-9-2007(114): When you&#039;re cold, your<strong> RUB</strong> your FINGERS over your EXTREMITIES vigorously to warm up a bit. I&#039;d still rather go in for a warm fire and some hot cocoa, though.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samusam">samusam</a>] 18-9-2007(72): Picture Mr. Burn&#039;s<strong> rub</strong>bing the <em>extremities</em> of his <em>fingers</em> together and saying &quot;excellent...&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 21-5-2008(41): This is easy. What other <em>extremities</em> could you possibly use to<strong> RUB</strong> something? We use our <em>fingers</em>, of course. (I do appreciate the tendency to read perverted things into kanji, but sometimes a more logical approach is better).
