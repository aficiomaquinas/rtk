1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 27-6-2010(44): The witches <em>piggy bank</em> was cursed with a spell causing any thief who stole it&#039;s contents to fall ill. The <em>illness</em> would result in the victim being covered from head to toe in a mass of <strong>carbuncles</strong>. Crime doesn&#039;t pay!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asayoru">Asayoru</a>] 10-11-2010(19): <em>Caveman</em> has to open up his <em>piggy bank</em> to receive treatment for his monstrous <strong>carbuncle</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 25-1-2011(5): His <em>sickness</em> caused numerous<strong> carbuncle</strong>s, which when emptied by the doctors also emptied his <em>piggy bank</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Puchatek">Puchatek</a>] 9-8-2011(4): In this kanji the <em>Caveman</em> has a <em>piggy bank</em>-shaped<strong> carbuncle</strong> under his skin. Hmm, well, at least it looks kind of unique.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 2-6-2010(4): There goes the lonely miser, all covered in <strong>CARBUNCLE</strong>s. The local lore says that his hideous <em>ILLNESS</em> is divine retribution for his avarice: the <strong>CARBUNCLE</strong>s are said to be shaped like <em>PIGGY BANK</em>s!
