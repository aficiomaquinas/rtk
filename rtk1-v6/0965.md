1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 24-10-2007(327): An hourglass filled with <em>wheat</em> counts time. A <em>few</em> <em>wheat seeds</em> drop every<strong> second</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nmkohi">nmkohi</a>] 12-4-2006(121): I&#039;ll be with you soon... please wheat a few<strong> second</strong>s.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 14-4-2007(39): I first came across this kanji on my microwave, so; if you want to microwave <em>wheat</em>, it&#039;s important to remember only to set it for a <em>few</em><strong> second</strong>s. If it helps you can picture those wheat/bran bag things that you heat in the microwave and apply to muscle aches.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 2-12-2008(26): <em>Wheat</em> can be cooked in <em>a few</em> <strong>seconds</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xxinde">xxinde</a>] 30-3-2010(14): [thanks, vosmiura] An hourglass filled with <em>wheat</em> counts time. A <em>few</em> <em>wheat grains</em> drop every<strong> second</strong>. Why wheat, not rice? Because wheat grains are yellow, just like the sand in a regular hourglass.
