1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 21-1-2007(266): In order for the bank to<strong> lend</strong> you <em>money</em>, you need to put up some sort of collateral as a <em>substitute</em> for the <em>money</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 3-10-2007(65): The poor <em>substitute</em> teacher asks the class to<strong> lend</strong> him some <em>money</em> for the bus fare home.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 7-9-2007(21): Flash back a second...<em>Mr T</em> is still your <em>substitute</em> teacher. You realize you didn&#039;t bring any shells for lunch, and you ask your friend to<strong> lend</strong> you some <em>shells</em> for lunch money. He refuses, and you feel a bit embarrassed. <em>Mr T</em> quietly reaches into a sack (which they will cart him away on later) and discreetly hands it to you. &quot;I&#039;m just<strong> lend</strong>ing it to ya, foo! Stop that thanking jibba jabba.&quot; [trigger:<strong> lend</strong> me some lunch money].

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 28-10-2005(17): I pictured the &quot;<em>substitute shells</em>&quot; as semi-transparent, or ghostly money, symbolising how they only stand for money that you didn&#039;t have in the first place. -- &quot;lended <em>shells</em> are <em>substitute shells</em>&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/robertmyers">robertmyers</a>] 23-11-2011(13): When you<strong> lend</strong> money to someone, you are in essence substituting their money (or lack there of) with yours.
