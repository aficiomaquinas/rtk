heisig: "The key word is actually a formal metaphor meaning &quot;humble acceptance.&quot; Reading off the two primitive elements in the order of their writing, we have: <i>nail</i> . . . <i>head</i>. As in &quot;hitting the <i>nail</i> on the <i>head</i>.&quot; Now one presumes that most people can handle metaphors, but if you were to run into a dimwit working in a hardware store who only knew the literal meaning of things, and were to ask him, in your best Japanese, to <b>place on your head</b> a nail, he might miss the point and cause you considerable torment."

Why? Because each person who failed to say it as a child had a <em>nail</em> driven straight into that tender<strong> PLACE ON THE HEAD</strong> (i.e. the very top of the head). That&#039;s a lesson no one will forget!
