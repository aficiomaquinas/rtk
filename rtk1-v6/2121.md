1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 8-12-2006(279): In the <em>capital</em> they have been having hearings<strong> concerning</strong> bioethics and bioengineering they call as their first witness a <em>chihuahua</em> with <em>one human leg</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BigAmish">BigAmish</a>] 15-8-2008(58): Ahem...<strong>CONCERNING</strong> your recent science fair project, it was a <em>CAPITAL</em> idea, but the <em>CHIHUAHUA with a HUMAN LEG</em> is freaking out the other contestants!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 2-5-2009(44): Note: <a href="../v4/2087">understandably</a> (#2087 尤) In the capital, there are hearings<strong> concerning</strong> bioengineering. Understandably, the piece of evidence that those in attendance found most shocking was the chihuahua with a human leg. Adapted from taijuando&#039;s version.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tornadic_Indignation">Tornadic_Indignation</a>] 31-7-2009(17): OBVIOUSLY IT&#039;D BE<strong> CONCERNING</strong> IF SOME GUY CUT OFF ONE OF HIS CHIHUAHUA&#039;S LEGS AND TRADED IT WITH ONE OF HIS OWN AND THEN POSTED THE PICTURES ON SOME INTERNET FORUM USING ALL <em>CAPITAL</em> LETTERS LIKE THIS WHILE TYPING. I WOULD BE VERY MUCH AFRAID. YES.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 8-4-2007(11): In<strong> Concerning</strong> Hobbits, Tolkien writes about Hobbiton, which is sort of the <em>capital</em> of the Shire. Understandably, they keep chihuahuas as dogs, and one of them has a human leg. Magic, probably.
