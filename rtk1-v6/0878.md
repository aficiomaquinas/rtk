1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 3-11-2005(252): Ok, this is where knowing some Eastern culture comes in handy! In Japanese society, when someone dies they creamate the body and pick out the remaining bones with special chopsticks. In this case, they&#039;re out of chopsticks so they decide to use (gasp!) a spoon instead.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pacersfan218">pacersfan218</a>] 1-9-2007(108): Imagine the grim reaper (the bringer of<strong> death</strong>), carrying a <em>spoon</em> made of human <em>bones</em> instead of a scythe.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 3-2-2008(68): The Grim Reaper eats bones for breakfast (with a spoon).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Biene">Biene</a>] 28-4-2008(25): Remeber <strong>DEATH</strong> from Terry Pratchett&#039;s Discworld books? Now picture <em>bony</em> <strong>DEATH</strong> as he sits down (in the book &quot;Mort&quot;) in the restaurant together with his new apprentice to eat a bowl of hot curry with a <em>spoon</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peepiceek">peepiceek</a>] 20-7-2008(17): <em>One evening</em> I choked to<strong> death</strong> on a <em>spoon</em>. (Don&#039;t ask how I wrote this...).
