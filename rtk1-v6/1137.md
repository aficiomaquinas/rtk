1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 10-4-2009(206): NOTE: The most common use is in はく, meaning to put on<strong> footgear</strong>, rather than actual<strong> footgear</strong> itself. STORY: You are asleep in camp when you are woken up with news that the FLAG has fallen to the enemy. You quickly PUT ON YOUR<strong> FOOTGEAR</strong> and run off to RESTORE the FLAG.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 21-9-2006(105): You should never use a <em>flag</em> as a shoeshine cloth to <em>restore</em> your<strong> footgear</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 2-2-2006(76): The flag has fallen! To win the flag must be restored. Whomever has to run up on the hill to restore the flag needs good<strong> footgear</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 4-1-2010(16): After being embarassed at the olympics, the national track team wants to restore honor to their flag. So they hire Nike to create ultra futuristic<strong> footgear</strong> (think Michael Johnson&#039;s gold running shoes).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 13-5-2008(13): My friend&#039;s<strong> footgear</strong> had lost its shine after constant wear. He was drunk and all of a suddent got a &quot;brilliant&quot; idea to <em>restore</em> that &quot;wet look&quot; to his<strong> footgear</strong>. Yup, he <em>peed</em> all over them. Gotta love drunken ideas. ( I use &quot;pee&quot; for the &quot;flag&quot; primitive).
