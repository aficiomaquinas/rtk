The Coral <strong>Reef</strong>s are some of the most beautiful habitats in the world, full of color and life. However, recently due to overfishing, the <strong>reef</strong>s have been undergoing something called Coral Bleaching.

The color is gone and all you have left is bone-dry, white <em>rocky charred</em> stuff.
