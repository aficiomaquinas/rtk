3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruukukun">ruukukun</a>] 26-7-2010(28): You may be familiar with this unfortunate natural phenomenon. The Coral <strong>Reef</strong>s are some of the most beautiful habitats in the world, full of color and life. However, recently due to overfishing, the <strong>reef</strong>s have been undergoing something called Coral Bleaching. The algae dies off, and the sun <em>chars</em> the coral, leaving nothing but a barren wasteland that looks like <em>charred rock</em>. The color is gone and all you have left is bone-dry, white <em>rocky charred</em> stuff.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Clint">Clint</a>] 16-7-2008(14): This character illustrates ancient ideas about the origin of coral <strong>reefs</strong>. Although we now know that coral are in fact marine organisms, the ancients thought that <strong>reefs</strong> looked like a gigantic pile of <em>stones</em> that had been <em>charred</em>.
