1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 11-10-2008(65): If you find a <em>jewel</em> with the<strong> imperial seal</strong> on it, just <em>let it be</em>. You wouldn&#039;t want to be accused of stealing the royal family <em>jewels</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 14-12-2006(53): This aquatic mammal belongs to the emperor, so it&#039;s an <strong>imperial seal</strong>. Nobody is allowed to mess with it. They have to <em>let it be</em> wherever it wants to go. You can spot it from the other seals by the <em>jewel</em> studded collar around the neck of the <strong>imperial seal</strong>, but above all, remember to <em>let it be</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 1-5-2007(11): You might not like the<strong> imperial seal</strong> but the boss man designed it himself so it&#039;s a <em>jewel</em> that you should just <em>let be</em>. This is apparently the only 常用漢字 not included in RTK1.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 30-8-2006(10): The<strong> imperial seal</strong> is carved from a big <em>jewel</em>. The emperor uses it to seal new laws, while positioned over it, saying <em>&quot;Let it be&quot;</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 6-9-2011(2): 剣璽 , 璽符 , 御璽 , 国璽 , 玉璽 , <a href="../v4/2075">imperial seal</a> (#2075 璽)ジ( 爾 ) ... Parts: 爾 , 玉 (cf: 爾 <a href="../v4/2074">let it be</a> (#2074 爾), 彌生 /弥生<a href="../v4/2241">more and more</a> (#2241 弥)) ... Story: なんじ( 爾 ) is the imperial <em>Ball</em> at? My invitation with the <strong>Imperial Seal</strong> on it had the time written on it. But what with the <strong>Imperial Seal</strong> dripping on it, I no longer know なんじ it is at. Better to put なんじ on top next time.
