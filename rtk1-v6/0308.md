heisig: "People who try to sound literary often end up butchering the language. Here we see a <i>meeting</i> of <i>butchers</i> whose <i>mouths</i> are producing the <b>metaphors</b>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Themistoclaus">Themistoclaus</a>] 24-4-2011(51): <strong>Metaphor</strong>ically speaking, all the equipment in your <em>mouth</em> is basically just a <em>meeting of butchers</em>, designed to pulverize whatever meat you put in there.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 16-7-2010(18): <strong>Metaphor</strong>: A good <strong>metaphor</strong> flows from the <em>mouth</em> like the <em>meeting of flesh and saber</em>, smoothly piercing the listener with its meaning. But a bad <strong>metaphor</strong> is like when you barely nick the <em>flesh</em> and only spill <em>two drops</em> of blood or when your <em>saber</em> doesn&#039;t penetrate at all but rather bends into a くく shape when you whack the <em>flesh</em>. (Note: This story incorporates both the traditional form of the kanji ( <a href="midori://search?text=口＋兪">口＋兪</a> ) and the simplified form ( <a href="midori://search?text=口＋俞">口＋俞</a> )) .

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 24-11-2009(13): <strong>Metaphor</strong>: (Let this altered butcher primitive = <em>koo-koo butcher</em>, notice the kana くく). <em>Koo-koo butcher</em>s sell even the <em>mouth</em> of an animal and support their actions with crappy <strong>metaphors</strong> such as &quot;I ain&#039;t never meat the man who doesn&#039;t like his mouth.&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aaroncp">aaroncp</a>] 6-2-2011(11): A <em>meeting of butchers</em> is a perfect<strong> metaphor</strong> for the supposed secret talks(<em>mouth</em>) between Hitler and Stalin.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 7-11-2011(3): 喩え ( 例え ), 比喩 , 隠喩 , 暗喩 , 直喩 , <a href="../v4/3009.html">metaphor</a> (#3009 喩) ユ( 輸 ), たとえる, たとえ ... Parts: 口 , 兪/俞 (cf: 輸入 <a href="../v4/289.html">transport</a> (#289 輸), 真鍮 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/37742">Unicode-0x936e</a> (#37742 鍮)) ... Story: A <strong>Meat-aphor</strong> for modern times: What we put into our <em>mouths</em>, the dead flesh from a thousand <em>Koo-Koo Butchers</em>, is the cause of the that which comes out of those same mouths. We speak of nothing but death from our mouths, because we put nothing but death into our mouths.
