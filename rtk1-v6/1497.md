1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 31-1-2007(428): [instead; on the contrary; rather] <em>Gone</em> is the time for <em>stamps</em> - use e-mail <strong>instead</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 8-1-2010(47): We use e-mail now<strong> instead</strong> of regular mail. My e-mail is <em>gone</em> before you can even put a <em>stamp</em> on your snail mail.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wakela">Wakela</a>] 23-3-2007(18): If you tried to attach money to an envelope to pay for postage it would be GONE before it arrived at the post office. That&#039;s why we use STAMPS<strong> instead</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 16-2-2008(9): Having accidentally sent his children a home made sex video<strong> instead</strong> of the family Christmas tape, the man ran to the post office to switch packages. &quot;I&#039;m sorry sir, but your package was <em>gone</em> moments after you paid for the <em>stamp</em>.&quot;.
