1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 5-3-2007(214): The<strong> No.</strong> 1 currency in the world is the <em>dollar</em>. But, the Asian nations are fast catching up and may in reality have already surpassed it. So, let the <em>bamboo</em> represent the<strong> No.</strong> 2 currencies (the yen, etc.). The reverse order (<em>bamboo</em> on top and the <em>dollar</em> on the bottom) is really a look at the future.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/WithLoveFromExIA">WithLoveFromExIA</a>] 10-1-2009(101): The<strong> No.</strong>1 currency may at one time have been the dollar, but since the economic slowdown the <em>weak dollar</em> has been overtaken by currencies from <em>bamboo</em> growing countries. (Thanks to Johnnyltn for the idea.) Using the alternate writing of the dollar primitive as weak dollar.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 30-4-2008(63): <em>Bamboo</em> <em>bling</em> is the newest Asian Rapper,<strong> No.</strong> 1 on the charts right now.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 24-6-2007(19): The pole vaulter wants to be<strong> No.</strong> 1, so designs a <em>bamboo</em> pole with <em>dollar signs</em> painted on it. (The shape of a pole signifies this is the 1-stroke $).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 21-5-2007(15): Even in the <em>bamboo</em> forests of Southeast Asia, the <em>US Dollar</em> is the<strong> No.</strong> 1 currency in demand. (well, it is true of Cambodia at least).
