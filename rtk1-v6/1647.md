1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 2-9-2007(198): On the troical island of JOU, they<strong> brew</strong> <em>whiskey</em> while wearing <em>grass skirts</em> (top hats and scarves too). (Image: the strangely dresses islanders stirring a pot of<strong> brew</strong>. Careful <a href="../v4/1430">fermentation</a> (#1430 酵)).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 26-12-2006(79): To me, the grass skirt is composed of six celery sticks and a scarf. Apparently you can<strong> brew</strong> whiskey out of grass skirts. No wonder it tastes horrible.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 11-1-2007(66): Note : up to frame 1530, the kanji share the same chinese reading (JOU), so don&#039;t hesitate to group them into the same environment. Here we have the &quot;brew&quot;-man, who<strong> brew</strong>s some kind of <em>whiskey</em> using palm tree leaves. Instead of collecting them himself, he just buys the <em>grass skirts</em> from the people on this tropical island where he lives (which you may name the JOU island, after the chinese reading).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 10-1-2008(27): <strong>Grass Skirt</strong> primitive: Picture some Hawaiian girls, wearing <strong>grass skirts</strong> and tropical <em>scarfs</em> (or leis), doing a dance. &quot;3, 4, 5, <em>6</em> pick up all the <em>celery</em> sticks!&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alantin">alantin</a>] 5-7-2008(22): This<strong> brew</strong> of whiskey will cause you wear grass skirts and dance around like a maniac!
