heisig: "This primitive (named for its associations with the kanji of the following frame) is composed of a pair of <i>horns</i> growing out of a <i>brain</i> with a <i>tongue wagging in the mouth</i> beneath. Think of &quot;<b>former</b>&quot; in connection with administrators or heads of state who have just left office but continue to make a nuisance of themselves by advertising their opinions on public policy."
commen: "* The primitive meaning, <i>increase</i>, comes from the next frame. Always think of something multiplying wildly as you watch."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 15-2-2007(255): The Artist <strong>formerly</strong> Known as Prince has the <em>horniest</em> <em>brain</em> around, and I think you can imagine what his <em>wagging tongue</em> is doing...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/allanh">allanh</a>] 1-3-2009(236): <strong>Formerly</strong>, <em>horned</em> animals were used to plough the <em>ricefield</em>, and it took all <em>day</em>. Nowadays it&#039;s done by machine.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shadolite">shadolite</a>] 20-3-2008(70): The horns found in the ricefields were<strong> formerly</strong> used in rituals celebrating the sun goddess, amaterasu.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyreia">Hyreia</a>] 4-2-2009(62): I can&#039;t help but see this as the former president of the United Sates, George W. Bush. The horns growing out of his brain with an evil thought, his tongue wagging in his mouth, saying something stupid. (It helps later on. Increase = him increasing the national deficit until we have nothing but dirt left, Hate = Bush&#039;s mind). Fun stuff.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cricket">cricket</a>] 2-4-2008(21): This was<strong> formerly</strong> a human, but it has turned into a demon, with only jagged <em>horns</em> sticking out of its <em>brain</em> and a disgusting <em>wagging tongue</em> at the bottom.
