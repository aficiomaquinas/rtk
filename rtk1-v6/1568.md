1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bigloui">bigloui</a>] 29-3-2006(228): In the old days,<strong> salt</strong> was a worth alot, so it is not surprising to find someone <em>reclining</em> on the <em>ground</em>, <em>mouth</em> to <em>plate</em>, getting every last grain of that delicious<strong> salt</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Weber">Weber</a>] 21-2-2007(78): Remember the mock sushi documentary that circulated a while ago: &quot;Because some feel that the shoyu was not<strong> salt</strong>y enough, complementary<strong> salt</strong> dishes are provided on the ground outside the sushiya, you can recline and put as much as you desire in your mouth&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 12-11-2006(53): It is bad luck to spill<strong> salt</strong> on the <em>ground</em>, so you better <em>recline</em> and lick it into your <em>mouth</em> or put it back on the <em>dish</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joxn_costello">joxn_costello</a>] 12-1-2009(25): This is a picture of an artificial<strong> salt</strong> lick on the <em>grounds</em> of a nature preserve: animals can go there, <em>recline</em>, and use their <em>mouths</em> to lick the<strong> salt</strong> from a <em>dish</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 21-8-2010(10): In a<strong> SALT</strong> pan, all the <strong>soil</strong> is actually<strong> SALT</strong>. You can <strong>recline</strong>, taste it with your <strong>mouth</strong>, and put it in your <strong>dish</strong>. <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Salar_Uyuni_Bolivie.JPG/300px-Salar_Uyuni_Bolivie.JPG">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Salar_Uyuni_Bolivie.JPG/300px-Salar_Uyuni_Bolivie.JPG</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_pan_%28geology%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_pan_%28geology%29</a>.
