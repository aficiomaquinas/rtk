1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-3-2007(240): The <em>king</em> has eaten too much and has to get a new <em>belt</em> <strong>again</strong>. See his fat rolls hanging over?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 14-9-2006(93): This is a <em>belt</em> with a non-adjustable <em>jeweled</em> buckle. Everytime you go back to the leathersmith telling him to move the buckle because you&#039;ve packed on a few pounds (but that this is the last time!), he says &quot;Again?!? Weren&#039;t you just here last month?&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 1-5-2008(65): (I thought this was easier to remember as king with a belt) As the king gets fatter, his belt needs to be adjusted<strong> again</strong> and<strong> again</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 12-7-2009(19): I <em>craft</em> <em>yen</em> to buy things<strong> again</strong> and<strong> again</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 22-3-2007(10): Have <em>jewelled belts</em> come back into fashion<strong> again</strong>? I just can&#039;t keep up with the times!
