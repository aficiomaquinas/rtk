1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 25-5-2006(126): You know how missing childrens&#039; pictures often appear on milk cartons? Well here we have a missing hare. His concerned family is having his picture printed on the backs of receipts and even on stamps. So far, however, there has been no<strong> SIGN OF THE HARE</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 8-11-2007(118): <em>rabbit ears</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 10-9-2007(65): Identical to <em>egg</em>, without the &quot;yolks.&quot; Both hares and eggs are used for Spring celebrations because they are symbols of fertility.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSlakey">TheSlakey</a>] 8-1-2009(48): The<strong> sign of the hare</strong> is an Easter Bunny, with it&#039;s eggs that have no yoke (instead, they have candy).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 6-7-2006(9): In this version of the story of the &quot;Turtle and Rabbit Run a Race&quot;, the rabbit stops on his way to a shop where they sell <em>stamps</em>, just meters away from the finishing line. In the shop, the rabbit quickly forgets about time and spends hours looking at stamps, finally after choosing a good hundred <em>stamps</em> to buy, he receives a very long <em>receipt</em>, and pays for them. He leaves the shop with stamps in one hand and the receipt in the other, and you guessed it... the turle won the race.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DeKleft">DeKleft</a>] 9-12-2007(5): The reciepts and stamps don&#039;t have eggs spilled on them from the Easter bunny this year. It must be a<strong> sign of the hare</strong> who has changed his ways from evil to good. <a href="../v4/1422">egg</a> (#1422 卵) from Dingomiks in egg.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/EKeiko">EKeiko</a>] 25-1-2013(3): After dropping his <a href="../v4/1422">egg</a> (#1422 卵), the easter bunny runs away. So far there is no<strong> SIGN OF THE HARE</strong>. Wish we could tell him it&#039;s fine now... we found some clean <em>receipts</em> and <em>stamps</em> to replace the eggy ones.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Puchatek">Puchatek</a>] 8-7-2011(2): I just bought a <em>stamp</em> with a<strong> sign of the hare</strong> painted on it, and since it&#039;s very valuable I keep the <em>receipt</em> for it as well.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 4-1-2009(2): I chased the hare all the way up the <a href="../v4/1421">willow</a> (#1421 柳), but then the tree suddenly disappeared, along with any<strong> sign of the hare</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru">raseru</a>] 17-6-2008(2): If you eat the yoak out of your eggs, then it&#039;s a clear<strong> sign of the hare</strong>.
