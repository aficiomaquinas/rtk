2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vileru">vileru</a>] 8-1-2010(75): This kanji means a<strong> code</strong> of law, not a secret language or symbolic language (such as programming<strong> code</strong>) ... Story: The<strong> code</strong> of law is a <em>tool</em> used to <em>bend</em> citizens to society&#039;s will.

Here I see a<strong> code</strong>x as a <em>tool</em> used to <em>bend</em> the masses into submission. Picture a huge<strong> code</strong>x book lifted down on crowds to bend them down in submission. Another: if you <em>bend</em> to the<strong> code</strong> without asking questions, you are a <em>tool</em>!
