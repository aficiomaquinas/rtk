1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 17-7-2006(363): This character is the &quot;kei&quot; in &quot;keitai&quot; (cell phone), a word you will no doubt hear often in Japan, since everyone has one. Imagine you&#039;ve just arrived in Japan, but don&#039;t have a cell phone yet, so instead you&#039;re carrying around a<strong> portable</strong> turkey you can hold in your fist. To dial a number, just poke it with your fingers.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 5-4-2007(116): Because they have no <em>fingers</em>, <em>turkeys</em> must use their <em>fists</em> when dialing on a<strong> portable</strong> phone.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 22-6-2009(36): This character is the &quot;kei&quot; in &quot;keitai&quot; (cell phone), a word you will no doubt hear often in Japan, since everyone has one. I use my keitai with my FINGERS, like everyone, but if some TURKEY try to steal it, I don&#039;t hesitate to use my FIST .

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 8-8-2006(19): Some TURKEY has been sitting in the<strong> PORTABLE</strong> toilet forever. I pound my FIST on the door. Finally he comes out and gives me the FINGER.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terebijoke">terebijoke</a>] 16-2-2012(16): What do you do with your <strong>portable</strong> keitai? Play ANGRY BIRDS, of course! You use you <strong>fingers</strong> to drag the birds across the screen. How do you know these birds are angry? Just picture a <strong>turkey</strong> scowling and shaking his <strong>fist</strong> at you.
