1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 15-2-2008(167): Just one <em>drop</em> (of alcohol) and he starts walking in <em>zig-zags</em> – no wonder <em>Zorro</em>&#039;s living in<strong> destitution</strong>. (Note: As a primitive let 之 be <em>Zorro</em> or <em>Zig-Zag</em>: it&#039;s pictographic).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 22-2-2006(132): Children in complete<strong> destitution</strong> have no hope of ever getting toys to play with, so when they find even a tiny <em>drop</em> of a <em>building block</em> they are overjoyed.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 31-1-2008(54): The people living in<strong> destitution</strong> POOR. Zorro gives them every drop he has: drops of sweat while fighting, drops of blood when he is cut down,... even the senorita gets some drops.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 20-5-2008(24): <em>Zorro</em> helps prostitutes living in<strong> destitution</strong>. He gives them money, in return they allow him to cover them in <em>drops of Zorro</em>. What a philanthropist! (thanks filip!).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/digicult">digicult</a>] 15-6-2009(12): This is bad story, but whatever, it works, I was having real trouble with this kanji: On those Sunday morning World Vision shows you see African children living in total<strong> destitution</strong>, often wearing some wacky T-shirt that was popular in the West back in the 80&#039;s or something. Now see one little <strong>destitute</strong> child wearing a T-shirt that reads &quot;A Drop of Zorro.&quot; A <em>Drop of Zorro</em>? What the hell? I don&#039;t remember that movie!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavin.schultz-ohkubo">gavin.schultz-ohkubo</a>] 31-5-2010(10): Personal rant: This must be one of the most lame-ass kanji I&#039;ve seen. What were they thinking?!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sir_sanuk">sir_sanuk</a>] 13-1-2011(5): Just one <em>drop</em> (of alcohol) put <em>之orro</em> on the path to<strong> destitution</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 11-2-2010(5): Picture bedraggled, hungry and dirty children living in<strong> destitution</strong>...until <em>Zorro</em> <em>drop</em>s in.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Talka">Talka</a>] 8-9-2007(5): The peasants are a sensitive bunch when it comes to<strong> destitution</strong>. As they grow poorer, they note that Zorro has procured a new hat. Despite his being their hero and means to escape their<strong> destitution</strong>, the peasants begin to hate Zorro and his new fancy hat. How dare Zorro splurge like that while we wither away in<strong> destitution</strong>!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alatown">alatown</a>] 7-6-2010(3): <strong>Destitution</strong> forced <strong>Zoro</strong> to <strong>drop</strong> the whole masked crusader thing and get a real job!
