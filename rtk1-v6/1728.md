heisig: "To our way of counting directions, the <b>west</b> always comes fourth. So it is convenient to find the character for <i>four</i> in this kanji. But since we want only <i>one</i> of the <i>four</i> directions, the <b>west</b> adds the <i>one</i> at the top and sucks the <i>human legs</i> a bit out of their <i>mouth</i> in the process."
commen: "* As a primitive, the meaning of <i>west</i> can be expanded to refer to the <i>Old West</i> of cowboy-movie fame, just as the meaning of the character for <i>east</i> was expanded into <i>the East</i>. Note, however, that in its primitive form the <i>legs</i> are straightened out and reach down to the bottom of the <i>mouth</i>. Hence, we get the shape ⻃. With the exception of one kanji, given in the following frame, this element always appears at the top of its relative primitives."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog">guidedog</a>] 9-2-2007(224): The old<strong> west</strong> represented by a completely empty whiskey bottle (compare <a href="../v4/1427.html">sign of the bird</a> (#1427 酉) whiskey bottle about one third full).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 3-3-2008(49): Note: this kanji is also used to denote Spain.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 22-12-2008(25): The Spaghetti <strong>Western</strong> movies, typified by <em>empty bottles of whisky</em>, were so-called because it was often an Italian director that shot them. Most of these films however, were actually shot in <strong>Spain</strong> (another meaning this kanji holds).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/igordesu">igordesu</a>] 11-2-2009(21): Only <em>one</em> out of every <em>four</em><strong> west</strong>erns is worth watching. Even that&#039;s debatable. The rest are crap.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akatsukigui">akatsukigui</a>] 24-11-2010(14): <em>One</em> of the <em>four</em> directions: The<strong> West</strong>.
