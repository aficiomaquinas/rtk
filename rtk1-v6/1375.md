1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 20-12-2007(200): You can step a<strong> long-distance</strong> if you have a <em>leg</em> that&#039;s <em>gigantic</em>!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru">raseru</a>] 14-4-2008(117): You can step a<strong> long-distance</strong> if you have gigantic wooden legs (stilts).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 15-9-2007(34): <em>Capt Ahab</em> chases a <em>gigantic</em>, one-eyed (if you take Moby Dick a bit more literally), monster over a very<strong> long-distance</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 9-5-2007(33): Anything we might consider<strong> long-distance</strong> would be a truly <em>gigantic</em> distance for someone with a <em>wooden leg</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 16-3-2007(14): My ex-girlfriend suffered a car accident and had her leg amputated. Ever since the accident, she&#039;s been completely irrational. I had to break up with her, so I drove out a few states away and called her from a public phone. Naturally she flipped out, and out of nowhere came this <em>gigantic wooden leg</em> aimed straight at the telephone booth. Thankfully I jumped out before the leg pulverized the phone booth, but good thing I broke up with her with a<strong> long-distance</strong> call instead of in person.
