heisig: "When we hear the world <b>inlay</b>, we usually think of setting precious stones in pieces of jewelery, but the primitive elements here suggest <i>truth</i> being <b>inlaid</b> in the <i>soil</i>. You might think instead of the cosmic wisdom that <b>inlaid</b> the <i>truth</i> of the universe in the stuff of the earth."
