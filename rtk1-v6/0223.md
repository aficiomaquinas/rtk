heisig: "We need to fix imagination here on two things to learn the kanji for <b>desk</b>: the wonderful rough <i>wood</i> of which it has been hewn and the <i>wind</i> that blows across it, sending your papers flying all over the room. These two elements, written in that order, dictate how to write the character."
