1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 31-3-2008(241): The <strong>storehouse</strong> is <em>overgrown</em> with <em>slaves</em>. The <em>slaves</em> are to be sold in the store, to differentiate from a warehouse, which doesn&#039;t have the word &quot;store&quot; in it.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shimouma">shimouma</a>] 21-4-2008(96): Slaves moved flowers from the<strong> storehouse</strong> in preparation for the parade.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hknamida">hknamida</a>] 2-9-2007(44): For this story, I have chosen to use <em>overgrown</em> as an enclosure. The <em>slaves</em>, who are treated as objects rather than human beings, are denied the luxury of living in a proper house. Rather, they are stuffed in the <em>overgrown</em> <strong>storehouse</strong> with their owner&#039;s other possessions.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(23): Slaves are being paraded, decorated with flowers in a rather ironic attempt of making them look happy in order to attract buyers. After the parade they are put back into the<strong> storehouse</strong>. -<strong> STOREHOUSE</strong> (for temporary preservation), storeroom.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/imojyochu">imojyochu</a>] 24-8-2008(11): The Romans wearing <em>flower</em> garlands had a victory <em>parade</em> in which the captured Slaves were moved to a<strong> STOREHOUSE</strong>.
