1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 8-1-2006(329): <strong>Compensation</strong> is money you give to someone to shut them up (i.e. muzzle their mouth).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 3-2-2008(45): <strong>Compensation</strong> is a kind of euphemism for hush money here. Money that <em>muzzles</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jenelle">Jenelle</a>] 20-5-2008(34): I expect<strong> compensation</strong> for the bite I recieved when you didn&#039;t <em>muzzle</em> your dog.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akahige">akahige</a>] 30-1-2009(14): In &quot;compensated dating&quot;, Japanese girls earn <em>shells</em> from oyaji. The oyajis&#039; members <em>stand</em> at attention and the girls use their <em>mouths</em> to earn their<strong> compensation</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 12-4-2008(8): When I see this keyword I think of &#039;compensated dating&#039; (AKA enjo kosai). A man hands over his <em>money</em> to the girl and then <em>stands up</em>, and she then opens up her <em>mouth</em> to <strong>compensate</strong> him. If that girl&#039;s parents want to fix her problem, they are going to need to put a <em>muzzle</em> on her!
