heisig: "The <b>stocks</b> bought and sold on the market by the tens of millions each day get their name from a comparison to a healthy <i>tree</i>, in which one takes &quot;<b>stock</b>&quot; in the hopes that it will grow and produce more and more <i>trees</i> like itself. Usually good <b>stocks</b> are referred to as &quot;blue chip,&quot; but here we are asked to associate the key word with the color <i>vermilion</i>, perhaps because one can assess the value of a tree from the color of its autumn leaves."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cellophane">cellophane</a>] 12-10-2007(306): Which <em>tree</em> would you buy<strong> stocks</strong> in - the healthy one on the left, or the one with only one <em>vermilion</em> leaf left on the right?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 2-3-2007(145): Ideally, one buys<strong> stocks</strong> when a company is young, &quot;green,&quot; and rapidly growing -- then sells them just before the last vermillion leaf falls off, and a period of dormancy or limited growth begins.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shimouma">shimouma</a>] 27-3-2008(40): I have a hot tip for you. Buy<strong> stocks</strong> in a company called &quot;Tree and Vermillion Ltd&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CarlKenner">CarlKenner</a>] 7-7-2007(25): Don&#039;t think of the <strong>stock</strong>-market. Instead imagine the <em>wood</em>en medieval<strong> stocks</strong> used to hold a prisoner&#039;s head and hands between two blocks of <em>wood</em>. The <em>wood</em> in this case is <em>vermilion</em> coloured, as it often was. Imagine <strong>SHOO</strong>ING away the guards and blowing the<strong> stocks</strong> open with a big &quot;<strong>kaboo</strong>m&quot; sound. (ON reading SHU, Kun reading kabu).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oRis1024">oRis1024</a>] 24-7-2008(21): You buy<strong> stocks</strong> when they&#039;re new and green like a <em>normal tree</em> and sell it when it&#039;s <em>vermillion-HOT</em> and pricy.
