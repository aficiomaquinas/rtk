You know the film, don&#039;t you? It&#039;s no hollywood movie - it&#039;s true!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 30-5-2007(13): In summer, all of Japan turns<strong> green</strong> with the<strong> green</strong> <em>threads</em> that fan out like <em>brooms</em> to later produce <em>grains of rice</em>.
