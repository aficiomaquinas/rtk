1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 2-2-2006(165): A person <em>pent in</em> is obviously<strong> captured</strong>. Imagine a man put inside a wooden box, his evil capturers waiting for ransom money.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adhmm">adhmm</a>] 13-5-2008(122): Mr. T can&#039;t be<strong> captured</strong>. This kanji is lying.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 6-2-2007(27): They&#039;ve finally <em>pent in</em> <em>Mr. T</em>. But don&#039;t worry; no one can keep T<strong> captured</strong>, foo!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 14-10-2009(23): There is a butt<strong> captured</strong> within this picture. Lol!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/miyadamuraman">miyadamuraman</a>] 25-8-2011(15): This is a very easy kanji. A PERSON who is PENT IN is obviously<strong> captured</strong>. DO NOT USE MR. T! Why people are using this as a primitive element is beyond me. MR. T is the variant of person when it appears on the left side of a kanji. Do not confuse your PERSON and MR. T or you&#039;ll never know which one to use when you have a MR. T story. Keep each version of a primitive distinct in your naming. (Think of the difference between using &quot;heart&quot; and &quot;valentine&quot;).
