2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 14-1-2008(62): If you need <em>horseshoes</em> (shoes that fit your <em>horse</em>&#039;s <em>footprint</em>), buy them at the<strong> wholesale</strong> shop. They lick and paste <em>stamps</em> in your membership card so you can get free merchandise later.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 5-5-2009(28): A horse as a<strong> wholesale</strong>r: It <em>stamps</em> every contract with its <em>horse-footprint</em> (horseshoe) since it obviously can&#039;t write with its hooves.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SuzuBell">SuzuBell</a>] 18-2-2011(14): <strong>Wholesale</strong> refers to the sale of goods in quantity to retailers for resale. When this kanji was invented, large loads of goods needed to be transported by <em>horses</em> who left steep <em>footprints</em> because of the weight they carried. The<strong> wholesale</strong> goods needed a special <em>stamp</em> to indicate that they were legal for resale. See <a href="../v4/1398">honorable</a> (#1398 御).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 30-4-2007(13): At Costco you can buy horses<strong> wholesale</strong>. Just remember that they charge you by the size of the <em>horse&#039;s footprint</em>, and you need to bring your own <em>stamps</em> for delivery.
