1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 17-5-2008(246): The kids at school used to<strong> reject</strong> me.. Made me feel really bad till I brought my <em>axe</em> to school. See the <em>drop</em> of blood on it?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/khooks">khooks</a>] 3-9-2007(114): The quality expectations are very high in our <em>axe</em> manufacturing facility. If there&#039;s one <em>drop</em> of rust on any axe, it gets<strong> reject</strong>ed.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 11-4-2007(64): Gimli<strong> REJECT</strong>S an AX because it has a DROP of blood on it. Obviously the &quot;soul&quot; of the ax is not pure so he must<strong> REJECT</strong> IT.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 4-1-2009(35): This <em>axe</em> is a<strong> reject</strong> from the <em>axe</em> factory : a <em>drop</em> of red paint got onto the handle, which looks like a drop of blood. It freaks out customers, so it doesn&#039;t make it to the shops.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nadiatims">nadiatims</a>] 5-2-2008(19): My pawn shop<strong> reject</strong>s any axe with even a drop of blood.
