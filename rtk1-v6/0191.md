heisig: "When we speak of <b>burying</b> something (or someone, for that matter), we usually mean putting them under <i>ground</i>. Only here, we are <b>burying</b> our beloved <i>computer</i> that has served us so well these past years. Behind us a choir chants the &quot;Dies irae, dies illa&quot; and there is much wailing and grief among the bystanders as they pass by to shovel a little <i>dirt</i> into what will be its final resting place. R.I.P."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rowan">Rowan</a>] 21-9-2007(120): You can&#039;t<strong> bury</strong> computers underground, because of the dangerous heavy metals, so you hide them behind an equally large mound of soil and hope no-one notices.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta">Dualta</a>] 5-3-2008(80): I used SOIL to<strong> BURY</strong> my COMPUTER.

That&#039;s where I want to be laid to rest. 埋め込む (うめこむ) : to<strong> bury</strong>; 埋蔵 (まいぞう) : buried property, treasure trove.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 19-12-2007(31): If you assigned the meaning &quot;House of the Fathers&quot; to <a href="../v4/173.html">ri</a> (#173 里), this one becomes a lot easier. When I die, I want to be <strong>buried</strong> in these <em>grounds</em> so that my body can find rest at the <em>House of my fathers</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dhalprin">dhalprin</a>] 24-5-2010(18): When I die,<strong> bury</strong> me in the soil - next to my computer.
