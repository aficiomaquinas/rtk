heisig: "When we think of <b>focusing</b> on something, we usually take it in a metaphorical sense, though the literal sense is not far behind. It means to block out what is nonessential in order to fix our <i>eye</i> on a <i>few</i> important matters. The kanji suggests picking up a <i>few</i> things and holding them before one's <i>eye</i> in order to <b>focus</b> on them better."

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Xtophe">Xtophe</a>] 7-9-2006(41): Success (or survival?) method for accelerated juggling course: <em>focus</em> on a <em>few</em> nitroglycerine filled juggling balls flying OVER your <em>eyes</em> ---(I have trouble with this <em>few</em> primitive that can be anywhere in a kanji. To build in its location in the story is important somehow).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS">TerryS</a>] 27-5-2009(22): <em>Few</em> distractions will catch your <em>eye</em> if you have<strong> FOCUS</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr">stehr</a>] 30-9-2007(12): <em>few</em> people can<strong> focus</strong> their <em>eyes</em> perfectly, that is 20/20, the rest of us have to wear glasses because we see out of<strong> focus</strong>.
