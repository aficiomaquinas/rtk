heisig: "In order not to confuse the key word <b>perfect</b> with others nearly synonymous in meaning, pull it apart to have a look at its native Latin roots. <i>Per-factum</i> suggests something so &quot;thoroughly made or done&quot; that nothing more needs to be added to it. Now look at the kanji, which does something similar. We see a <i>house</i> that has been made <b>perfectly</b> from its <i>beginnings</i> in the foundation to the roof on the top. Now return to frame 101 and make sure not to confuse this key word with the kanji for <i>complete</i>."
