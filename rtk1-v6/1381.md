1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/trikatu">trikatu</a>] 28-2-2007(219): You have to watch your<strong> step</strong> when moving your <em>leg</em> on a <em>watery day</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 16-5-2007(80): So, we&#039;ve walked on the moon, but it&#039;s going to take a pirate with a <em>wooden leg</em>, with a huge supply of cooling <em>water</em> to land on the <em>sun</em> and take that &quot;one small<strong> step</strong> for a man&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wazato">wazato</a>] 5-11-2007(47): Use Floatingweed5&#039;s story, except, to remember the positioning of water and sun, picture the pirate pouring water into his mouth with a wagging tongue. How refreshing while doing his<strong> step</strong> aerobics.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Floatingweed5">Floatingweed5</a>] 10-10-2007(44): The peg leg pirate, wanting to get fit, signs up for some<strong> step</strong> aerobic classes. Here is is clutching his bottle of water and<strong> step</strong>ping up and down from his<strong> step</strong> platform in the island sunshine.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 23-11-2008(36): This is better remembered as &quot;step on&quot; or trample. I picture a puddle of water with the sun reflected in it (to get the water above sun positioning), then you<strong> step</strong> on the puddle with your foot to trample the image.
