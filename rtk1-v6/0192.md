heisig: "The primitives in this kanji show us <i>one</i> and <i>mouth</i> under a <i>hood</i>. Let us take the key word to connote the <b>sameness</b> that characterizes the life in community of the monk. They all have the <b>same</b> habits, including the &quot;habit&quot; they wear on their backs. Here we see the monk's <i>cowl</i>, drawn down over the eyes so that all you can see when you look at him is a <i>mouth</i>. But since monks also speak their prayers in common, it is but a short step to think of <i>one mouth</i> under a <i>hood</i> as the kanji for the <b>sameness</b> of monastic life."
commen: "* As a primitive, this will mean <i>monks</i> dressed in a common habit."
