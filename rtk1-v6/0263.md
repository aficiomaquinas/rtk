heisig: "Take this key word in its physical, not its temporal, sense (even though it refers to both). If you have a <i>cow</i> with <i>human legs</i>, as the elements show us here, it can only be because you have two people in a <i>cow</i>-suit. I always thought I'd prefer to be the one standing <b>before</b>, rather than the one that holds up the rear and becomes the &quot;butt&quot; of everyone's laughter."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijinda">gaijinda</a>] 20-10-2007(232): I&#039;ve never seen a <em>cow</em> with <em>human legs</em><strong> before</strong>!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 9-6-2008(158): Nasty story but it keeps the meaning true to the kanji. &quot;BEFORE you stick it in a COW and SPREAD the legs (the bottom stroke of this cow looks like two legs) make sure she has HUMAN LEGS&quot;-------------sorry, I&#039;ll remove if I get enough reports, but will keep if I get more stars.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LorenPaul">LorenPaul</a>] 28-7-2009(67): <strong>Before</strong> Human Beings Existed.. Minotaurs Ruled The Earth! Their Top Half A Cow And Their Bottom Half Human Legs! Also: Using Minotaur as a primitive can make stories a doddle!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 8-12-2007(65): I&#039;ve never seen a cow with human legs<strong> before</strong>! (from gaijinda) I keep mixing this up with <a href="../v4/290.html">in front</a> (#290 前). Remember that<strong> before</strong> sounds like &quot;beef or&quot;, so it must be the one with the cow in it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 7-12-2007(30): Note: If you are confusing &quot;before&quot; 先 with &quot;in front&quot; 前 , then note that &quot;before&quot; sounds like &quot;<strong>beef</strong> or&quot;, so that must be the one with the <em>cow</em> in it.
