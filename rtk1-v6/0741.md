heisig: "This pictograph of a clenched fist is another of the &quot;hand primitives.&quot; Take note of its rather peculiar drawing. Try to think of drawing a <i>fist</i> (the primitive meaning) &quot;<b>from</b>&quot; this character to give yourself a connotation for the otherwise abstract key word."
commen: "* The primitive meaning is taken from the pictograph: a <i>fist</i>."
