1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 16-3-2007(188): After worshipping the <em>golden calf</em>, God sent the Jews on a long <em>road</em> through the wilderness.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 28-3-2008(92): The problem with the &quot;gold calf&quot; primitive is that the first vertical stroke of &quot;heavenly&quot; is shorter than the second stroke. But as we know, &quot;heavenly&quot; clearly has the FIRST stroke longer, not the second. The primitives we really have here are &quot;animal horns (first 3 strokes)&quot; and &quot;big/dog (last 3 strokes).&quot; What are the BIGGEST ANIMAL HORNS that you can think of? For me its a MASTODON. STORY: In caveman times, you SENT OFF packages with the MASTODON express.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-7-2009(28): I couldn&#039;t stand the <em>horny St. Bernard</em> any longer, so I <strong>escorted</strong> it to the <em>road</em> and gave it a<strong> send off</strong> to go get neutered.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 22-5-2008(14): (note: I changed golden calf to Satan: came from heaven and grew horns) Satan was escorted by Michael during his<strong> send off</strong> down the roads of heaven.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/slats70">slats70</a>] 10-4-2009(12): Primitive: Animal horns + big =<em> Wooly Mammoth</em>. Story:There was a big<strong> send off</strong> for <em>Wooly mammoth</em> and all his friends waved goodbye as he left down the <em>road</em>.
