1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ghinzdra">ghinzdra</a>] 16-2-2008(235): White<strong> mount</strong> , Fuji<strong> mount</strong> , olympus<strong> mount</strong> whatever ....The choice is yours but wherever you go they sell those snowglobe souvenir : under a GLASS HOOD you can see the<strong> mount</strong> with a MOUTAIN GOAT standing on top of it .... So kitsch you just can&#039;t forget it .

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brose">brose</a>] 22-3-2007(50): Note: Stroke order is belt..horns..mountain, not the same as <em>mountain goat</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 5-1-2007(39): This has the same meaning as 丘 , so my &quot;Mount&quot; is a hill with<strong> mount</strong>ain goats on it under a glass canopy. It&#039;s obviously an effort by the locals to add some<strong> Mount</strong> atmosphere to their hill. As a primitive, it has the meaning &quot;sturdy&quot; (really), which Heisig has not used for some reason, but I will. The glass canopy must be pretty sturdy to keep the goats inside (bulletproof glass, I&#039;m sure).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 31-3-2008(17): Goat + belt = <em>S&amp;M goat</em>. Don&#039;t think too much on the image or you&#039;ll regret it forever. The goat loves the <strong>mount</strong> and it also loves to <strong>mount</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 7-5-2006(13): My<strong> Mount</strong> is the<strong> Mount</strong> in Dun Morogh where the dwarven capital of Ironforge nestles inside. At the gates to Ironforge you see a bronze<strong> mount</strong>ain goat guarding the entrance, in glass canopy for visitors to watch. This particular goat is the first goat of king Magni Bronzebeard.
