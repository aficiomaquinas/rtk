1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 17-7-2006(331): In the male-dominated world of yesterday, the husband&#039;s way of seeing things was considered the<strong> standard</strong> point of view. Women who dared to disagree were frowned upon.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 26-10-2007(58): Unfortunately, Homer Simpson is the<strong> standard</strong> model of a husband in American society. (Placement: You have to <em>look</em> in the RIGHT places to find one that doesn&#039;t fit that mold.).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rodders">rodders</a>] 15-10-2009(41): <em>Husbands</em> that still <em>look</em> (at beautiful women, at porn) are the<strong> standard</strong>. Those that don&#039;t are either saints and martyrs, asexual or blind.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 1-12-2007(29): Ugh. You can tell what her<strong> standard</strong>s are just by <em>seeing</em> her <em>husband</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 7-4-2009(16): The<strong> standard</strong> <em>husband</em> does a lot of <em>watching</em>, when the wife is NOT <em>watching</em> that is!
