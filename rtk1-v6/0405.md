heisig: "&quot;A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,&quot; says the Chinese proverb. Here we see <i>one footprint</i>, complementing that proverb with the sound advice that if the first step is not made <b>correctly</b>, the whole point of the journey will be forfeited. This is the ideal that teachers are supposed to have in <b>correcting</b> their students, and parents in <b>correcting</b> their children."
