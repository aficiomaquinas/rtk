heisig: "This kanji is a pictograph of a <b>child</b> wrapped up in one of those handy cocoons that Japanese mothers fix to their backs to carry around young <b>children</b> who cannot get around by themselves. The first stroke is like a wee head popping out for air; the second shows the body and legs all wrapped up; and the final stroke shows the arms sticking out to cling to the mother's neck."
commen: "* As a primitive, the meaning of <i>child</i> is retained, though you might imagine a little older <i>child</i>, able to run around and get into more mischief."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lbphenom">lbphenom</a>] 12-1-2008(43): A<strong> child</strong> who is <em>ten</em> will still ask for his <em>ma</em> (top looks a bit like katakana ma).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 28-1-2008(30): A pictograph of a<strong> child</strong>, with arms outstretched for mother (or perhaps because she is chasing a rat?). Note that this kanji occupies the first space on the Zodiac circle, and is the sign for the rat (such as 2008!).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Po0py">Po0py</a>] 15-12-2008(21): A ten year old<strong> child</strong> with a baseball cap.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jeromin">Jeromin</a>] 21-12-2008(9): A<strong> child</strong>, from one to ten, before becoming a teen.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NyahK">NyahK</a>] 6-6-2010(6): I&#039;d imagine most people knew this long before starting RTK. When they were still a <strong>child</strong> of kanji, perhaps?
