1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod">PacifistGod</a>] 27-4-2007(261): A<strong> sack</strong> is an easy substitute for a garment.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 18-10-2005(44): A worker who was recently<strong> sack</strong>ed from his job, is wearing a<strong> sack</strong> of potatoes as a <em>substitute garment</em> (naked otherwise), in some kind of protest. The kanji is close to frame 1547 &quot;bag&quot;, and although the later really refers to a &quot;straw<strong> sack</strong>&quot;, I use the image of a<strong> sack</strong> of potatoes here, and that of a &quot;plastic bag&quot; for frame 1547. The keywords would have been better swapped in my opinion, but the relevancy is not so important at this point (see notes of Lesson 31 in the book).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 23-8-2007(30): If you&#039;re super poor, you can <em>substitute</em> a potato <strong>sack</strong> for normal <em>garments</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/unicornpuddlefoot">unicornpuddlefoot</a>] 7-12-2008(11): When my clothes went missing I found a quick substitute - a<strong> sack</strong>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 8-8-2009(10): A<strong> sack</strong> can be used as a <em>substitute</em> <em>garment</em>.
