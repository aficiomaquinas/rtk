heisig: "Folklore throughout the world tells us of talking animals who show a wisdom superior to that of human beings, and that same tradition has found its way into television shows and cartoons right into our own century. This character depicts <b>revelation</b> through the <i>mouth</i> of a <i>cow</i>, suggesting oracular utterances about truths hidden to human intelligence."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pageturner1988">pageturner1988</a>] 18-9-2007(412): The<strong> revelation</strong> makes the cow&#039;s mouth drop down, &quot;Hamburgers are made of what?!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen">Ningen</a>] 6-9-2008(29): In ancient times, the words from a <em>primitive cow&#039;s mouth</em> were considered a<strong> REVELATION</strong> because they were the &quot;udder truth.&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 18-8-2007(23): When you get a<strong> revelation</strong>, you may <em>drop</em> to the <em>ground</em> with your <em>mouth</em> wide open.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 20-9-2008(17): Ask an enlightened Zen monk for a single word of<strong> revelation</strong>, then go and ask any cow for the same thing. You&quot;ll probably get the same answer-- &quot;Muuuuu!&quot; Spiritual<strong> revelation</strong> coming out of the mouth of a cow.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 5-10-2007(16): The<strong> revelation</strong> makes the <em>cow</em>&#039;s <em>mouth</em> drop open. &quot;Hamburgers are made of <em>what</em>?&quot; Think of a Gary Larson cartoon. (Slight tweak of pageturner&#039;s).
