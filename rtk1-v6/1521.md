2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 29-1-2008(139): For the primitive: This is a hi-tech Japanese <em>mailbox</em>, it automatically lights up in the <em>evening</em>, and has a biometric <em>fingerprint</em> scanner. --- Each <em>house</em>&#039;s<strong> address</strong>, even if it&#039;s hard to see in the <em>evening</em>, is like its own unique <em>fingerprint</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 6-6-2007(30): Mailbox - i never get my evening paper but the paperboy says he delivers it. so here i am dustin gfor fingerprints everyevening checking for his new prints . roof and mailbox. superman is the newpostamn so the local people write their<strong> address</strong>es on their rooftops as well as their mailboxes.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ghinzdra">ghinzdra</a>] 5-6-2008(21): Nowadays when you&#039;re asked your adress it has a double meaning : it&#039;s your HOUSE and your EMAIL BOX. N.B for the primitive mailbox : when you come back at home in the evening first thing you do is checking your mailbox and for that you need to give a fingerprint as your computer is locked.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 30-1-2008(12): When you send a letter you write the<strong> address</strong> of the <em>house</em> but it actually gets delivered to the <em>mailbox</em>.
