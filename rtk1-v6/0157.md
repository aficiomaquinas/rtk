heisig: "The character in this frame represents a step up from the <i>stream</i> we met in Frame 134; it is a full-sized <b>river</b>. The <i>water</i> to the left tells us what we are dealing with, and the <i>can</i> at the right tells us that our &quot;little engine that <i>could</i>&quot; has now become amphibious and is chugging down the Mighty Mississip' like a regular riverboat."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gsantise">gsantise</a>] 25-8-2007(175): A<strong> river</strong> CAN exist only if there is WATER.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Avispa">Avispa</a>] 29-8-2007(85): I kept confusing this with <em>stream</em>. My Japanese friend said that to him this is for an artificial<strong> river</strong>. Looking at kanji compounds with this there are two that struck me: One is the Yellow<strong> River</strong> in China ( 黄河 ), and the other is the Milky Way ( 銀河 ). Now I either think of the Little Engine that <em>could</em> dragging a bunch of stuff down a<strong> river</strong> in China and polluting it (so it turned yellow) or I see the Little Engine that Could flying across the sky making the Milky Way.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe">stereovibe</a>] 11-3-2008(44): With enough <em>water</em> you <em>can</em> make a<strong> river</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen">Ningen</a>] 26-8-2008(24): The lesson of persistence: even drops of <em>water can</em> become a<strong> RIVER</strong>.
