heisig: "The character in this frame represents a step up from the <i>stream</i> we met in Frame 134; it is a full-sized <b>river</b>. The <i>water</i> to the left tells us what we are dealing with, and the <i>can</i> at the right tells us that our &quot;little engine that <i>could</i>&quot; has now become amphibious and is chugging down the Mighty Mississip' like a regular riverboat."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gsantise">gsantise</a>] 25-8-2007(175): A<strong> river</strong> CAN exist only if there is WATER.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Avispa">Avispa</a>] 29-8-2007(85): I kept confusing this with <em>stream</em>. My Japanese friend said that to him this is for an artificial<strong> river</strong>. Looking at kanji compounds with this there are two that struck me: One is the Yellow<strong> River</strong> in China ( 黄河 ), and the other is the Milky Way ( 銀河 ). Now I either think of the Little Engine that <em>could</em> dragging a bunch of stuff down a<strong> river</strong> in China and polluting it (so it turned yellow) or I see the Little Engine that Could flying across the sky making the Milky Way.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aspr8045">aspr8045</a>] 2-2-2009(72): &quot;I CAN has WATER?&quot; sez<strong> river</strong>cat.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe">stereovibe</a>] 11-3-2008(44): With enough <em>water</em> you <em>can</em> make a<strong> river</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen">Ningen</a>] 26-8-2008(24): The lesson of persistence: even drops of <em>water can</em> become a<strong> RIVER</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 16-1-2008(19): A<strong> river</strong> <em>can</em> be used to transport goods, irrigate land--in short, a<strong> river</strong> is a body of <em>water</em> that <em>can</em> do so much more than a stream or a creek.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep">pazustep</a>] 1-7-2008(13): A<strong> river</strong> is the <em>water</em> that <em>can</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scotty28">scotty28</a>] 20-6-2009(12): You want to cross the<strong> river</strong> but there is so much WATER!, You cry out in frustation&quot;There&#039;s too much water in this<strong> river</strong>, I can&#039;t cross it. Can someone help me?&quot; suddenly out of the WATER appears OBAMA&#039;s head (primitive for CAN!), who of course encourages you with his &quot;yes you CAN!&quot; and in the end, yes you could cross the<strong> river</strong> with lots of water. Thanks Obama.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fabiomandrioli">fabiomandrioli</a>] 18-1-2009(9): <em>Water</em> that <em>can</em> make it all the way to the ocean is generally called a<strong> river</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63">ashman63</a>] 25-3-2008(6): Imagine opening a &quot;<em>can</em>&quot; and having a<strong> river</strong> of <em>water</em> suddenly gush out.
