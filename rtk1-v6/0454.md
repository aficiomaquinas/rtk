1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 5-4-2007(137): If it&#039;s <em>raining</em> and you&#039;re standing in the middle of a <em>rice field</em>, you&#039;re sure to soon become acquainted with the<strong> thunder</strong> up close and personal.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Keith">Keith</a>] 21-7-2006(67): <strong>Thunder</strong> is a sure sign of <em>rain</em> coming. When you hear the<strong> thunder</strong>, you&#039;ve got time to get out of the <em>field</em> before it starts <em>raining</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 28-3-2008(44): I&#039;ve been told by Japanese people that this word, 雷 （かみなり）　means BOTH<strong> thunder</strong> and lightning together. Though there is no individual word for<strong> thunder</strong>, there is for lightning (いなずま）, so I understand where Heisig is coming from. Just remember a powerful storm over an empty field and you&#039;re sure to remember this kanji.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Bullwhip">Bullwhip</a>] 3-5-2008(20): It&#039;s the<strong> Thunder</strong> with the <em>rain</em> that&#039;ll rattle your <em>brain</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/James87">James87</a>] 21-3-2011(9): In the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, once you obtain the third Spiritual Stone, you head to the castle to see the Princess. By the time you get there, RAIN is lashing down on Hyrule FIELD and<strong> thunder</strong> crashes overhead. And then you&#039;re nearly flattened by a horse, attacked by a madman and made to jump into a moat! Life&#039;s tough.
