heisig: "The final stroke of this kanji is a rare shape, which we have not met before and will only meet in this character and others that include it as a primitive. We are more accustomed to seeing it straightened out as part of other shapes - for instance, as the second stroke of <i>mouth</i>. If you need any help at all with this character, you may picture it as two hands of a clock pointing to what time it is <b>now</b>. The element above it, <i>meeting</i>, should easily relate to that image."
primit: "We shall use clock as the primitive meaning of this character, in line with the above explanation."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35">ruuku35</a>] 7-8-2007(230): My MEETING is at 7- but that&#039;s<strong> NOW</strong>!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 7-9-2007(32): (re: ruuku35) The <em>meeting</em> is not at <em>quarter to seven</em> but<strong> now</strong>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 24-1-2010(12): <em>Doc Brown</em> (primitive) from Back to the Future checks his watch. The meeting with Marty McFly and Biff is <strong>now</strong>. &quot;Great Scott.&quot; He&#039;s late, so he cuts a corner sharply in the DeLorean. It&#039;s such a sharp turn that it&#039;s found in no other kanji. Only Doc can pull it off.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wakela">Wakela</a>] 5-8-2007(10): Looks like a ラ　with a hat. Like a cowboy saying &quot;Raaat<strong> now</strong>, pardner.&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 28-12-2010(3): The <em>meeting</em> is<strong> now</strong>, <em>6:45</em>, according to the <em>hands of clock</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 26-5-2010(3): Primitive: <em>Clock/ Hiro</em> from heroes.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 10-6-2007(2): Primitive meaning = doc from back to the future (imagine him late for a meeting and he checks his clock &quot;Great scott!&quot; or him jumpling from the clock tower!).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KanjiHantaa">KanjiHantaa</a>] 3-4-2013(1): ¡<strong>Ahora</strong> es la <em>reunión</em>, según las manecillas de mi <em>reloj</em>!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dalmim">dalmim</a>] 15-9-2011(1): The <em>meeting</em> is<strong> NOW</strong>, if the <em>clock</em>&#039;s hands are right.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/somukeru">somukeru</a>] 10-8-2010(1): For me, this is a pictogram of Mount Doom, complete with path zig-zagging up to the entrance.
