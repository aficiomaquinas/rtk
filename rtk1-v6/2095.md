1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 7-5-2006(166): In the jungle there is a flowery<strong> vine</strong> called hedera rhombea that attracts humming birds by the dozens. They scoot around the flowers sucking up nectar off the<strong> vine</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-1-2006(104): Note : if you&#039;ll remember we already have a primitive for &quot;ivy&quot;, but it was completely made up from the &quot;square jewel&quot; kanji. The kanji here refers to ivy, or<strong> vine</strong>, and is used in a particular compound for &quot;Hedera rhombea&quot;, which is a type of ivy native to Japan. This<strong> vine</strong> here produces a lot of flowers, and attracts many small birds, which is sure to cheer up even the most depressed Japanese gardener.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christoph">Christoph</a>] 21-2-2007(35): It&#039;s strange that you don&#039;t often see <em>flowers</em> on <strong>vines</strong>, that&#039;s because those sneaky <em>birds</em> keep swooping in and stealing them!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Talka">Talka</a>] 17-9-2007(21): &quot;I heard it through the grapevine&quot; and &quot;a little birdy told me&quot; are actually the same metaphor, linked together by a proverbial flower that&#039;s since dropped from both expressions! Or so a bird on a flower grapevine told me...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 5-4-2009(8): The <em>flowery</em><strong> vine</strong> is the one that <em>birds</em> gather around.
