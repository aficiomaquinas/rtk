heisig: "We generally consider one <b>generation</b> as a period of thirty (or <i>ten</i> plus <i>ten</i> plus <i>ten</i>) years. If you look at this kanji in its completed form - not in its stroke order - you will see three <i>tens</i>. When writing it, think of the lower horizontal lines as &quot;addition&quot; lines written under numbers to add them up. Thus: <i>ten</i> &quot;plus&quot; <i>ten</i> &quot;plus&quot; <i>ten</i> = thirty. Actually, it's a lot easier doing it with a pencil than reading it in a book."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 21-7-2007(112): 3 tens =<strong> generation</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CarlKenner">CarlKenner</a>] 5-7-2007(71): They <strong>SAY</strong> a<strong> generation</strong> is <em>ten</em>+<em>ten</em>+<em>ten</em> years, with the big first <em>ten</em> providing a <em>grounding</em>, and the next <em>ten</em> providing a little more <em>grounding</em> for the final <em>ten</em>. But I wish the next<strong> generation</strong> didn&#039;t always <strong>SAY</strong> &quot;<strong>yo!</strong>&quot;. (ON reading is SEI, KUN reading is yo).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rakutenka">rakutenka</a>] 30-6-2007(41): The next<strong> generation</strong> is carried by the previous ones.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/csmdad">csmdad</a>] 9-6-2008(40): That swing has been in that tree for<strong> generation</strong>s.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KeroHazel">KeroHazel</a>] 21-8-2008(25): This looks like a picture of a test tube in a holder. Maybe it will be used to create test tube babies for a future<strong> generation</strong>.
