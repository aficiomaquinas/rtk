1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 14-3-2007(222): To get someone to <em>completely</em> <strong>acquiesce</strong> it takes <em>3</em> dunks in the <em>water</em> before they give.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 25-10-2007(87): To get someone to<strong> acquiesce</strong>, duck them <em>completely</em> in <em>aqua</em> (=<em>water</em>) <em>three</em> times. (variation on dingomick&#039;s).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 8-7-2008(42): Warning, Obscene!! I finally got my girl to<strong> acquiesce</strong> to a lewd act.. But it took <em>3 times</em> to get it in <em>completely</em> and lots of <em>water</em> to clean up afterwards.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 28-4-2008(17): You must ask the trapped <em>water sprite</em> not once, not twice, but <em>thrice</em> (a line from Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#039;s &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; comes to mind) before it will<strong> acquiesce</strong> to your requests. It&#039;s not for any mystical reasons, it&#039;s just that it hates being asked the same thing <em>three</em> times, like that character from Austin Powers.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 30-11-2009(16): Waterboarding: To <em>completely</em><strong> acquiesce</strong> it usually takes just <em>three</em> sessions with <em>water</em>. (Thanks to dingomick for the idea.).
