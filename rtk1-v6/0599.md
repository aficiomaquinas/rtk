1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 15-11-2006(208): When I put the <em>turkey</em> over the <em>oven fire</em>, it always ends up being <strong>charred</strong> beyond recognition. I&#039;m not a very good cook.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tcjeff">tcjeff</a>] 7-6-2008(67): <strong>Char</strong> could be any meat over <em>oven fire</em>. So why is it a <em>turkey</em> in this kanji? Because<strong> char</strong>red <em>turkey</em> is what sticks out most in your mind as the thing that ruined Thanksgiving dinner.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 22-12-2007(26): We see here the <em>roadrunner</em>, running so fast that it <strong>chars</strong> the ground beneath it, leaving a trace of <em>fire</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zardoz73">zardoz73</a>] 21-8-2008(19): Turkey is not very common in Japan. (found only in Subway sandwiches!) So when Japanese try to barbecue turkey on the grill, they always<strong> char</strong> the meat. <em>masaka!</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Apple_Head">Apple_Head</a>] 2-10-2009(10): Unfortunately, Ash Ketchum&#039;s<strong> char</strong>mander sucked so bad it devolved into a<strong> char</strong>turkey.<strong> Char</strong>mander has flames on its tail,<strong> char</strong>turkey has flames on its butt.
