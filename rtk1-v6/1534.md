heisig: "Though we shall later encounter the kanji for <i>bird</i>, we introduce this one for the tenth sign of the zodiac mainly because of its use as a primitive, where it has a different meaning."
primit: "As a primitive, it means whiskey bottle. In its pictograph, you can see the loosely corked lid, the bottle and the contents (about one-third full). You might also hink of the Spanish &quot;porron,&quot; a decanter shaped like a long-necked bird."
