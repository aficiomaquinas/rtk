1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 26-10-2007(325): <strong>Constancy</strong> is holding the same <em>state of mind</em> over a long <em>span</em> of time. (tweaking PepeSeco and mspertus).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 8-8-2007(70): <em>Data</em> is the epitome of <strong>constancy</strong>. As a robot, his consistency <em>spans</em> the entire day.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun">sutebun</a>] 25-10-2007(20): A term used by Kant. Kant says that humans are preconditioned to experience the world in space and time, but God&#039;s mind has<strong> Constancy</strong>. That is, God&#039;s is a state of mind that spans all time and is not inhibited by it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ivoSF">ivoSF</a>] 20-6-2006(16): Imagine a giant field of grass where a man sits trying to abtain zen, he sit still as a statue, holding his fingertips against eachother, while the day and night (the <em>span</em>ning of the day) shoot pass you like in a 100000x forwarded movie. the seasons change but yet the man does not move. that whole picture combined gives me a feel of<strong> constancy</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 6-2-2008(14): <em>Data</em> couldn&#039;t break the <em>span</em> of his<strong> CONSTANCY</strong> of his <em>state of mind</em> (ooh double reinforcement) if he tried. Just watch: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMWoaHyIKMs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMWoaHyIKMs</a> See? He is serious from dusk to dawn. He can&#039;t break that serious look for one moment.
