heisig: "<i>Head</i> . . . <i>crown</i> . . . <i>heart</i> . . . <i>walking legs</i>. Two things merit mention here. First, the doubling-up of the last stroke of <i>head</i> with the top of the <i>crown</i> serves to make the whole more aesthetically beautiful. It happens so rarely that the exceptions are easily learned. Second, try to make a single image out of the four elements. (Religious statuary of <b>melancholy</b> figures should offer plenty of suggestions.)"

What a wuss.
