heisig: "Remember when your granny used to ask you to bend your arms at the <i>elbows</i> and hold them out so that she could use them like a rack to hold a skein of string or yarn (here <b>thread</b>) while she rolled it up into a <i>little</i> ball? Now can you see the two <i>elbows</i> (with the second stroke doubling up) at the top, and the character for <i>little</i> below?"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lerris">lerris</a>] 3-7-2007(195): I also went with Spiderman. However, in the cases where this primitive appears under other primitives, as opposed to on the left (I think there are ~5 times in this chapter) I&#039;ve opted to use a similar character: Venom. This helps keep the positioning clear, especially on such characters as <a href="../v4/1363.html">dainty</a> (#1363 細) and <a href="../v4/1364.html">accumulate</a> (#1364 累).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Piitaa">Piitaa</a>] 17-7-2006(81): You&#039;ll be seeing this one a lot. Seriously.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 28-7-2007(56): On left with nothing on top of it --&gt; SPIDERMAN. everywhere else....SPIDERPIG.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 14-6-2007(20): I&#039;ll stick with Spiderman. He&#039;s a very memorable character, and don&#039;t forget that he can shoot strings from both arms. What happens to the relative primitive when Spiderman comes along? If you can clearly picture his<strong> thread</strong>s winding, pulling, yanking, sticking to, filling, tying, and strangling objects, then you&#039;ll never confuse this primitive with another one.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aphasiac">aphasiac</a>] 13-10-2009(16): Hate to be pedantic, but it&#039;s spelt <em>Spider-man</em>, not <em>Spiderman</em>. Stan Lee added the hyphen to differentiate him from <em>Superman</em>..
