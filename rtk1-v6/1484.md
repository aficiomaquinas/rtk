1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 27-2-2007(164): What could be more<strong> mysterious</strong> than a <em>cocoon</em> in a <em>top hat</em> trying to sneak in...? (Pimitive: <em>GANDALF</em>).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 31-5-2007(97): The invisible man in his <em>top hat</em> and <em>cocoon</em> of white bandages is the most<strong> mysterious</strong> man in the world.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 17-2-2008(83): As romanrozhok said, this kanji has little to do with <strong>mysterious</strong>. It has the meanings [dark, abstruse, calm] (in Spanish, [moreno and recóndito]). As for the story, the union of a <em>hat</em> and a <em>coccoon</em> is obviously a fakir <em>turban</em>. India was maybe an <strong>abstruse</strong> place far away from China. Visualize a <strong>mysterious</strong>, <strong>dark-skinned</strong> fakir with a <em>turban</em> (in <strong>calming</strong> meditation) and the kanji is yours!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 24-2-2008(30): This kanji does not really mean &quot;mysterious.&quot; In fact, out of all the words this kanji in used in, only one, an uncommon word, has that meaning faintly. If you look the kanji up, you will see that it is used in: 玄関 【げんかん】 (n) entranceway; entry hall; (P)--and-- 玄米 【げんまい】 (n) unpolished rice; unmilled rice; brown rice; (P) (as well as other &quot;unpolished grains.&quot; (EDIT: I removed my story and am using DrJones&#039;s story).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 25-1-2008(10): Even more<strong> mysterious</strong> than this huge alien <em>cocoon</em> is the fact that it is wearing a <em>top hat</em>.
