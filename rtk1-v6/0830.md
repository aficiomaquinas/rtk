1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the40pancakes">the40pancakes</a>] 14-4-2009(108): YOU CAN&#039;T POSSIBLY NEED A MNEMONIC FOR THIS!!!!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(67): Pictograph, see book. * As a primitive this element appears equally as well at the top or bottom of the kanjis (besides appearing to the left). Since a<strong> mountain</strong> often brings to mind towering peaks, I will consider it implied that the element is placed at the top of the kanji. When this primitive appears at the bottom, I will arrange my story in a way that other elements are said to be at the very top of the<strong> mountain</strong> (see FRAME 775 for an example).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 14-5-2009(9): Stroke order: Begin with the center vertical.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 9-10-2008(7): I wouldn&#039;t have thrown my <em>walking stick</em> in the <em>trash bin</em> if I&#039;d known I&#039;d be climbing a<strong> mountain</strong>!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bandwidthjunkie">bandwidthjunkie</a>] 22-12-2008(5): One thing I have found useful is to name the<strong> mountain</strong>s in different positions after different<strong> mountain</strong>s: The one at the top is mount Everest, the one at the left is mount Kilimanjaro, and the one at the bottom is Ben Nevis (the highest<strong> mountain</strong> in Britain, but still a dwarf compared to most<strong> mountain</strong>s), and the one that appears in the middle with a line through it is Mt. Fuji (why not?).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sam312">Sam312</a>] 6-4-2011(2): Mr.<strong> Mountain</strong>, <em>yama</em>-<em>SAN</em>. (ON: SAN, SEN; KUN: yama).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inaka_rob">inaka_rob</a>] 25-1-2010(2): This should be #11 in Hesigs book. Probably easier to remember than 日 .

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KanjiHantaa">KanjiHantaa</a>] 5-6-2013(1): Una <strong>montaña</strong> se puede representar con tres <em>bastones</em> saliendo del <em>suelo</em>.
