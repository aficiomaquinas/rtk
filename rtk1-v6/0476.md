heisig: "This character, a pictograph of a <b>spoon</b>, is easy enough to remember, provided you keep it distinct from that for <i>seven</i>, where the first stroke is written left to right (the opposite of here) and cuts noticeably across the second."
commen: "* As a primitive, this kanji can take on the additional meaning of someone <i>sitting on the ground</i>, of which it can also be considered a pictograph. In general, the second stroke does not cut through the first - or if it does in some fonts, only slightly."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 3-9-2007(146): To remember the primitive meaning, picture someone sitting on the ground performing Seppuku...with a<strong> spoon</strong>. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/co48k">http://tinyurl.com/co48k</a>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 16-1-2008(52): Not only is stroke order important, but also be sure to note the <em>direction</em> of a stroke. In both &#039;spoon&#039; and &#039;seven&#039;, the first stroke is the horizontal one - but here it is written right to left in a downward flick, while in &#039;seven&#039; it is a strong line from left to right.
