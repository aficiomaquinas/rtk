heisig: "This character, a pictograph of a <b>spoon</b>, is easy enough to remember, provided you keep it distinct from that for <i>seven</i>, where the first stroke is written left to right (the opposite of here) and cuts noticeably across the second."
primit: "As a primitive, this kanji can take on the additional meaning of someone sitting on the ground, of which it can also be considered a pictograph. In this case, the second stroke does not cut through the first at all, as in the following FRAME."

In both &#039;spoon&#039; and &#039;seven&#039;, the first stroke is the horizontal one - but here it is written right to left in a downward flick, while in &#039;seven&#039; it is a strong line from left to right.
