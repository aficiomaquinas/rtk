heisig: "Three elements are given here: <i>flower</i> . . . <i>generation</i> . . . <i>tree</i>. The first and last seem logical enough, since it is the <b>leaf</b> that feeds the <i>flowers</i> on a <i>tree</i>. The element for <i>generation</i> interposed between the two suggests that the movement of a <i>tree</i> from one <i>generation</i> to the next is like its &quot;turning over a new <b>leaf</b>.&quot;"
