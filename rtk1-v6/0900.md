1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 20-1-2006(234): You&#039;ve probably guessed it by now, this is the <em>road</em> that Sam and Frodo take to<strong> send back</strong> the <em>ring</em> to Mount Doom! (see previous frame, the <em>jewel</em> is replaced by the <em>road</em>).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 15-12-2007(110): Continued from <a href="../v4/836.html">ring</a> (#836 環)....... So I&#039;m on the <em>road</em> going to <strong>send back</strong> the <em>ring</em> minus the <em>jewel</em>, the hit to the floor knocked it out.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thora">Thora</a>] 3-2-2008(36): A <a href="../v4/836.html">ring</a> (#836 環) with no <em>jewel</em>?! she screamed and told her fiance to hit the <em>road</em> - she&#039;d<strong> send back</strong> the ring.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saranich">saranich</a>] 19-11-2006(30): The Saudi woman was tired of looking at the floor and covering her mouth with a scarf, so she asked her husband to send her back on the road to home, though she didn&#039;t<strong> send back</strong> the ring.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63">ashman63</a>] 4-5-2008(6): This shows the <em>road</em> travelled by Frodo in the Lord of the Rings to<strong> send back</strong> the <em>One</em> ring to the <em>mouth</em> of Mordor...wrapped delicately in a <em>silk scarf</em>, of course. All the while, the <em>eye</em> of Sauron looks on.
