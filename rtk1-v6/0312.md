heisig: "If you can imagine <i>trees</i> as <b>status</b> symbols (as they might well be for those living in Japan's congested cities, where greenery has become something of a luxury item), then <i>each</i> might be aiming to have his/her own <i>tree</i>, just to keep up with the Suzukis."

Unless you are Kumi KOUda and can actually afford to buy lots of trees, the only way you will get them is if you KAKU them.
