2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Weber">Weber</a>] 28-2-2007(98): Courts in olden times would often punish convicts by sentencing them to a life of being the rower crew for large<strong> rowboat</strong> ships (there were no engines or boilers back then)... Yo ho, Yo ho....

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 11-10-2007(35): &quot;Row, row, row your <em>boat</em>.....&quot;. Imagine someone who goes to <em>court</em>, claiming they wrote this song first.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/foodcubes">foodcubes</a>] 7-11-2010(14): Sometimes abstract imagery works very well. Imagine someone showing up to <strong>court</strong> in a <strong>rowboat</strong>. Really imagine them rowing it across the floor and you won&#039;t forget this Kanji.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 9-10-2005(13): There&#039;s a phrase in English to &quot;send you up the river,&quot; meaning to be sent to jail. If you think of this then all you have to do is picture the courts sending you up the river in a boat... a<strong> rowboat</strong> to be precise. If it helps, you can also think of your state then as being &quot;up the creek without a paddle.&quot;.

They setup a <em>court</em> to decide the matter. The presiding judge announced the following: &quot;Women and children first. Then first class passengers.&quot; I guess Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) won&#039;t be making it off the Titanic after all.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 27-2-2007(6): To be &quot;sent up the river&quot; means to be sent to jail. This <em>boat</em> being used by the <em>court</em> to send you up the river is a <strong>rowboat</strong>. Maybe a slave galley?

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thomasritz">thomasritz</a>] 5-7-2009(5): Oliver <strong>Kahn</strong> rudert mit seinem <em>Boot</em> zum <em>Gerichtshof</em>.
