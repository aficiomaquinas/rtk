1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 23-12-2006(200): In venice, the <em>boat</em> used by the <em>courts</em> to transport criminals is a<strong> rowboat</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Weber">Weber</a>] 28-2-2007(98): Courts in olden times would often punish convicts by sentencing them to a life of being the rower crew for large<strong> rowboat</strong> ships (there were no engines or boilers back then)... Yo ho, Yo ho....

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 11-10-2007(35): &quot;Row, row, row your <em>boat</em>.....&quot;. Imagine someone who goes to <em>court</em>, claiming they wrote this song first.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/foodcubes">foodcubes</a>] 7-11-2010(14): Sometimes abstract imagery works very well. Imagine someone showing up to <strong>court</strong> in a <strong>rowboat</strong>. Really imagine them rowing it across the floor and you won&#039;t forget this Kanji.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 9-10-2005(13): There&#039;s a phrase in English to &quot;send you up the river,&quot; meaning to be sent to jail. If you think of this then all you have to do is picture the courts sending you up the river in a boat... a<strong> rowboat</strong> to be precise. If it helps, you can also think of your state then as being &quot;up the creek without a paddle.&quot;.
