1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog">guidedog</a>] 19-7-2007(139): <strong>Sugar</strong> made from rice has a tangy flavour.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 18-11-2007(125): The <em>T&#039;ang</em> are the ones who began using<strong> sugar</strong> in China--of course, the first thing they tried it on was <em>rice</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 4-1-2010(56): The ultimate<strong> sugar</strong>y breakfast is a <em>rice krispy treat</em> and a big glass of <em>Tang</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hinode">Hinode</a>] 11-3-2009(37): This is what my research yielded on the origin of the kanji: The traditional form of<strong> sugar</strong> in China was maltose, which is a form a<strong> sugar</strong> made from malt (= dried <em>grains</em>). It was still used in the late Han and throughout the Tang period, though during the Tang<strong> sugar</strong> cane substituted <em>grains</em> as the primary source of<strong> sugar</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 11-9-2007(24): <em>Condi Rice</em> wakes up every morning and spoons about three cups of<strong> sugar</strong> into her <em>Tang</em>. Why? Well, she&#039;s got to have something to hype her up about facing the American public day after day. Picture her waking up and shaking until she gets her daily<strong> sugar</strong> ration...then things go overboard and she starts to pipe<strong> sugar</strong>-loaded <em>Tang</em> straight into her veins..
