heisig: "Think of the key word <b>seal</b> as referring to a letter you have written and are preparing to close. Instead of using the traditional wax <b>seal</b>, you <i>glue</i> a sprig of <i>ivy</i> on the outside. In this way the elements <i>ivy</i> and <i>glue</i> give you a curious and memorable way to <b>seal</b> your secret letters."
