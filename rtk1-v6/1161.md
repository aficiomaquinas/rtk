1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 7-2-2006(331): This<strong> hearth</strong> is equipped with a <em>fire</em>-proof <em>door</em>. On the kanji you can see somewhat pictographically the <em>fire</em>-proof <em>door</em> keeping the <em>fire</em> behind, and nothing comes under the <em>door</em> primitive, where you would have expected to see another primitive.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zareon">Zareon</a>] 28-2-2007(48): -&quot;Honey? Do we have any wood left for the<strong> hearth</strong>?&quot; -&quot;Aagh, just use the frickin&#039; door!&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Verdana">Verdana</a>] 8-7-2009(30): <strong>Hearth</strong> is a fireplace, meaning a <em>fire-door</em> in the wall.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 15-2-2008(20): This<strong> hearth</strong> is Calcifer, from Howl&#039;s Moving Castle. He&#039;s a pain, so you <em>bolt the door</em> when you leave, so that he can&#039;t follow you out.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 7-7-2009(10): This is a reminder that when the <em>fire</em> is going in the<strong> hearth</strong>, keep the <em>door</em> closed so we&#039;re not heating up the whole outdoors.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavisMcDavis">DavisMcDavis</a>] 27-7-2009(9): A<strong> hearth</strong> is a door that is on fire. If you have read Harry Potter, you will recall that they frequently use a flaming<strong> hearth</strong> (along with Floo powder) as a door to teleport to other places.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun">sutebun</a>] 13-11-2007(8): (For WoW players): Paladins being able to just shield and<strong> hearth</strong> opened the door to a lot of flames.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shank">shank</a>] 19-11-2009(6): Santa Clause uses the<strong> hearth</strong> as his <em>door</em> so make sure you put the <em>fire</em> out!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 13-2-2007(3): Note that the <em>fire</em> is next to the <em>door</em>. This means the <em>door</em> is the opening from the fireplace into the<strong> hearth</strong> area in the room (which is often a glass <em>door</em>) and not the flue. (To remember the 戸 is on the right, just visualize it as opening away from the 火 ).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 10-3-2006(3): Shut the door to make sure the fire doesn&#039;t escape the<strong> hearth</strong>.
