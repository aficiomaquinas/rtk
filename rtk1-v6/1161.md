1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 7-2-2006(331): This<strong> hearth</strong> is equipped with a <em>fire</em>-proof <em>door</em>. On the kanji you can see somewhat pictographically the <em>fire</em>-proof <em>door</em> keeping the <em>fire</em> behind, and nothing comes under the <em>door</em> primitive, where you would have expected to see another primitive.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zareon">Zareon</a>] 28-2-2007(48): -&quot;Honey? Do we have any wood left for the<strong> hearth</strong>?&quot; -&quot;Aagh, just use the frickin&#039; door!&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Verdana">Verdana</a>] 8-7-2009(30): <strong>Hearth</strong> is a fireplace, meaning a <em>fire-door</em> in the wall.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 15-2-2008(20): This<strong> hearth</strong> is Calcifer, from Howl&#039;s Moving Castle. He&#039;s a pain, so you <em>bolt the door</em> when you leave, so that he can&#039;t follow you out.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 7-7-2009(10): This is a reminder that when the <em>fire</em> is going in the<strong> hearth</strong>, keep the <em>door</em> closed so we&#039;re not heating up the whole outdoors.
