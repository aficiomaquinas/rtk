heisig: "Connoting the measurement of the depth of <i>water</i>, the keyword <b>fathom</b> begins with the <i>water</i> primitive. To its right, we see the compound-primitive for <i>rule</i> (Frame 92) which we learned in the sense of a &quot;ruler&quot; or &quot;measure.&quot; Hence, when we <i>rule</i> <i>water</i> we <b>fathom</b> it. What could be simpler? But be careful; its simplicity is deceptive. Be sure to picture yourself <b>fathoming</b> a body of <i>water</i> several hundred feet deep by using a <i>ruler</i> of gargantuan proportions."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 11-1-2007(150): A <em>fathom</em> is the unit you use when making <strong>rules</strong> about <strong>water</strong>&#039;s depth.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/XanthosDeia">XanthosDeia</a>] 13-7-2008(76): You can&#039;t<strong> fathom</strong> how deep this <em>water</em> is. Perhaps you should use a <em>ruler</em> to measure it?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cornfed">cornfed</a>] 20-1-2008(28): Imagine jumping in the water and riding a shellfish down to the bottom, measuring<strong> fathom</strong>s with your ruler.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anroo">anroo</a>] 15-7-2009(20): <strong>Fathom</strong>s beneath the <em>water</em>, a <em>shellfish</em> defends the depths with his <em>sabre</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 17-10-2009(17): HINT: I find 測 and 則 confusing. For 則 <a href="../v4/88">rule</a> (#88 則)Heisig describes the keyword as a rule (regulation). Then in <a href="../v4/149">fathom</a> (#149 測) he suggests 則 is a ruler or measure! Whatever stories you choose, don&#039;t loose sight of the meaning: 則 = rule (regulation, law), 測 =<strong> fathom</strong> (measure, conjecture).
