1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 27-6-2006(242): A friend of mine made up a rhyme for this one: &quot;house with a spine,<strong> Shinto shrine</strong>&quot;!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-1-2006(163): This<strong> Shinto shrine</strong> is built with human <em>spines</em>. Have you ever seen the ossuary in Sedlec, near Kutna Hora in Czech Republic ? It is a small church entirely decorated with human bones. Do a web search for &quot;sedlec ossuary&quot;, it&#039;s quite a sight.

Is very important for them; The<strong> Shinto shrine</strong> is really the <em>spine of the house</em>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamidana">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamidana</a>.
