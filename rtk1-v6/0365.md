heisig: "The personalism connoted by the word <b>instruction</b>, as opposed to &quot;teaching&quot; or &quot;discipline,&quot; suits the picture here of <i>words</i> guiding one's progress like the gentle flowing of a <i>stream</i>. Even the etymology of the word <b>instruction</b> suggests the sense of &quot;pouring into&quot;."
