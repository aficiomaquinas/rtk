heisig: "The only thing that distinguishes this character from that for <i>bird</i> is the omission of the one stroke that makes it <i>white</i>. Which is logical enough, when you consider that there are no <b>crows</b> of that color."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 5-1-2007(184): The book&#039;s story is just fine, but I found a kanji dictionary explanation also interesting: As<strong> crow</strong>s are all black, it&#039;s hard to see where their eyes are (black on black), so a stroke is removed from the part in the pictograph where the eyes would be.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/squeaky_lill_mk">squeaky_lill_mk</a>] 30-6-2009(59): A<strong> crow</strong> is a <em>bird</em>, but <em>not a white one</em>. MEANING: write <em>bird</em>, but skip writing <em>one</em> in <em>white</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dusmar84">dusmar84</a>] 11-2-2010(23): When God made<strong> crow</strong>s he took away their <em>whiteness</em> and gave them big <em>mouths</em> instead.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 21-11-2008(6): The <strong>crow</strong> is a bird with a big mouth (caw! caw!) and no white feathers to be seen.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nick65765">Nick65765</a>] 16-6-2012(4): <strong>Crow</strong>s are not white birds. brilliant.
