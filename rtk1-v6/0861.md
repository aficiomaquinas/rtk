5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 4-9-2007(16): Our town&#039;s public<strong> hall</strong> is really just a large <em>port-a-potty</em> sitting on a big mound of dirt. Imagine going to an election and having to trudge up a mound of dirt, then sit in a cramped, smelly <em>port-a-potty</em> along with several other citizens just to hear this week&#039;s minutes.
