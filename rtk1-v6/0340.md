1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jschekkerman">jschekkerman</a>] 5-5-2007(183): Imagine a road built so well that it takes only a<strong> week</strong> to travel the circumference of the earth.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/axelb">axelb</a>] 11-4-2009(100): Actually the<strong> week</strong> is like a never ending <em>road</em> where we travel in a circle through the same seven days again and again, the <em>circumference</em> is always the same. <a href="../v4/317">circumference</a> (#317 周) also means circuit or lap, so that also makes think about the rotations of the moon, sun and the earth -- all important for measuring all kinds of time periods.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stshores24">stshores24</a>] 1-6-2008(21): This city is so big, it takes a<strong> week</strong> to travel around its <em>circumference</em> by <em>road</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/activeaero">activeaero</a>] 18-8-2008(13): It takes a<strong> WEEK</strong> to walk the &quot;circumference&quot; of this &quot;road&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johngwk">johngwk</a>] 9-2-2011(6): The <em>circumference</em> of Japan would take at least a<strong> week</strong> on the <em>road</em> to navigate.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/WithLoveFromExIA">WithLoveFromExIA</a>] 9-8-2010(3): Many people have their lives set to a<strong> week</strong>ly rota, you could say the<strong> week</strong> is their <em>circumference</em> of living, the endless repeating <em>road</em> they follow until they can afford to retire.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bigs201">bigs201</a>] 16-3-2009(3): Imagine a road in a board game with one square for each day of the<strong> week</strong>. One <em>lap</em> on this <em>road</em> and one<strong> week</strong> passes.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun">sutebun</a>] 12-9-2007(3): The hardest marathon (Self-Transcedence 3100 mile race) takes at least 6<strong> week</strong>s. Currently the fastest time is 6<strong> week</strong>s. The depressing thing, however, is not the time, but that runners run only the circumference of a road block for those many<strong> week</strong>s.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alphador">alphador</a>] 30-1-2010(2): Prendendo quella STRADA puoi fare il giro del mondo (cioè percorrere tutta la CIRCONFERENZA della terra) in una SETTIMANA.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tornadic_Indignation">Tornadic_Indignation</a>] 26-4-2009(2): It took me a <strong>week</strong> to travel the <em>circumference</em> of the <em>path</em> used for running at our school because I have no legs and I’m mentally retarded.
