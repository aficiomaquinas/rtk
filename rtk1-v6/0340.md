1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jschekkerman">jschekkerman</a>] 5-5-2007(183): Imagine a road built so well that it takes only a<strong> week</strong> to travel the circumference of the earth.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/axelb">axelb</a>] 11-4-2009(100): Actually the<strong> week</strong> is like a never ending <em>road</em> where we travel in a circle through the same seven days again and again, the <em>circumference</em> is always the same. <a href="../v4/317">circumference</a> (#317 周) also means circuit or lap, so that also makes think about the rotations of the moon, sun and the earth -- all important for measuring all kinds of time periods.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stshores24">stshores24</a>] 1-6-2008(21): This city is so big, it takes a<strong> week</strong> to travel around its <em>circumference</em> by <em>road</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/activeaero">activeaero</a>] 18-8-2008(13): It takes a<strong> WEEK</strong> to walk the &quot;circumference&quot; of this &quot;road&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johngwk">johngwk</a>] 9-2-2011(6): The <em>circumference</em> of Japan would take at least a<strong> week</strong> on the <em>road</em> to navigate.
