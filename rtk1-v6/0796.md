1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball">Thunderball</a>] 5-8-2007(263): If you really<strong> love</strong> someone, you won&#039;t keep them in a cage-like <em>bird house</em> relationship, but rather open the door and let their <em>heart</em> <em>walk</em> around freely. Think less about &quot;I&quot; (あい) and more about &quot;we&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/szreter">szreter</a>] 17-3-2008(156): The man is about to enter the &#039;<em>birdhouse</em>&#039; (brothel) when he remembers his true <em>love</em> at home, and, following his <em>heart</em>, uses his <em>walking legs</em> to go straight home.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 17-10-2007(58): <a href="midori://search?text=愛は相手の心を受けることです。">愛は相手の心を受けることです。</a> (I heard that one from a buddhist priest - dont forget the extra stroke).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 28-4-2006(21): Here we see what the guy from <a href="../v4/616.html">melancholy</a> (#616 憂) ended up doing. To solve his matters of heart, he turned his walking legs towards the brothel (bird house) seeking for<strong> love</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(19): An overly romantic man carries a bird house all the time with him, so he can send<strong> love</strong>-messages with his pigeons wherever he goes on his walking legs. His heart beating heavily in between the bird house (sitting atop the head like a hat), and the walking legs.
