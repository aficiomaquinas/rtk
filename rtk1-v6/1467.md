1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 26-10-2007(157): <em>Spiderman</em>&#039;s polyethylene suit starts to ride up after a while, so he always looks forward to the <em>white</em><strong> cotton</strong> <em>towels</em> he wears while lounging around his apartment.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 19-12-2007(95): <strong>Cotton</strong> is the preferred <em>thread</em> for making <em>white</em> <em>towels</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/desmidus">desmidus</a>] 2-4-2008(67): Spiderman has a dark secret - he has stolen all the white<strong> cotton</strong> towels from every hotel he has ever been in.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 26-5-2006(22): Thread customarily used to make white towels with.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 14-1-2008(18): Compare with <a href="../v4/411">brocade</a> (#411 錦). If the <em>white</em> <em>towel</em> is made of plain <em>threads</em> with no golden decoration, then it&#039;s just a plain towel. But at least it&#039;s a good fluffy<strong> cotton</strong> towel, not one of those cheap synthetic fibers. Remember: if it can&#039;t be golden (as in <a href="../v4/411">brocade</a> (#411 錦)), at least make it<strong> cotton</strong>.
