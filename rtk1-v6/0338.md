1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ibardell">ibardell</a>] 27-7-2007(260): The<strong> cottage</strong> is so small - it has an umbrella for the roof; soil for the floor and room for only one mouth.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 13-11-2006(57): Picture a <em>lidded crock</em> full of tasty<strong> cottage</strong> cheese... yum! Now all we need is an <em>umbrella</em> over it to protect the<strong> cottage</strong> cheese from the sun.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball">Thunderball</a>] 15-9-2007(25): The homeless man stuck an <em>umbrella</em> over his <em>lidded crock</em> in the country side and declared it his<strong> cottage</strong>. It looks just like a shack (しゃ) though! Under local government legislation, after 7 years, the &quot;cottage&quot; and land were his.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 18-6-2009(18): I call it my<strong> cottage</strong>, but it&#039;s really just an <em>umbrella</em> over a <em>dirty hole</em> in the ground.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elitentity">elitentity</a>] 31-1-2006(14): To further Heisig&#039;s explanation, imagine a<strong> cottage</strong> made out of a giant lidded crock and an umbrella. The mouth can also represent a door.
