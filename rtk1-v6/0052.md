heisig: "The word <b>eminent</b> suggests a famous or well-known person. So all you need to do - given the primitives of a <i>magic wand</i> and a <i>sunflower</i>&nbsp;- is to think of the world's most <b>eminent</b> magician as one who uses a <i>sunflower</i> for a <i>magic wand</i> (like a flower-child who goes around turning the world into peace and love)."
