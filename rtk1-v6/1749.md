1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 7-7-2007(230): The <strong>simplicity</strong> of <em>bamboo</em> plant is in all its joints being at equal <em>intervals</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 28-5-2007(97): [simplicity; brevity] The ししおどし is a <em>bamboo</em> device for scaring birds from the gates of your garden by clacking against a stone at regular <em>interval</em>s. Its design is <strong>simplicity</strong> itself. (Inspired by PepeSeco).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 25-2-2008(38): Wordplay:<strong> simplicity</strong> -&gt; simcity. You are playing a game of SimCity, a city simulator. You can choose from one of several pre-defined city layouts. One of the city layouts is called &quot;<strong>SimpliCity</strong> (a simple city for SimCity)&quot;. This layout has nothing but an empty field with <em>bamboo</em> trees planted at regular <em>intervals</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 9-7-2006(37): In an existence of utmost<strong> simplicity</strong> you spend time listening to the liquid-filled <em>bamboo</em> tube (ししおどし) clacking at regular <em>interval</em>s.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 24-3-2009(22): I imagine one of those little <strong>bamboo</strong> fountains where the bamboo fills with water, tips over and lets out the water, and then tips back to get filled again. In this way, it marks out even <strong>intervals</strong>. THAT is<strong> simplicity</strong>.
