heisig: "The key word here refers of course to the <b>T'ang</b> Dynasty in China (and not to the name of the drink astronauts take with them into outer space, though this could be useful for the next frame). Its elements: <i>cave</i> . . . <i>rake</i> . . . <i>mouth</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 2-4-2007(244): Two archeologists are in a <em>cave</em> looking at Chinese artifacts from various eras. One picks up a <em>rake</em> and says, &quot;What about this – T&#039;ang, do you think?&quot; The second puts the <em>rake</em> in his <em>mouth</em> and answers, &quot;Yes, it does <strong>tang</strong> a bit&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 17-12-2005(133): Screw it, this character refers to the drink. The powdery orange substance is actually found on the floor of tropical <em>caves</em>, where trained aboriginal peoples use wooden <em>rakes</em> to rake the Tang into a pile before putting a bit of it in their <em>mouths</em> to see if it&#039;s tasty or not.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Transtic">Transtic</a>] 21-3-2008(94): (Based on matticus) The <strong>Tang</strong> juice was created in China in the <strong>T&#039;ANG</strong> dinasty. The T&#039;ANG emperor discovered that certain <strong>cave</strong>s walls had a very sweet smell, so he <strong>raked</strong> the walls of one of them and put the <strong>rake</strong> into his <strong>mouth</strong>. This way he discovered that tasty powder that nowadays is known as TANG juice.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zanzibar">zanzibar</a>] 31-5-2009(44): Archaeologists found an ancient RAKE from the T&#039;ang dynasty at the MOUTH of the CAVE.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 19-1-2008(14): I imagine that people from the T&#039;ang dinasty looked a bit like cartoony asians, with teeth so prominent that looked like <em>rakes</em> on their <em>mouth</em>. They felt ridiculous about that, so they usually hid on <em>caves</em>, wishing for a dinasty with better depictions.
