1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor">fiminor</a>] 20-3-2007(182): The thing about feathers is that they usually cover the entire bird. A creature with <em>feathers</em> only on its <strong>wings</strong> would be very <em>uncommon</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 7-12-2007(56): <strong>WING</strong>S without any FEATHERS would be an UNCOMMON site. Well, unless you like to eat chicken<strong> WING</strong>S alot.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 9-7-2009(41): This is つばさ. To make a distinct image you can think about aircraft<strong> wing</strong> for which this kanji is also used. <em>Feathers</em> would be extremely <em>uncommon</em> to use in design of an aircraft<strong> wing</strong>s.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 16-6-2008(24): When we talk about<strong> wing</strong>s and <strong>feathers</strong> we usually talk about 羽 , but the more <strong>uncommon</strong> form is つばさ for larger<strong> wing</strong>s- like angels - quite <strong>uncommon</strong> beings.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rich_f">rich_f</a>] 10-3-2008(21): Reki&#039;s <strong>wing</strong> <em>feathers</em> were an <em>uncommon</em> color among haibane--they were black instead of white.
