1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PacifistGod">PacifistGod</a>] 22-7-2007(169): In case of emergency, The Pinnacle has<strong> auxiliary</strong> guard dogs, but they keep them muzzeled until they&#039;re needed.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 18-1-2008(102): When you climb the <em>pinnacle</em> you&#039;ll need to take a <em>muzzle</em> of<strong> auxiliary</strong> oxygen.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kieron">Kieron</a>] 31-3-2008(70): Make sure you&#039;ve got the primitives and ordering down, so as to avoid confusion with 部 <a href="../v4/1845.html">section</a> (#1845 部) later on.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/unauthorized">unauthorized</a>] 5-12-2009(48): Hint: This is a very rarely used kanji and the only relatively common word that contain it is 陪審 「ばいしん」 (meaning jury, juryman). I recommend using one of these meanings as a keyword, since you are not going to see it anywhere else unless you intend to read historic novels. [Trivia: The other meaning of this kanji is something in the spirit of subordinate. Look it up on wwwjdic if you are curious.].

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 12-1-2008(28): When I see<strong> auxiliary</strong> I think of the &quot;AUX&quot; input on an amplifier. Imagine a PA system being used at a protest event outside the gates of <em>The Pinnacle</em>. The protester shouts into his PA system to get the attention of the decadent residents of The Pinnacle. The guardsman of The Pinnacle silences (<em>muzzle</em>s) the protester by unplugging his microphone from the<strong> auxiliary</strong> jack of his amplifier. (Similar scene in Forrest Gump).
