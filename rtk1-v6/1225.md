1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BigAmish">BigAmish</a>] 15-8-2008(183): <strong>SNOW</strong> isn&#039;t all that different from <em>RAIN</em>, except it can be removed with a <em>BROOM</em> because it only forms in freezing temperatures.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 28-6-2010(53): Unlike <em>rain</em>,<strong> snow</strong> can be swept away with a <em>broom</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gibler">gibler</a>] 7-10-2011(8): PRIMITIVE: I like to relate the particle for BROOM also as HARRY POTTER on his BROOM. (stories become really easy for the next 11 kanji especially)... . STORY: During the summer Harry Potter on his broom shows off by turning the rain to<strong> snow</strong>. RTK2:　セツ 積雪 せきせつ(pilled up<strong> snow</strong>). <a href="midori://search?text=＃＊雪崩">＃＊雪崩</a> なだれ　Avalanche.
