heisig: "<i>Pent in</i> . . . <i>Big Dipper</i>. Hint: among the songs dating from the days of slavery that have become part of American folklore is one called &quot;Follow the Drinking Gourd.&quot; It referred to the nighttime travel of runaway slaves (those <i>pent in</i>) who had no <b>maps</b> other than the stars to guide them, among them the bright and predominant <i>Big Dipper</i>, the &quot;Drinking Gourd.&quot;"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 16-4-2007(217): Can&#039;t see direct relation to <a href="../v4/1177.html">Big Dipper</a> (#1177 斗) since its writing order is completely different. As raulir noted, it&#039;s written as overlapping at the last stroke of ツ and the first of メ. I take it as a pictograph or treasure<strong> map</strong>. Two dots represent big trees and the cross (marking the treasure) is placed relative to them.

Two steps east then X marks the spot. 図る はかる attempt, deceive; 地図 ちず<strong> map</strong>; 意図する いとする make a goal, intend to do; 図々しい ずうずうしい impudent, shameless; 図書館 としょかん library.
