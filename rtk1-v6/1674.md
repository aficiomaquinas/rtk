1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 17-1-2007(255): The <strong>constitution</strong> is important. At least my parents thought so. In the <em>house</em> where I <em>grew up</em>, it was framed on the wall. Under the watchful (sideways) <em>eye</em> of my mother, we had to study it until we knew it by <em>heart</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 4-3-2007(77): The <em>house</em> of US Congress needs to <em>grow up</em>! Their <em>twisted</em> eyes have lost the <em>heart</em> of the <strong>constitution</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 17-5-2007(49): The original Japanese<strong> constitution</strong> is locked up deep within the Imperial Palace, <em>home</em> of the Emperor. Since its creation, it&#039;s gotten <em>bigger and bigger</em>, and it&#039;s even grown a <em>pair of eyes</em>, as well as a <em>beating heart</em>. Naturally the Emperor tries to keep this hidden from the public, but what will they do once the<strong> constitution</strong>-monster becomes big enough to destroy the palace?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Odieone">Odieone</a>] 5-1-2009(34): I <em>grow up</em> in a <em>house</em> which values the<strong> constitution</strong>. My father always told me to look not just with my <em>eyes</em> but with my <em>heart</em> as well.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bennyb">bennyb</a>] 15-6-2009(23): [ +CharleyGarret + Growing up=Peter Pan] In Peter Pan&#039;s Lost Boys house, they eye the consitution every day and have learned it by heart. &quot;No Lost Girls, Captain Hook stinks, we&#039;ll never grow up! We&#039;ll scream till we&#039;re pink!&quot; (Hey, I&#039;m trying here - there are no other Peter Pan stories.).
