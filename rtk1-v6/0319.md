1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 28-1-2008(586): They all say they have a <em>TREE</em> between their <em>WALKING LEGS</em> but most only have a <strong>TWIG</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 8-11-2007(103): Don&#039;t confuse with branch or bough - think of snapping<strong> twig</strong>s. A<strong> twig</strong> is always the kind of <em>wood</em> that snaps when the hunter&#039;s <em>walking legs</em> just barely touch it, making a snapping sound that alerts the prey to the hunter&#039;s presence.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 11-6-2008(50): I don&#039;t believe this means<strong> twig</strong> as in a tree<strong> twig</strong>. 条 【じょう】 (n) (1) article (in document); provision; (2) stripe; streak; line. STORY: If TREES had WALKING LEGS they would march right up to congress and demand they put in a new ARTICLE into the constitution against deforestation.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 13-11-2009(24): (Doesn&#039;t mean<strong> twig</strong>!) I read an <strong>article</strong> in the Weekly World News about a <em>walking</em> <em>tree</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 8-5-2007(14): I once read an <strong>ARTICLE</strong> about a guy who shoved a <strong>TREE</strong> between his <em>WALKING LEGS</em>. he was pulling out<strong> TWIG</strong>s for a long time.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei">javiergakusei</a>] 28-3-2007(13): Pinocchio&#039;s Walking Legs (which resemble<strong> Twig</strong>s) are Articles made out of Wood. Using this story you can remember both meanings for this kanji: article and<strong> twig</strong>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/philosophicalcat">philosophicalcat</a>] 1-2-2012(11): <strong>ARTICLE</strong> One of the Reforestation Act: No <em>walking legs</em> may crush a <em>tree</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavisMcDavis">DavisMcDavis</a>] 19-10-2008(9): In Japan,<strong> twig</strong>s are formed in a very unusual way: a whole tree is laid down, and a pair of walking legs goes back and forth over it, breaking the tree down further and further until it has broken down into<strong> twig</strong>s. [I had trouble remembering if the tree or the legs were on the bottom. This image places the tree underneath the walking legs.].

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Monkeys_Spiders">Monkeys_Spiders</a>] 30-1-2010(8): <strong>Twig</strong>? Nothing to do with this kanji I can find, perhaps a dead 70&#039;s culture meaning that slipped though the new editions? I&#039;m using keyword <strong>clause</strong>. There is a famous <em><strong>clause</strong></em> in the a law that made many protestors to climb all the trees around 10 Downing Street (or Whitehouse) and sit swinging their walking legs chanting &quot;Change the <strong>clause</strong>!&quot;. I see the PM (or President) staring at the <strong>clause</strong> ready to sign. Everyone referred to the whole shebang as &quot;the <strong>clause</strong>&quot;, all over a few words.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pangolin">Pangolin</a>] 29-7-2006(8): <strong>Twig</strong>? Not really, I&#039;m forced to rename this kanji <strong>article</strong>. The kind of <em>walking legs</em> that can march over a <em>tree</em> would have to be very well <strong>article</strong>-ated. gomen ^_^.
