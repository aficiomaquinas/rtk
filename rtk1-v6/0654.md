1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey">onsen_monkey</a>] 4-10-2006(325): When you get a good<strong> IDEA</strong> you get excited and you can hear the SOUND of your HEART, it&#039;s pounding so hard.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 11-10-2005(58): Picture someone who&#039;s just had a great<strong> idea</strong>, but in place of a blinking light bulb over their head, you see a <em>heart</em> thumping with great <em>noise</em>. Imagine the greater the<strong> idea</strong>, the louder the <em>sound</em> of the beating <em>heart</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 26-8-2007(38): The best<strong> idea</strong>s are <em>sound</em><strong> idea</strong>s that come right from the <em>heart</em>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Atomik">Atomik</a>] 14-2-2010(32): The Frenchman René-Théophile-Hyacinthe Laennec is best known for a great<strong> idea</strong> he had in 1816, when he invented a device to listen to the <em>sound</em> of a patient&#039;s <em>heart</em>: the stethoscope. Until then, doctors simply put their ears against people&#039;s chests, which was ineffective for overweight patients and embarrassing for female patients. Laennec&#039;s<strong> idea</strong> was so great that doctors still rely on it today.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aelirri">aelirri</a>] 14-5-2009(15): A good <strong>idea</strong> will always <em>sound</em> right in your heart.
