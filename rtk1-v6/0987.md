heisig: "This kanji has a pictographic resemblance to a number of grains of <b>rice</b> lying on a plate in the shape of a star."
commen: "* As a primitive, it keeps its meaning of <i>rice</i>, and is meant to connote a very ordinary, commonplace grain, in contrast to the primitive for <i>wheat</i> that we just learned. (This meaning accords well with Japan, where the output of <i>rice</i> far exceeds that of <i>wheat</i>.)
It occasionally takes a different shape when it stands on its own, or is joined to a line above. In this case, we shall have it refer specifically to <i>grains of rice</i>. This primitive is not to be confused with the similar-looking primitive for <i>water</i>. While the stroke orders are nearly alike, <i>grains of rice</i> has 5 strokes, while <i>water</i> only has 4 because it joins the second and third strokes into one.
Finally, we may note that by itself the kanji for <i>rice</i> is an abbreviation used for the <i>United States</i>, which can then also serve as an alternate reading for the main primitive form, if you so wish."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(154): Stroke order: I like to think of the first two strokes as “chop sticks” with which one eats the<strong> rice</strong>. The rest then is the “tree” meaning “plant” in this contexct. also: USA.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 19-12-2007(52): Two <em>drops</em> of<strong> rice</strong> in a <em>tree</em>, simple.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inaka_rob">inaka_rob</a>] 17-4-2012(23): 88! Japanese people think of this Kanji as 88. Each grain of<strong> rice</strong> holds 88 gods inside. Anyway, that is the origins of this kanji. It&#039;s easy to remember: Each grain of<strong> rice</strong> holds 88 gods. 八十八 written as one character. just remember one 八 is upside down.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 29-9-2006(10): Avoid <em>rice-grains</em> in stories that use the full 6-stroke 米 , use cups of<strong> rice</strong> instead. Reserve <em>rice-grains</em> for the abbreviated 5-stroke version as in <a href="../v4/932.html">lacquer</a> (#932 漆)漆 and <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/933">Esq.</a> (#933 様)様.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rinkuhero">rinkuhero</a>] 20-9-2011(9): <strong>Rice</strong> grows on trees in America.
