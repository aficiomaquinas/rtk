1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster">snallygaster</a>] 13-5-2008(145): Building on johnskb: Although it goes against the Heisig<strong> me</strong>thod, this story is a lot easier to remember when you know it&#039;s the kanji for &quot;boku.&quot; Males usually use either &quot;boku&quot; or &quot;ore&quot; (instead of &quot;watashi&quot;) to refer themselves. &quot;Boku&quot; is slightly boyish and soft; &quot;ore&quot; is rough &amp; tough. Mr. T would definitely use &quot;ore&quot; -- but when he&#039;s one of the husbands hung upside down in a row about to be punished by his wife, he puts on a sweet act and switches to &quot;boku&quot; when he pleads &quot;come on baby, it&#039;s<strong> ME</strong>!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 21-5-2006(112): Mr. T also finds himself as one of the HUSBANDs, whose wives have had them hung UPSIDE DOWN IN A ROW. But when his wife comes up to punish him, he pleads, “It’s<strong> ME</strong>, Baby. I wasn’t behaving badly like these other foo’s.”.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 28-5-2008(16): <strong>Me</strong> awaken to discover<strong> me</strong>self upside down over Mr. T&#039;s knee getting slapped. Does this make Mr. T<strong> me</strong> husband??

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 26-12-2006(11): <em>Row of upside down husbands</em> all begging <em>Mr T</em> to set them free...&quot;<strong>ME</strong>!<strong> ME</strong><strong> ME</strong>!&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 9-12-2006(5): <em>Mr T.</em> watches the <em>rowboat-overturning</em> <a href="../v4/1793">slap</a> (#1793 撲) from the shore and says, &quot;I&#039;m sure glad that ain&#039;t<strong> me</strong>&quot;.
