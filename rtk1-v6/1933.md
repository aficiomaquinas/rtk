1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster">snallygaster</a>] 13-5-2008(145): Building on johnskb: Although it goes against the Heisig<strong> me</strong>thod, this story is a lot easier to remember when you know it&#039;s the kanji for &quot;boku.&quot; Males usually use either &quot;boku&quot; or &quot;ore&quot; (instead of &quot;watashi&quot;) to refer themselves. &quot;Boku&quot; is slightly boyish and soft; &quot;ore&quot; is rough &amp; tough. Mr. T would definitely use &quot;ore&quot; -- but when he&#039;s one of the husbands hung upside down in a row about to be punished by his wife, he puts on a sweet act and switches to &quot;boku&quot; when he pleads &quot;come on baby, it&#039;s<strong> ME</strong>!&quot;.
