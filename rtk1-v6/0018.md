heisig: "Remember when you were young and your mother told you never to look directly into the <i>sun</i> for fear you might burn out your <i>eyes</i>? Probably you were foolish enough to <b>risk</b> a quick glance once or twice; but just as probably, you passed that bit of folk wisdom on to someone else as you grew older. Here, too, the kanji that has a <i>sun</i> above and an <i>eye</i> right below looking up at it has the meaning of <b>risk</b> (see frame 12)."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 21-7-2007(283): Don&#039;t look at the sun directly with your eyes, it&#039;s<strong> risk</strong>y!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/godcomplex">godcomplex</a>] 2-11-2007(55): You&#039;ll<strong> risk</strong> your eyesight if you look up at the sun.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36">laner36</a>] 19-5-2008(31): Looking up at the big sun is a<strong> risk</strong> to your eye. To remember that the sun primitive is bigger than the eye primitive, imagine making your eyes little (squinting) when you go out in the bright sun to reduce the<strong> risk</strong> of getting sun blindness. READING: imagine a kid saying &quot;oh that&#039;s ぼう (bull as in B.S.), looking at the sun is no<strong> risk</strong>!&quot; [he&#039;s blind now].

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 19-5-2008(14): Staring into the big <em>sun</em> can<strong> risk</strong> your <em>eye</em>sight! HINT: It looks like a pipe from Super Mario Bros. It might be<strong> risk</strong>y to go down it. :p.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne">sethimayne</a>] 25-9-2007(10): If you look at the <em>sun</em> high in the sky directly with your <em>eyes</em> below, you&#039;re taking a big<strong> risk</strong>.
