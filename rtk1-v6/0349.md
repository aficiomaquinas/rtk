primit: "brush(pedzel) This primitive element, not itself a kanji, is a pictograph of a writing brush. Let the first 3 strokes represent the hairs at the tip of the brush, and the following two strokes the thumb and forefinger that guide it when you write. Note how the long vertical stroke, cutting through everything, is drawn last. This is standard procedure when you have such a stroke running the length of a character. However, as we saw in the case of cow, when this primitive appears on top of another primitive, its &quot;tail&quot; is cut off, giving us D. [6]"
heisig: "The sage talks rapidly with his <i>tongue wagging in his mouth</i>, while the <i>brush</i> of the scribe runs apace to <b>write</b> down the master 'swords."
