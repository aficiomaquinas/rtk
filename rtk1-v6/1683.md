primit: "bushes Whatever image you contrived for the character meaning hedge (FRAME 154 垣), choose something different and clearly distinguishable for this primitive for bushes. The element itself differs from that for grow up only in the extension of the single vertical stroke beneath the final horizontal stroke and in the order of writing. Though we shall meet only one instance of it in this chapter and one more later on, it is worth noting that when this element appears on the side, the final stroke is sloped somewhat to the left: §. [4]"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 6-3-2010(218): &quot;Walking legs&quot; over &quot;bushes&quot; needs to have a primitive meaning of its own. It appears in several kanji, such as 縫 <a href="../v4/1563.html">sew</a> (#1563 縫), 逢 <a href="../v4/2417.html">tryst</a> (#2417 逢), 蜂 <a href="../v4/2687.html">bee</a> (#2687 蜂), and 鋒 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2768">sword's point</a> (#2768 鋒), and it is clumsy to work bushes and walking legs into every story. &quot;Pointy&quot; works fairly well: the walking legs are stuck on top of the pointy part of the bush; and for this character: a <strong>summit</strong> is the <em>pointy</em> end of a <em>mountain</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 17-4-2008(72): Moses climbs to the<strong> summit</strong> of the mountain using his walking legs to talk to the burning bush.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crayonmaster">crayonmaster</a>] 17-5-2009(57): If you are using the &quot;walking legs + bushes = pubic hair&quot; primitive... The nudist colony was banished to the top of the mountain&#039;s<strong> summit</strong>, so that nobody would have to see their bushes again!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 3-1-2007(27): Like in the next frame, the right side element is &quot;walking through bushes&quot;. This time they&#039;re not on the road, but on a mountain, whose<strong> summit</strong> you&#039;re trying to reach. (the element will come in at least 逢 again).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 16-8-2009(16): <em>Bush</em> between <em>walking legs</em> = <em>pubic hair</em>!
