1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 3-9-2007(170): <em>Mr. T</em> gets a <strong>stipend</strong> every month if he stays <em>dedicated</em> to his temple training, a very hard thing for the impatient T.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 19-4-2008(28): People who are highly dedicated to their jobs get good salaries/stipends.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavin.schultz-ohkubo">gavin.schultz-ohkubo</a>] 17-6-2010(15): You must be kidding... yet another source of confusion, with <a href="../v4/893">earnings</a> (#893 稼), <a href="../v4/1349">salary</a> (#1349 給), <a href="../v4/473">assets</a> (#473 資), <a href="../v4/194">savings</a> (#194 貯) and <a href="../v4/1510">income</a> (#1510 収). A<strong> stipend</strong>, in English at least, has a connotation of only a small regular payment. Despite a life of <em>dedication</em>, <em>P</em> has to go back to a simple life of tending to <em>bonsai</em> and growing <em>corn</em> after he retires with only a small monthly<strong> stipend</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the_marshal">the_marshal</a>] 25-7-2006(12): Mr. T triked the botanic intruction institute into thinking that he dedicated his whole like in bonsai and corn research. He even manage to get a<strong> stipend</strong> from that institute. In fact he&#039;s not dedicated at all when it comes to bonsai or corn... he only water them once in a while.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 7-5-2007(10): The<strong> stipend</strong> is given to a <em>person</em> who is very <em>dedicated</em> to his bonsai art so he can study more.
