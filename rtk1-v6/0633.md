2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dizzwave">dizzwave</a>] 17-6-2008(28): Have you ever worked in a<strong> warehouse</strong>? It&#039;s like a giant metal <em>cave</em>. Watch out for that <em>forklift</em>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 8-4-2009(17): With rents high and auto businesses failing, GM chose to use a <em>cave</em> as a<strong> warehouse</strong> for their unsold <em>cars</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/damichan">damichan</a>] 8-3-2009(9): I have a secret<strong> warehouse</strong>, set in a cliff cave, with a beautiful view of a turquoise ocean. That&#039;s where I keep my Lambhorginis, Ferraris, etc.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xxinde">xxinde</a>] 30-3-2010(7): This <em>cave</em> was meant to house a <em>car</em>, but is used as a<strong> warehouse</strong> for varios things... and stuff. If there were a car ( 車庫 ), it would make it a garage.
