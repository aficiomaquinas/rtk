1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 8-3-2007(135): At the <em>butcher&#039;s meeting</em>, all the butcher&#039;s who have a <em>heart disease</em> attend the faith<strong> healing</strong> workshop.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 1-12-2009(90): Note: <em>meeting of butchers + heart</em> are later combined into 愈 <a href="../v4/2433">in the nick of time</a> (#2433 愈). Story: For<strong> healing</strong> to take place, you must catch the <em>sickness in the nick of time</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hinode">Hinode</a>] 22-3-2009(61): (Think rpg!) We were in dire need of<strong> healing</strong>. Our party was fighting the <em>cavemen</em>, but we didn&#039;t fare too well. It was more like a <em>butcher&#039;s meeting</em> than a fight... just as they were about to pierce my <em>heart</em>, luckily a priest came along and used his<strong> healing</strong> spell <a href="../v4/2433">in the nick of time</a> (#2433 愈).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 12-7-2009(31): <strong>Healing</strong> from <em>sickness</em> often comes just <a href="../v4/2433">in the nick of time</a> (#2433 愈), especially during boss battles.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 23-12-2008(22): A <em>caveman</em><strong> healing</strong> <em>butchers</em> with <em>heart</em> disease by pulling their <em>hearts</em> out.
