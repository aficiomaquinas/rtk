heisig: "<i>Rake</i> . . . <i>rice</i> . . . <i>fenceposts</i>. Take special care to draw this character in the same order as the primitive. Note too, that the fourth stroke for <i>rice</i> is already taken care of by the fourth stroke of <i>rake</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 11-9-2007(261): Even though it&#039;s a maddening task, the monks stay <strong>solemn</strong> as they rake <em>rice</em> between the <em>fenceposts</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 7-4-2008(169): <strong>Note:</strong> This is not <em>sieve</em> as it has a full <em>rice</em> and not <em>rice grains</em> and the hook is missing from <em>rake</em>. Also the given stroke order is incorrect (<em>fenceposts</em> should come last).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 27-6-2009(42): This is a zen rice garden. It is different from rock garden in only one aspect. Here you see <em>raked</em> white <em>rice</em> between the <em>fenceposts</em>. In<strong> solemn</strong> silence the monks rake rice every morning.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/plumage">plumage</a>] 7-4-2009(22): The RICE thrown at the wedding must be RAKED up before the<strong> SOLEMN</strong> funeral procession enters between the FENCE POSTS.
