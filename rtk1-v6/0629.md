1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amthomas">amthomas</a>] 10-1-2007(147): A nice picnic <em>pent up</em> in the<strong> park</strong>, with your <em>crock pot</em> and <em>scarf</em> (picnic blanket).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 17-6-2006(48): You&#039;re walking in the<strong> park</strong> and a little ways off the path there is a “pent in” lidded crock on a scarf. Just picture it and it should work. You may also imagine the lidded crock family is having a picnic in the<strong> park</strong>, and &#039;baby lidded crock&#039; was left alone in its pen/playpen, wearing a scarf (or sleeping on a scarf).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zodiac">zodiac</a>] 5-11-2008(41): In the<strong> park</strong>, I discovered a <em>lidded crock wrapped with a scarf</em>. The police promptly <em>pent</em> it up. (lidded crock wrapped in scarf = fake bomb, look at first story in <a href="../v4/402">distant</a> (#402 遠)).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethg">sethg</a>] 3-3-2009(21): This is just like the <em>lidded crock</em> wrapped in a <em>scarf</em> you had to stay <a href="../v4/402">distant</a> (#402 遠) from. This time it&#039;s even more dangerous, because it&#039;s <em>pent in</em> the sandbox in the<strong> park</strong>, where children play. Who knows what could be inside! Hopefully it&#039;s something as harmless as a <a href="../v4/403">monkey</a> (#403 猿) this time. Who would put something so potentially dangerous in a<strong> park</strong>, anyway?

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koiulpoi">koiulpoi</a>] 28-6-2009(12): When wearing a nice <em>long kimono</em>, the best thing to do is to go visit the<strong> park</strong> (which is obviously hedged in), and show off your stuff.
