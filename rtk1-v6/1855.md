1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 30-1-2007(202): An injured <em>body part</em> may <strong>swell</strong>. It will begin to throb like a bass <em>drum</em> and will change <em>shape</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 10-5-2006(62): If a PART OF your BODY begins to<strong> SWELL</strong> and resembles the SHAPE of a bass DRUM, you’re either pregnant or in desperate need of a diet.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 23-2-2008(38): This kanji does not mean<strong> swell</strong> as in a inflammation. There is a different kanji for that meaning ( 腫れる ). This kanji means<strong> swell</strong> as in, a tire<strong> swell</strong>ing/expanding, your income<strong> swell</strong>ing/expanding, dough<strong> swell</strong>ing/expanding, etc. Johnskb&#039;s story is best b/c it does not involve<strong> swell</strong>ing in the sense of inflammation, just general expansion of the stomach. STORY: &quot;If a PART OF your BODY begins to<strong> SWELL</strong>/EXPAND and resembles the SHAPE of a bass DRUM, you’re either pregnant or in desperate need of a diet.&quot;.
