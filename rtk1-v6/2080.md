1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 22-5-2006(203): Knowing<strong> ZEN</strong>’s emphasis on “nothingness,” it’s not hard to envision a<strong> ZEN</strong> ALTAR being quite clean and SIMPLE.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 13-1-2006(42): <em>Simple-minded blond girl</em> (see frame 1928) is very good at<strong> Zen</strong>, which isn&#039;t surprising since she doesn&#039;t think much. She has this bad habit of meditating perched on the main temple <em>altar</em>, which infuriates the<strong> Zen</strong> buddhists. When they get up to her and tell her rudely to step down the <em>altar</em>, she just smiles and teases them : &quot;Not very<strong> zen</strong> are you ?&quot;. Who would have thought <em>simple-minded blond girl</em> would teach the<strong> Zen</strong> buddhists a lesson !

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mairov">mairov</a>] 13-3-2008(27): The<strong> Zen</strong> altar is really simple.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonny_wonny">jonny_wonny</a>] 23-6-2009(22): Because<strong> Zen</strong> is so <em>simple</em>, you don&#039;t need an <em>alter</em>, just a quiet place to sit.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hoticehunter">Hoticehunter</a>] 16-3-2012(8): Guys, if you&#039;re just going to make your story some variation of &quot;Zen altars are simple&quot;, do you really need to share it publicly? There&#039;s 100 other stories saying exactly the same thing. You don&#039;t need to check the &quot;share this story&quot; box for every story you make. Don&#039;t make people wade through 100 stories that are exactly the same just to find the one that&#039;s different and works for them.
