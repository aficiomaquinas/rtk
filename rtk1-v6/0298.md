heisig: "Here we see a <i>crossing</i> in the form of a barbed <i>fishhook</i>, suggesting a <b>swifter</b> alternate not only to the roundabouts used in Europe but also to the &quot;cloverleaf&quot; design used on superhighways in the United States."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jezerey">jezerey</a>] 11-2-2008(219): The car went too<strong> swift</strong>ly through the crossing and was hooked by the cops.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mbagsh55">mbagsh55</a>] 13-9-2007(74): In the Heisig version of Frogger, you can image <em>ten</em> giant <em>fish hooks</em> sweeping across the <em>road</em>, with our hapless hero &#039;froggy&#039; forced to make a<strong> swift</strong> crossing or end up as fish bait.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KANJI">KANJI</a>] 10-10-2006(37): Indy Jones imperative: Be<strong> SWIFT</strong> at the <strong>CROSSING</strong> or you&#039;ll be <strong>HOOKED</strong>. (How many times have we seen Indy Jones defy death. But is he so quick and nimble to conquer the travails on the road through RTK?).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joxn_costello">joxn_costello</a>] 21-11-2008(36): If you spread <em>fishguts</em> all over a <em>crossing</em>, people will definitely want to cross over it very <strong>swiftly</strong> to get away from the awful smell!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cellophane">cellophane</a>] 5-12-2007(25): You cannot simply walk across a busy <em>crossing</em> - you must be far<strong> swift</strong>er than that to avoid being squished by the traffic. Instead, you need a piece of Link&#039;s gear - a <em>fish-hook</em>-shot, to grab onto a railing on the other side and pull you across in time.
