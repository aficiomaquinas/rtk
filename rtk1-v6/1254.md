heisig: "In forming an image for the key word, it is helpful to know that this kanji is used for artistic representations (like a completed painting), and as a counter for the number of <b>brush-strokes</b> in a character (as, for instance, in Indexes II and III at the end of this book). Its elements are: <i>ceiling</i> . . . <i>sprout</i> . . . <i>shovel</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 20-6-2006(180): You decide one day to paint a kanji on your ceiling. Unfortunately, you don’t have a brush, so, being innovative, you use a sprout. Knowing it could be messy, you search for a drop-cloth, but can’t find one. Instead, you put a shovel down on the floor to catch any drips resulting from the BRUSH-STROKEs.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 17-9-2007(77): To paint a kanji in your <em>ceiling</em> with only natural materials, you use a <em>sprout</em> as a <strong>brush</strong> and <em>shovel</em> some dirt to use as paint for your <strong>strokes</strong>. [modified from johnskb&#039;s].

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chully">chully</a>] 7-4-2009(46): Start with just <em>one</em> stroke. Soon more will <em>sprout</em>, and then you end up with a whole <em>shovel</em>full!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cingold">cingold</a>] 9-10-2009(37): The first kanji I learnt was just <em>one</em><strong> brush stroke</strong>, but then my knowledge <em>sprouted</em> and I knew a <em>shovel</em>ful.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 12-1-2008(28): New age artist. The canvas is on the <em>ceiling</em>. The floor is covered with bean <em>sprouts</em>. The artist takes a <em>shovel</em> and makes a sweeping motion on the ground, sending a stream of sprouts flying up to the ceiling and sticking to the canvas in strange patterns. &quot;This is radical calligraphy,&quot; he says, panting for breath, &quot;and the act of shoveling is my new-age equivalent of the classical<strong> brush stroke</strong>.&quot;.
