heisig: "You've no doubt seen cattails, those swamp <b>reeds</b> with a furry <i>flower</i> to them like the tail of a cat. This might just turn out to be a good way to get rid of a troublesome <i>pack of wild dogs</i>: lure them into a swamp of these <b>reeds</b> with the cattail <i>flowers</i> and then set <i>fire</i> to the swamp. Take care to focus on the <i>flower</i> rather than the &quot;cattail&quot; to avoid confusion with frame 259 below."

They misunderstood something they overheard, and can&#039;t understand why they&#039;re not getting high smoking<strong> reed</strong>. In the kanji, you can actually see the dog smoking the<strong> reed</strong> in a crack pipe held over the fire. (Thanks, chamcham!).
