You do the math in your head and it comes out to two <em>cocoons</em> per <em>person</em>. This is why the horizontal line is a fraction bar with two <em>cocoons</em> on the top, and one <em>person</em> the bottom.

They are the two <em>cocoon</em>s that determine <strong>how many</strong> people are attending the fiesta. So<strong> how many</strong> were there? The answer is displayed on an <strong>abacus</strong>.
