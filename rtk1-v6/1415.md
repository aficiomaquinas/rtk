1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 7-11-2006(317): With my <em>fingers</em>, I punch in my bank code and<strong> withdraw</strong> some money from my account. And now it&#039;s <em>empty</em> again, as usual!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 12-12-2007(77): If you find yourself in a fight with a karate master with no weapons or martial art skills, just your <em>empty fingers</em>, you should<strong> withdraw</strong> because 空手 (karate=&quot;empty hand&quot;) is more powerful than 控 (=&quot;empty fingers&quot;).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/senorsmile">senorsmile</a>] 2-3-2008(22): <strong>WITHDRAW</strong> your FINGERS from the cookie jar if it is already EMPTY.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 17-1-2007(20): As in Aesop&#039;s fable: the monkey puts its hand in a jar to get a piece of fruit, but now it can&#039;t pull its hand out. It will have to empty its fingers before it can<strong> withdraw</strong> its hand.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shang">shang</a>] 1-6-2009(17): This is a bit of an odd keyword choice from Heisig. &quot;<strong>Withhold</strong>&quot; would work a lot better considering how this kanji is used. As in restrain/hold yourself back ( 控える ) or withhold/deduct taxes ( 控除 ) or withholding a spare/reserve copy ( 控え ).
