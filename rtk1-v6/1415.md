1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 7-11-2006(317): With my <em>fingers</em>, I punch in my bank code and<strong> withdraw</strong> some money from my account. And now it&#039;s <em>empty</em> again, as usual!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 12-12-2007(77): If you find yourself in a fight with a karate master with no weapons or martial art skills, just your <em>empty fingers</em>, you should<strong> withdraw</strong> because 空手 (karate=&quot;empty hand&quot;) is more powerful than 控 (=&quot;empty fingers&quot;).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/senorsmile">senorsmile</a>] 2-3-2008(22): <strong>WITHDRAW</strong> your FINGERS from the cookie jar if it is already EMPTY.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 17-1-2007(20): As in Aesop&#039;s fable: the monkey puts its hand in a jar to get a piece of fruit, but now it can&#039;t pull its hand out. It will have to empty its fingers before it can<strong> withdraw</strong> its hand.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shang">shang</a>] 1-6-2009(17): This is a bit of an odd keyword choice from Heisig. &quot;<strong>Withhold</strong>&quot; would work a lot better considering how this kanji is used. As in restrain/hold yourself back ( 控える ) or withhold/deduct taxes ( 控除 ) or withholding a spare/reserve copy ( 控え ).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 26-5-2010(15): Best<strong> WITHDRAW</strong> from a fight with the Karate master, because <em>Empty Fingers</em> 控 is no match for Empty Hand 空手 (Karate)! ........[Great story mspertus!!! I just changed the order for my own use].

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genevere">genevere</a>] 27-4-2009(9): If your fingers are empty (no weapon) you should<strong> withdraw</strong> from the fight.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cezpeleta">cezpeleta</a>] 23-11-2009(7): I<strong> withdraw</strong> my FINGERS from the EMPTY cookie jar :(.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 3-10-2006(6): <strong>Fingers</strong>, the thief, as usual tries to <em>withdraw</em> all the money from my account. I&#039;ve beat him to it this time! He finds my account is already <strong>empty</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johngwk">johngwk</a>] 2-3-2011(4): If I<strong> withdraw</strong> my <em>fingers</em> from the hole,it will be <em>empty</em>.
