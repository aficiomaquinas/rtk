heisig: "Just as the Arabic numeral &quot;8&quot; is composed of a small circle followed by a larger one, so the kanji for <b>eight</b> is composed of a short line followed by a longer line, slanting towards it but not touching it. And just as the &quot;lazy 8&quot; is the mathematical symbol for &quot;infinity,&quot; so the expanse opened up below these two strokes is associated by the Japanese with the sense of an infinite expanse or something &quot;all-encompassing.&quot;"
