heisig: "If you take care to remember the stroke order of this kanji, you will not have trouble later keeping it distinct from the kanji for <i>power</i> (Frame 922)."
commen: "* As a primitive, we shall use this kanji to mean <i>baseball team</i> or simply <i>baseball</i>. The meaning, of course, is derived from the <i>nine</i> players who make up a team."
