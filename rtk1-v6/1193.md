1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kyldyyr">kyldyyr</a>] 25-11-2005(176): An absurd image, but what the heck - worked for me. Imagine a <em>car</em> going across a plain at a fast speed. Suddenly a single <em>sprout</em> (the only one to be seen) gets stuck to the car&#039;s wheels, causing the car to fly around its<strong> axis</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 4-3-2007(130): The Germans manufactured so many <em>cars</em> during World War II that it was almost as if they were <em>sprouting</em> from the factories of the<strong> Axis</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 13-12-2007(51): Left side is the car, right side is a zoomed in picture of the car showing the detail of the axle/axis.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 30-12-2007(27): George W. Bush placed a great deal of Middle Eastern countries in his &quot;<strong>Axis</strong> of Evil&quot; ... perhaps because that region is the <em>sprouting origin</em> of what we have to put into our <em>cars</em> (let&#039;s bring back the electric car, eh?).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/etpan">etpan</a>] 23-11-2008(25): James Bond has guns that <em>sprout</em> from the wheel <strong>axes</strong> of his <em>car</em>.
