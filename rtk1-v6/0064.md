heisig: "What we have to do here is turn a <i>shellfish</i> into a <b>page</b> of a book. The <i>one</i> at the top tells us that we only get a rather short book, in fact only <i>one</i> <b>page</b>. Imagine a title printed on the shell of an <i>oyster</i>, let us say &quot;Pearl of Wisdom,&quot; and then open the quaint book to its <i>one</i> and only <b>page</b>, on which you find a single, radiant <i>drop of</i> wisdom, one of the masterpiece poems of nature."
commen: "* As a primitive, this kanji takes the unrelated meaning of a <i>head</i> (preferably one detached from its body), derived from the character for <i>head</i> (Frame 1549)."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 8-10-2007(237): A <em>shellfish</em> carrying a<strong> page</strong> balanced on its <em>head</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narazumono">narazumono</a>] 27-8-2008(103): <em>One</em> <em>drop</em> of ink from a <em>shellfish</em> can fill a whole<strong> page</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thatkidpercy">thatkidpercy</a>] 16-11-2007(58): A <em>shellfish</em> dangles from the <em>ceiling</em> Mission-Impossible style, desperate to recover the<strong> page</strong> of revealing images that were taken from him.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 9-10-2011(29): 頁岩 , 頁 , <a href="../v4/60.html">page</a> (#60 頁) ケツ, ページ ... Parts: 一 , 丶, 自 , ハor 一 , 丶, 貝 (cf: 順番 , お願い , 頭 , 頂く , etc.) ... Tip: This is a never used Kanji, but you are going to see it a few hundred more times in RTK as a primitive. Here&#039;s something that I figured out way too late. This is <em>ALWAYS</em> <em>ALWAYS</em> on the right hand side (RHS) of the characters it is a part of. <em>Always</em>.. Learn this primitive cold, and remember, always on the RHS.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuki11">Tsuki11</a>] 29-10-2007(29): <em>One</em><strong> page</strong> may not seem like much, but if it contains <em>drop</em> of wisdom, it is worth the <em>clams</em> you <em>shell</em>ed out for it.
