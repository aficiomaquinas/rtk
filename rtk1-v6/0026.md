heisig: "This kanji is actually a picture of the first flower of the day, which we shall, in defiance of botanical science, call the <i>sun</i>flower, since it begins with the element for <i>sun</i> and is held upon a stem with leaves (the pictographic representation of the final two strokes). This time, however, we shall ignore the pictograph and imagine <i>sun</i>flowers with <i>needles</i> for stems, which can be plucked and used to darn your socks. The sense of <b>early</b> is easily remembered if one thinks of the <i>sun</i>flower as the <b>early</b> riser in the garden, because the <i>sun</i>, showing favoritism towards its namesake, shines on it before all the others (see frame 10)."
commen: "* As a primitive element, this kanji takes the meaning of <i>sunflower</i>, which was used to make the abstract key word <i>early</i> more graphic."
