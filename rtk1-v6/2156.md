1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 3-11-2006(150): Picture an ad in which Uncle Jimbo (of &quot;South Park&quot; fame)<strong> recommend</strong>s the latest craze in deer hunting : a high tech <em>slingshot</em>! The ad begins with Bambi prancing around, smelling the <em>flowers</em>. Then, all of a sudden, Bambi is brutally murdered with the <em>slingshot</em>, put on the <em>cooking fire</em>, and the camera pans to Uncle Jimbo happily munching on crispy cooked Bambi! Note: the <em>slingshot</em> is strokes 11-12.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 7-1-2007(142): It is<strong> recommend</strong>ed that deers stick to eating flowers. If they try to eat birds, they may end up choking on them, like this one here. Note that the head ( 白 ) is gone and the visible part of the body which is normally written with a stroke of the head must by necessity be drawn with a stroke of the tail.

It is very special because it has been fed with flowers all it&#039;s life, has been killed with a slingshot (so there is no gun powder in it) and right now it is in the cooking fire. The meaning:<strong> recommend</strong>; mat; advise; encourage; offer.
