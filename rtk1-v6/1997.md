primit: "drag Althoughnot a pictograph in the strict sense, this primitive depicts one stroke pulling another along behind it. Note how it differs from cliff and person because of this dragging effect,not to mention the fact that the first stroke is written right to left, almost as if it were a long drop. When this element comes under a different element, the strokes are drawn apart like this: --. [2]"
heisig: "Dragging . . . ten eyes."
