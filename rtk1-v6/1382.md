1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fightswumbrellas">fightswumbrellas</a>] 5-12-2009(36): Footprint: In the pirate(=leg) religion, footprints are important because they lead to treasure.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 24-12-2010(24): The <strong>trail</strong> of the <em>wooden leg religion</em> was very easy to follow, since all its followers have wooden legs.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 25-3-2011(17): <strong>Footprint</strong>: You can actually tell a pirates <em>religion</em> by the shape of their <strong>footprint</strong>. Catholic pirates have crucifix shaped peg legs, jewish ones have david&#039;s star, and muslim ones have crescent moon and star peg legs. PS Is anyone else finding all of the supplement keywords to be really poorly chosen?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Phlail">Phlail</a>] 1-9-2012(11): Note: If you are using the 6th edition of RTK, the keywords (person...soil...compass...taskmaster) are completely wrong! The key words are <em>leg</em>...<em>religion</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 21-10-2010(9): The disappearance 失踪 しっそう of the pirate, leaving nothing but footprints and a <em>wooden leg</em>, inspired a strange new <em>religion</em> about Bluebeard&#039;s resurrection and ascension.
