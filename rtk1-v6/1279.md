1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 3-8-2006(294): This particular form of<strong> transit</strong> is a ferry (one of the actual meanings of this character). Naturally it can only cross the <em>water</em> if it&#039;s not frozen, so the temperature must be above 0 <em>degrees</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 15-7-2007(29): The<strong> transit</strong> system in Tokyo is one of the best in the wrold, but why is it that when it is 35 degrees outside, it is about 2 degrees on the train? Or when it is 2 degrees outside, it is 35 degrees inside the train. This degree of difference means I am always sweating then getting the chills! I think I caught a fever!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 16-3-2009(25): Hint: This is most commonly used in わたる, meaning to cross (a river etc) - most of the other readings are fairly obscure. I guess Heisig didn&#039;t use that because of the earlier &#039;crossing&#039; kanji, but there we go. Story: the Dwarves who live in the Arctic caverns develop a<strong> transit</strong> system (perhaps of husky drawn carts) on the frozen <em>water</em> when its -20 <em>degrees</em> so they can cross to the other caverns.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 20-12-2007(22): This kanji becomes a snap when you think of a surveyor&#039;s instrument called a<strong> transit</strong>! The<strong> transit</strong> has a small, curved <em>liquid</em> tube (with an air bubble) and a scale marked in <em>degrees</em> so you can tell if something is level or not.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-10-2008(11): <em>Water</em> may change several <em>degrees</em> during<strong> transit</strong>.
