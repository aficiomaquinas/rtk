1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 3-8-2006(294): This particular form of<strong> transit</strong> is a ferry (one of the actual meanings of this character). Naturally it can only cross the <em>water</em> if it&#039;s not frozen, so the temperature must be above 0 <em>degrees</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 15-7-2007(29): The<strong> transit</strong> system in Tokyo is one of the best in the wrold, but why is it that when it is 35 degrees outside, it is about 2 degrees on the train? Or when it is 2 degrees outside, it is 35 degrees inside the train. This degree of difference means I am always sweating then getting the chills! I think I caught a fever!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 16-3-2009(25): Hint: This is most commonly used in わたる, meaning to cross (a river etc) - most of the other readings are fairly obscure. I guess Heisig didn&#039;t use that because of the earlier &#039;crossing&#039; kanji, but there we go. Story: the Dwarves who live in the Arctic caverns develop a<strong> transit</strong> system (perhaps of husky drawn carts) on the frozen <em>water</em> when its -20 <em>degrees</em> so they can cross to the other caverns.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 20-12-2007(22): This kanji becomes a snap when you think of a surveyor&#039;s instrument called a<strong> transit</strong>! The<strong> transit</strong> has a small, curved <em>liquid</em> tube (with an air bubble) and a scale marked in <em>degrees</em> so you can tell if something is level or not.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-10-2008(11): <em>Water</em> may change several <em>degrees</em> during<strong> transit</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tuuli">tuuli</a>] 17-2-2008(7): The best<strong> transit</strong> system can take you 360 <em>degrees</em> around the world, even over <em>water</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert">nesert</a>] 28-6-2010(6): <em>Water</em><strong> transit</strong> uses <em>degrees</em> of longitude and latitude...

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Artur83">Artur83</a>] 16-4-2009(4): <em>Wasser</em>stellen unter 0<em>Grad</em> kann man trockenen Fußes <strong>überqueren</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Melamelachan">Melamelachan</a>] 9-5-2012(3): The<strong> transit</strong> shown here is over the river Styx, into the underworld of antiquity. Frequently asked questions: Yes, the Styx is really just <em>water</em>. No, the Greek underworld is not like Hell. In particular, the temperature is a pleasant 20 <em>degrees</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 22-11-2009(3): In spring the migrating birds wait until the thermometer reaches 20 <em>degrees</em> celsius before crossing (<strong>transit</strong>ting) the <em>water</em> to their summer breeding grounds - 渡り = migration. HINT: This kanji means &quot;to cross&quot; (a road, river etc.). I suppose Heisig chose<strong> transit</strong> to avoid confusion with <a href="../v4/279">crossing</a> (#279 辻) i.e. crossroads.
