heisig: "<i>Sheep</i> . . . <i>water</i> . . . <i>yawn/lack</i>. Although this character looks rather simple, special care should be taken in learning it because of the proximity of the final two elements to the character for <i>next</i>, which we learned in frame 510. Note, too, that the <i>water</i> comes UNDER the <i>sheep</i>, rather than on its own to the left."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 11-10-2005(289): A very thirsty sheep, who always <em>lacked</em> <em>water</em>, spends his days watching his fellow <em>sheep</em> (in the farm next door or in another pen) and being very<strong> envious</strong> of their <em>water</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtstutz">dtstutz</a>] 11-1-2008(153): <strong>Envious</strong> of the greener grass on the other side of the fence, the <strong>sheep</strong> looks down in disgust at his own dry grass <strong>lacking water</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the_marshal">the_marshal</a>] 27-9-2007(42): Some ppl have to try things like counting SHEEP or DRINKING a glass of water before they can sleep. Some other can just YAWN and fall asleep... you can be<strong> ENVIOUS</strong> of those one.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/squeaky_lill_mk">squeaky_lill_mk</a>] 5-5-2009(37): A <em>sheep</em> that <em>lacks </em> <em>water</em> is<strong> envious</strong> of those who have it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/natemb">natemb</a>] 6-6-2008(21): Unlike cotton, wool is warm even when wet, because it wicks water away from the skin. Many animals have cool adaptations and abilities that I wish I had, but I am most<strong> envious</strong> of <em>sheep</em>, because even if they get wet on the outside, the <em>water</em> is <em>lacking</em> UNDERNEATH. (helps to remember the water-lack part goes on the bottom).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 7-10-2008(10): Imagine a <em>sheep</em> living in the desert who, on top of <em>lacking water</em>, is<strong> envious</strong> of the camels who can go for days without it.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/annabel398">annabel398</a>] 4-1-2009(8): Wow, even with my very sketchy exposure to the Bible, this strikes me as a perfect picture of Psalm 100: The Lord is my <em>Sheep</em>-herd, I will not <em>lack</em>, he maketh me to lie down beside still <em>waters</em>. Still haven&#039;t figured out how to tie this in with <strong>envious</strong>, though... Maybe with the 10th commandment, thou shalt not covet (be<strong> envious</strong>) ?

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/walexander5">walexander5</a>] 22-9-2008(7): <strong>Envious</strong> as I was of my neighbor&#039;s prize winning <em>sheep</em>, I decided one night to <em>drown</em> him in his bed while he slept, as he opened his mouth to <em>yawn</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Fujiwara">Fujiwara</a>] 25-8-2009(6): &quot;I&#039;m not<strong> envious</strong>,&quot;, says the<strong> envious</strong> farmer, &quot; but my <em>sheep</em> would have come out on top if it hadn&#039;t been for the <em>lack of water</em>.&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SakanaUshi">SakanaUshi</a>] 3-8-2007(5): Not to be blasphemous, but I turned the sheep into Jesus. In this kanji, Jesus is walking on water, yawning at the simplicity of it all.
