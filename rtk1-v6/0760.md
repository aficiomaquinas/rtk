1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 10-1-2007(143): A good<strong> friend</strong> is always at your side. ---- I teach at a Japanese High School, and I often see chummy male students grabbing each other&#039;s crotches in a joking manner. It&#039;s still weird to me, but apparently reaching to your side and grabbing you neighbor&#039;s crotch is a great way to express<strong> friend</strong>ship.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nakome">nakome</a>] 4-3-2008(111): Think of a sex<strong> friend</strong> (a fuck buddy if you will). The benefit of such a relationship is that there will always be a <em>crotch by your side</em>. (the Japanese refer to such a<strong> friend</strong> as セフレ, just as we do).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 24-10-2006(64): <strong>Friend</strong>s with benefits anyone?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lizzie">Lizzie</a>] 18-8-2008(32): A<strong> friend</strong> is always on your side - again and again and again.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 27-12-2007(32): Your best<strong> friend</strong> is your crotch. Its always by your side and never lets you down.
