heisig: "The pictograph hidden in this character is of someone yawning. The first stroke shows the head thrown back; the second, the arm bent at the elbow as the hand reaches up to cover the mouth; and the last two, the legs. Since yawning shows a <b>lack</b> of something (psychologically, interest; physiologically, sleep), the connection is plain to see."
primit: "As a primitive, it can mean either yawn or lack."

He just stands there locking stupid while blowing (467) bubblegum and yawning. When he tries to cook (468), he almost always burns down the kitchen.
