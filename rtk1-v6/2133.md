heisig: "<i>Team of horses</i> . . . <i>phrase</i>. In American slang, a <b>pony</b> is an underground translation of a classical text, which students who cannot manage the difficult <i>phrases</i> of the original language consult and pass on from one generation to the next."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 23-4-2007(207): The cute little innocent-looking plastic <strong>pony</strong> on the desk of a student is in fact a <em>trojan horse</em>, hiding <em>phrases</em> in its belly which are used for cheating during an exam. No <strong>pony</strong> will be permitted on desks during tests!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 26-10-2007(94): A particular My Little<strong> Pony</strong> has a string that when you pull it, it repeats the same dumb phrase like &quot;I love you&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Balaam">Balaam</a>] 7-2-2008(28): A phrase used to insult horses - is<strong> pony</strong>. They hate that.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/WithLoveFromExIA">WithLoveFromExIA</a>] 20-6-2009(15): Lisa Simpson often utters the <em>phrase</em> &quot;Can I have a<strong> pony</strong>? Can I have a<strong> pony</strong>? Can I have a<strong> pony</strong>?&quot;. Finally Marge snaps &quot;No, not until you&#039;re older!&quot; &quot;But mum, it will be a <em>horse</em> by then.&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 17-3-2008(12): The<strong> Pony</strong> Express was a quick mail delivery service in old America. It actually used horses, not ponies, but the <em>phrase</em> &quot;Pony Express&quot; sounded better than &quot;Horse Express&quot;, and so they chose the better-sounding phrase as a marketing gimmick.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mary_K">Mary_K</a>] 10-5-2009(10): If a <em>team of horses</em> is a novel, then a <em>pony</em> is a <em>phrase</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 7-5-2008(7): Here we have a cute little innocent-looking plastic<strong> pony</strong> on the desk of a student, being in fact a <em>trojan horse</em>, hiding <em>phrases</em> in its belly which are used for cheating during an exam. -- Note that the kanji does in fact refer to a small horse, but the play on words help with this kanji and the story retains the image of a small horse.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 4-8-2008(6): This kanji is also commonly used to mean &quot;piece,&quot; such as a syougi piece. As we all know, unlike chess that uses crafted pieces, syougi pieces are like little<strong> PONY</strong>&#039;S that carry Chinese character PHRASES on them (such as 王 ) to convey what piece they are.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 21-6-2009(5): Bad choice of keyword. The main meaning for this character is こま a piece in the game of 将棋 (Japanese chess). But if you use that, be careful, you&#039;ll have to change 棋 <a href="../v4/1763">chess piece</a> (#1763 棋) which is another poor choice of keyword (it refers to strategy games in general not physical pieces). Sometimes it feels like Heisig is trying to be confusing on purpose.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lisbet">lisbet</a>] 23-12-2011(4): The new My Little <strong>Ponies</strong> show is all about magic <em>horses</em> who utter cute catch <em>phrases</em>.
