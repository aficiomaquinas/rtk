1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 23-4-2007(207): The cute little innocent-looking plastic <strong>pony</strong> on the desk of a student is in fact a <em>trojan horse</em>, hiding <em>phrases</em> in its belly which are used for cheating during an exam. No <strong>pony</strong> will be permitted on desks during tests!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 26-10-2007(94): A particular My Little<strong> Pony</strong> has a string that when you pull it, it repeats the same dumb phrase like &quot;I love you&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Balaam">Balaam</a>] 7-2-2008(28): A phrase used to insult horses - is<strong> pony</strong>. They hate that.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/WithLoveFromExIA">WithLoveFromExIA</a>] 20-6-2009(15): Lisa Simpson often utters the <em>phrase</em> &quot;Can I have a<strong> pony</strong>? Can I have a<strong> pony</strong>? Can I have a<strong> pony</strong>?&quot;. Finally Marge snaps &quot;No, not until you&#039;re older!&quot; &quot;But mum, it will be a <em>horse</em> by then.&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 17-3-2008(12): The<strong> Pony</strong> Express was a quick mail delivery service in old America. It actually used horses, not ponies, but the <em>phrase</em> &quot;Pony Express&quot; sounded better than &quot;Horse Express&quot;, and so they chose the better-sounding phrase as a marketing gimmick.
