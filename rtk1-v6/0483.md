heisig: "By <i>comparing</i> apes with anthropoids, we not only discover the latter have <b>descended</b> from those progenitors educated in the higher branches, but that the very idea of seeing everything <b>descended</b> from everything else, one way or another, means that there is &quot;nothing new UNDER the <i>sun</i>.&quot;"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 21-2-2007(241): Grandparent spends all DAY COMPARING photos of their<strong> DESCENDANTS</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois">Francois</a>] 10-3-2008(114): Japanese people have compared themselves as being<strong> descendants</strong> of the sun. (Amaterasu, the sun godesss). Sun, comparing =<strong> descendants</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 16-1-2008(48): Ask a Japanese person what this kanji means, and they will surely spout 昆布 (konbu, seaweed)　and 昆虫 (konchu, insect) - but beyond that they will likely be mystified. Here&#039;s my best crack at it: imagine a grandfather watching his DESCENDENTS (grandkids) playing outside under the <em>sun</em>, silently <em>comparing</em> them, considering which of them will grow up and make him proud. Suddenly, grandma calls them in for a snack of 昆布 and for a re-application of repellent to keep the 昆虫 away.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 30-8-2007(46): My official rebuttal to racism: We&#039;re all<strong> descendants</strong> of the <em>sun</em> - there&#039;s no reason to <em>compare</em> us.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic">anthropic</a>] 25-6-2008(32): We&#039;re all <strong>descendants</strong> of chimps, get over it, don&#039;t spend all <a href="../v4/12.html">day</a> (#12 日) trying to <a href="../v4/447.html">compare</a> (#447 比) various religious fairytales.
