heisig: "Sickness . . . third class."
primit: "sickness The enclosure shown in this FRAME is composed of a cave with ice outside of it. It is used for a number of kanji related to sickness. If you want to picture a caveman nursing a hangover with an ice-pack, that should provide enough help to remember the shape of this element and its meaning. [5]"

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 5-2-2007(59): If you hang around a <em>third class</em> hospital, you&#039;ll get<strong> ill</strong> with the <em>sickness</em> everyone else has.

She&#039;ll say stuff like &#039;&#039;That train ride made me<strong> ill</strong>. Seriously,&#039;&#039; and &#039;&#039;Oh my god, sitting next that dirty guy made me<strong> ill</strong>. Seriously.&#039;&#039; Sometimes I just want to kick her in the cunt.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 28-2-2007(22): Hint: The<strong> ill</strong> in<strong> ill</strong> almost looks like the roman numeral <strong>III</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 26-1-2010(12): Sickness primitive: <strong>Geico caveman</strong>. The <em>caveman</em> is flying <em>third class</em> to escape all the commercials when suddenly a voiceover says &quot;Flying with Southwest, so easy a caveman could do it.&quot; The caveman is offended and gets<strong> ill</strong>, throwing up all over the nearby passengers. <em>Hint:</em><strong> ill</strong> looks like III. Third class.
