1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 11-10-2007(167): During a traffic jam it is impossible to get your car to <em>enter</em> the <em>roadway</em> as it is<strong> crowded</strong> with cars. Think of a grid lock so bad cars are litterally scraping up against each other like people on a Japanese train during rush hour.

The trick is that a huge <strong>crowd</strong> suddenly <em>enters</em> the <em>road</em> and stampedes towards the person. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb7zwr3vQKo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb7zwr3vQKo</a> (thanks, decals).
