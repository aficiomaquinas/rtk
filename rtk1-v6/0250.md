heisig: "Here we have a pictograph of the back of a turtle, the two sloping vertical strokes representing the central ridge and the four short strokes the pattern. Think of reading turtle shells as a way to foretell the future, and in particular things that <b>portend</b> coming evils."
primit: "When this character is used as a primitive in its full form, we keep the key-word sense of a portent. When it appears to the left in its abbreviated form (namely, the left half only, 7), we shall give it the pictographic sense of a turtle."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977">mameha1977</a>] 17-9-2007(146): When your wife&#039;s <em>LEGs</em> get huge hairs on them it is surely a bad<strong> portent</strong> for things to come.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg">johanvg</a>] 13-7-2006(110): A bad<strong> portent</strong> makes the hairs on your legs stand.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 18-12-2007(35): Two persons turning <em>their backs</em> is a bad <strong>sign</strong>. Hint: Don&#039;t use &quot;turtle&quot; as a primitive. You&#039;ll save a lot of troubles with following kanji if you give this primitive the meaning &quot;a person&#039;s back&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 27-4-2009(26): The actual derivation of this Kanji is a pictograph of the cracks on a heated <em>turtle</em> shell which was used in divination. The way the cracks occur on this <em>turtle</em> are a<strong> portent</strong> of evil bad luck.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo">NooNoo</a>] 23-4-2008(9): To me it looks like a &quot;black angel&quot; or something (four wings and its human-looking legs). Maybe seeing it is a bad<strong> portent</strong>?

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/farpung">farpung</a>] 18-11-2011(5): When the hair on both sides of your butt crack (at top of legs) stands out, its a<strong> portent</strong> that something unusual is about to happen. Think of this as a hairy ass. Then the <a href="../v4/236">peach tree</a> (#236 桃) has fruit that looks like a hairy ass. People&#039;s eye&#039;s naturally <a href="../v4/237">stare</a> (#237 眺) at a hairy ass. The <a href="../v4/239">status quo</a> (#239 状) is half-assed. It has the &quot;appearance&quot; of a half-(hairy) assed dog.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/JetSetArnett">JetSetArnett</a>] 11-3-2008(5): As a primitive, I&#039;ve given this character the meaning of Bowser or King Koopa for the full form and Ninja Turtle for the half form. Some don&#039;t like this kanji to carry a turtle meaning, but I find it provides a very vivid, concrete image especially for any children of the 80s.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 14-11-2008(4): When the hairs on your legs are sticking out its a bad<strong> portent</strong>/omen... you better watch your back.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 28-9-2008(4): In Michael Ende&#039;s book &quot;Momo&quot;, the <em>turtle</em> named Cassiopeia can look half an hour into the future. Thus the words that appear on her <em>shell</em> are a<strong> portent</strong> of the evil things that the Men in Grey are plotting.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop">richcoop</a>] 13-7-2009(3): A<strong> portent</strong> of the U.S. debt in the TRILLIONS makes my leg hairs stick out.
