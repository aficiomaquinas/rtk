heisig: "We first referred to this character back in frame 185, to which you might want to return to have a peek. The image of <b>logic</b> we are given is something like a central <i>jewel</i> in a <i>computer</i>, like the <i>jewels</i> in old clocks that keep them running smoothly. Try to picture yourself making your way through all the rams and roms and approaching this shining <i>jewel</i>, a chorus of voice sand a blast of trumpets in the background heralding the great seat of all-knowing <b>logic</b>."
