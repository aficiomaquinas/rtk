1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rakushun">Rakushun</a>] 4-9-2007(236): In ancient Greece, it was the religion of the time to<strong> adore</strong> the gods who live on Mount Olympus.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shizuru">Shizuru</a>] 21-8-2007(143): I would<strong> adore</strong> the religious people if they just went and threw themselves off a mountain top.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hawkeye123">Hawkeye123</a>] 6-2-2009(99): Several kanji become their &#039;greater&#039; version when you add 山 on top ( 風 becomes 嵐 , 石 becomes 岩 ). Thus, <em>religion</em> becomes <strong>adoration</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/desmidus">desmidus</a>] 16-2-2008(82): The annoying woman from Los Angeles says &quot;oh I absolutely<strong> adore</strong> those cute little mountain religions, like tibetan buddhism, they shave their cute little heads and wear those bright pretty robes, so adorable.&quot;.
