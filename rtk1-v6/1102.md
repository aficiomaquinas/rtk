1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 31-12-2009(183): Ph.D graduation for assembly line of doctors(<em>needles</em>) with the cap and tassel(<em>top hat</em>). It took them <em>10 years</em> (Bachelor&#039;s, Masters, PhD) to get there.... :-p.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fagie37">fagie37</a>] 2-4-2008(95): When you<strong> graduate</strong>, you wear a hat and<strong> graduate</strong> in an assembly line while your parents sit on pins and needles because it will take ten years to pay off those loans.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xxinde">xxinde</a>] 12-1-2010(69): In the distant future, universities will produce<strong> graduate</strong>s on <em>assembly lines</em>. As the kids move along on a conveyor belt they are injected with knowledge via a <em>needle</em> from below while overhead robotic arms place <em>square caps with tassels</em> on their heads. This way it only takes a few minutes to<strong> graduate</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-9-2008(37): The <em>couple</em> counted to <em>ten</em> before tossing their <em>top hats</em> at <strong>graduation</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eightyd">eightyd</a>] 13-6-2010(17): Forget the heisig stuff for this one. To me it looks like a little stick figure in a graduation cap with happy eyes. Hes happy, I mean he is graduating after all.
