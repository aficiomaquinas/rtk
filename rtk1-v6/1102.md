1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 31-12-2009(183): Ph.D graduation for assembly line of doctors(<em>needles</em>) with the cap and tassel(<em>top hat</em>). It took them <em>10 years</em> (Bachelor&#039;s, Masters, PhD) to get there.... :-p.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fagie37">fagie37</a>] 2-4-2008(95): When you<strong> graduate</strong>, you wear a hat and<strong> graduate</strong> in an assembly line while your parents sit on pins and needles because it will take ten years to pay off those loans.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xxinde">xxinde</a>] 12-1-2010(69): In the distant future, universities will produce<strong> graduate</strong>s on <em>assembly lines</em>. As the kids move along on a conveyor belt they are injected with knowledge via a <em>needle</em> from below while overhead robotic arms place <em>square caps with tassels</em> on their heads. This way it only takes a few minutes to<strong> graduate</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-9-2008(37): The <em>couple</em> counted to <em>ten</em> before tossing their <em>top hats</em> at <strong>graduation</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eightyd">eightyd</a>] 13-6-2010(17): Forget the heisig stuff for this one. To me it looks like a little stick figure in a graduation cap with happy eyes. Hes happy, I mean he is graduating after all.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip">Ramchip</a>] 15-3-2008(15): There are a lot of<strong> graduate</strong>s this year... we&#039;re going to need a lot of <em>hats</em>. There&#039;s a whole <em>assembly line</em> of <em>needle</em>workers making them!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/plumage">plumage</a>] 23-12-2008(9): When they<strong> GRADUATE</strong>, students throw their TOP HATS in the air, full of hope, but soon many will work on ASSEMBLY LINES anyway. Some will get hooked on NEEDLES.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Biene">Biene</a>] 28-4-2008(8): The Ph.D students of medicine (<em>needle</em>) that <strong>graduate</strong> this year receive a very unformal graduation by beeing put on an <em>assembly line</em> which rolls past the audience and the <em>hats</em> are just dumped on their heads. There is not even time for a handshake... and that&#039;s all they recieve after <em>10</em> years of hard study! (thanks chamcham).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Drack">Drack</a>] 6-1-2011(4): I always saw this as a pictograph. The<strong> graduate</strong>s have the graduation caps on, the ^_^ faces, and are sticking their tongues out at the too-serious staff members giving speeches.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 11-8-2010(3): It&#039;s interesting to note that this kanji can be obtained by subtracting lines from <a href="../v4/1024">squat/sit</a> (#1024 座). After you are done Unlike <a href="../v4/1024">squat/sit</a> (#1024 座), there are no lines between the two 人 s, because once you<strong> graduate</strong> there is no more <em>sitting</em> in the school <em>grounds</em> on your a%%. You need to put on your mortarboard (the <em>top hat</em>), and start working on an <em>assembly line</em> with the <em>needle</em>.
