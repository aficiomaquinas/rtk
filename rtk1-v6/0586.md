heisig: "This pictograph shows the animal <i>horns</i> at the top attached to the head (3rd stroke), the front and back legs (strokes 4 and 5) and body (final stroke)."
commen: "* The primitive meaning of <i>sheep</i> can add the further connotations given in the following frame. As we saw with the <i>cow</i>, the &quot;tail&quot; is cut off when it is set immediately over another element: ⺷. Note the change in stroke order, as exemplified in the following frame."
