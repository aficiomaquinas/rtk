1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 8-11-2007(200): After a day being <em>virtuouos</em> and keeping the city safe, <em>Spiderman</em>&#039;s outfit is in need of some repair. Luckily, as he can shoot out threads<strong> darning</strong> is very easy for him to do.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rakushun">Rakushun</a>] 7-7-2007(60): <strong>Darning</strong> is too obscure a word for me, I prefer to just think of it as repair. And obviously, repairing someones broken cloth things is a virtuous thing to do, and you need thread to do it.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cheechuan">cheechuan</a>] 19-3-2008(49): <em>Spiderman</em> is of course <em>virtuous</em> and spends a lot of time<strong> darning</strong> his costume after battles so that his privates don&#039;t show.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akimoto">akimoto</a>] 1-3-2007(24): <strong>Darning</strong> socks instead of buying new ones shows the virtousness of the person - it exhibits the Japanese virtue of thrift (the Meiji emperor would refuse to buy new boots, constantly having them repaired. The Showa emperor would refuse to buy books he wanted because he &quot;couldn&#039;t afford them.&quot;).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 13-9-2007(19): The <em>thread</em> is too <em>virtuous</em> for damning; it can only be used for<strong> darning</strong>.
