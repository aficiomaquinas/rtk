1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 8-1-2006(166): Cars are rough steel things, lacking<strong> soft</strong>ness.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 18-12-2007(115): If your <em>car</em> has really<strong> soft</strong> seats, you may start <em>yawning</em> and eventually fall asleep at the wheel (imagine that this seat is a huge<strong> soft</strong> beanbag that nearly swallows the driver, and it will be easier to remember).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 4-10-2008(40): Someday, they will invent<strong> SOFT</strong> <strong>cars</strong>. The <strong>cars</strong> will be so safe that accidents will become no big deal. (Imagine drivers <strong>yawning</strong> as their cars crash into each other and bounce harmlessly away).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/plumage">plumage</a>] 11-10-2008(20): If you play<strong> SOFT</strong> rock in the CAR while driving, you&#039;ll soon start YAWNING.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 28-12-2007(10): A<strong> soft</strong>ener commercial, but with anthropomorphized <em>cars</em> (similar to Pixar&#039;s Cars for example). The little baby <em>car</em> is wrapped in some kind of<strong> soft</strong> fabric and <em>yawning</em>. So cute!
