heisig: "If you <i>double back</i> (fold over) most animals - or people, for that matter - in the middle, the <i>part of the body</i> where the crease comes is the <b>abdomen</b>."
primit: "double back(odwracac zawracac) Either the connotations of turning around and heading back during one’s travels, or folding an object in half will do here. It pictures someone doubling back to the nearest inn to lie down and rest a weary pair of walking legs after a full day’s voyage. [9]"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KANJI">KANJI</a>] 28-11-2006(127): The only <strong>body</strong> part that <strong>doubles over</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 30-8-2007(66): Imagine getting punched in the<strong> abdomen</strong>, a fairly tender part of <em>flesh</em>, and instead of doubling forward, you <em>double back</em>. That would be pretty painful.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elanlan">elanlan</a>] 17-6-2009(40): The <em>part of the body (flesh)</em> that is exercised when we lie down and bring our <em>walking legs</em> toward the <em>sun</em> is the<strong> abdomen</strong> (aka: leglifts).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip">Ramchip</a>] 23-2-2007(19): Try not to confuse the primitive &#039;double back&#039; and <a href="../v4/1130">fold</a> (#1130 折). After I <em>backtracked</em> from a long day of hiking, my <strong>abdomen</strong> was hungry for <em>flesh</em>, so I ate a huge steak.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiisu">kiisu</a>] 3-3-2008(13): Well, flesh doubled over..and over .. think of the guts ...in the<strong> abdomen</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ericshun">ericshun</a>] 20-2-2007(13): Situps.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shadolite">shadolite</a>] 20-3-2008(12): The part of the body that hurts so bad during the menstrual cycle is usually the<strong> abdomen</strong>. In some cases, the pain can be so bad that one doubles over in agony.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fjolnir">fjolnir</a>] 10-1-2010(8): If your <em>body</em> had a <em>double back</em> there would be no<strong> abdomen</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcmike2099">mcmike2099</a>] 15-6-2009(7): The<strong> abdomen</strong> is one of the most difficult <strong>BODY</strong> parts to work out. To improve your abs you have to do a lot of crunches. Each time, just as you reach the bottom, you have to <strong>DOUBLE BACK</strong> and use your<strong> abdomen</strong> to push yourself up again. (Remember, to <em>double back</em> is to <strong>lie down</strong> after a long <strong>day</strong> on your <strong>walking legs</strong>).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jbudding">jbudding</a>] 27-10-2012(6): After starting my walk, a growling in my<strong> ABDOMEN</strong> made me <em>double back</em>, for food to feed my <em>flesh</em>.
