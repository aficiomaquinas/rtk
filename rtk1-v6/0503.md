primit: "double back(odwracac zawracac) Either the connotations of turning around and heading back during one’s travels, or folding an object in half will do here. It pictures someone doubling back to the nearest inn to lie down and rest a weary pair of walking legs after a full day’s voyage. [9]"
heisig: "If you <i>double back</i> (fold over) most animals - or people, for that matter - in the middle, the <i>part of the body</i> where the crease comes is the <b>abdomen</b>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KANJI">KANJI</a>] 28-11-2006(127): The only <strong>body</strong> part that <strong>doubles over</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 30-8-2007(66): Imagine getting punched in the<strong> abdomen</strong>, a fairly tender part of <em>flesh</em>, and instead of doubling forward, you <em>double back</em>. That would be pretty painful.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elanlan">elanlan</a>] 17-6-2009(40): The <em>part of the body (flesh)</em> that is exercised when we lie down and bring our <em>walking legs</em> toward the <em>sun</em> is the<strong> abdomen</strong> (aka: leglifts).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip">Ramchip</a>] 23-2-2007(19): Try not to confuse the primitive &#039;double back&#039; and <a href="../v4/1130.html">fold</a> (#1130 折). After I <em>backtracked</em> from a long day of hiking, my <strong>abdomen</strong> was hungry for <em>flesh</em>, so I ate a huge steak.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiisu">kiisu</a>] 3-3-2008(13): Well, flesh doubled over..and over .. think of the guts ...in the<strong> abdomen</strong>.
