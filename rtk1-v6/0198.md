heisig: "The notion of <b>guarding</b> something easily brings to mind the image of someone standing <b>guard</b>, like the royal soldiers in front of Buckingham Palace or the Pope's Swiss <b>Guard</b>. The whole idea of hiring <b>guards</b> is that they should stick like <i>glue</i> to your <i>house</i> to protect it from unwanted prowlers. So go ahead and <i>glue</i> a <b>guard</b> to your <i>house</i> in imagination."
