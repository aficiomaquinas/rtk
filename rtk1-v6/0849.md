1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 22-2-2007(327): The<strong> venerable old man</strong> is the <em>public</em> figure head of the Native American Village, answering all questions and solving all problems. The higher in rank you get in this tribe, the more <em>feathers</em> decorate you. Imagine this old man covered in beautiful feathers.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 27-5-2008(96): The<strong> venerable old man</strong> is using the <em>public restroom</em> in the park where he feeds the pigeons. But, alas, there is no toilet paper! So, he&#039;s caught a pigeon and is using it to wipe his bottom. (note the feathers on the bottom of the kanji, this helps remember placement). Can you see the <em>feathers</em> flying everywhere?

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rich_f">rich_f</a>] 18-7-2007(14): Whenever I see <em>feathers</em>, I think of <em>Haibane.</em> The <strong>venerable old man</strong> is the <em>public</em> communicator to the <em>Haibane</em>. (Works if you watched <em>Haibane Renmei</em>, I guess.).
