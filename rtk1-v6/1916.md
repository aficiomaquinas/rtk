1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/felicitygreen">felicitygreen</a>] 27-4-2006(206): The EU and US impose such high<strong> tariff</strong>s on food imports that third world <em>wheat</em> (the most basic of staples) never reaches first world supermarket <em>shelves</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 6-8-2006(134): According to Henshall, this kanji originally represented the harvested rice (the wheat primitive) that farmers paid as a tithe. Its meaning today would seem to be very similar. Imagine the farmer putting aside some of his harvested <em>wheat</em> on a <em>shelf</em> in order to pay the<strong> tariff</strong> to his lord.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 11-3-2007(29): All the <em>wheat</em> imports sit on a <em>shelf</em> until the <strong>tariff</strong> is paid and it can be distributed.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 2-3-2008(24): Tax. (Heisig is trying to hard to come up with different words) The devil who has collected wheat taxes before, stores these taxes in shelves.
