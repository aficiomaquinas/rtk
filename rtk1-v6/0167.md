heisig: "Now I am going to do something unusual. The character in this frame is going to get one meaning and the primitive another, with no relation at all between the two. In time, I hope you will see how helpful this is. The kanji key word, <b>square jewel</b>, depicts a mammoth precious stone, several feet high, made by piling up large heaps of <i>soil</i> on top of one another. Not something you would want to present your betrothed on your wedding day, but a good image for remembering this rare character, used chiefly in personal names nowadays."
commen: "* As a primitive, we shall use this character to mean <i>ivy</i>, that creepy vegetation that covers the surface of the <i>ground</i> to form a sort of &quot;second&quot; <i>ground</i> that can get somewhat tricky to walk on without tripping."
