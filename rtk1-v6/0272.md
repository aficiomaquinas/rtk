commen: "* As a primitive, we can use this to mean either <i>jewel</i> or <i>ball</i>. When it appears anywhere other than on the left side of a kanji, it takes the same shape as here. On the left, it will be lacking the final stroke, making it the same as the character in the previous frame."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip">Ramchip</a>] 24-4-2007(200): The king is said to have only one family<strong> jewel</strong> below the belt...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 20-1-2008(36): The king is said to have only one family<strong> jewel</strong> below the belt...and he hangs left! (I always screw up the direction of the &quot;drop&quot;).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indiana23">indiana23</a>] 28-12-2009(35): I can tell you that there is only one thing that Japanese people think when they see this Kanji, and that&#039;s BALLS(no joke). Kintama, or gold balls, means testicles. Funny story, we met a European girl not to long ago who had this as a tattoo, and she thought it actually meant<strong> JEWEL</strong>. But as I said, the Japanese guys wanted to know why she liked BALLS so much. lol (True Story).
