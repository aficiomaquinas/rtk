1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 11-9-2007(149): You outsiders better learn your<strong> place</strong>! An <em>axe</em> stuck in the <em>door</em> when you get home is a pretty good indicator that this might not be the best<strong> place</strong> for you.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 23-7-2007(94): A <strong>place</strong> for everything and everything in its <strong>place</strong>. To the right of the <em>door</em> is the standard <strong>place</strong> for the <em>axe</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 5-10-2008(57): When you come over to my<strong> place</strong>, you leave your <em>axe</em> at the <em>door</em>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/HerrPetersen">HerrPetersen</a>] 9-5-2007(41): Platz - The &quot;Shining&quot; (Jack Nicholson hacks the <em>door</em> with an <em>ax</em>) is not a nice<strong> place</strong> to be.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saxman_52">saxman_52</a>] 10-6-2009(23): Heeeeeeere&#039;s Johnny! Jack Nicholson breaks down a <em>door</em> with his <em>ax</em> in order to get to his wife&#039;s hiding<strong> place</strong>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jordwest">jordwest</a>] 29-9-2008(19): Notice the letters P and T: [P -&gt;<strong> Place</strong>] [T -&gt; Tokoro (The reading for this kanji)].

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-1-2006(14): Using the expression &quot;to crash at someone&#039;s<strong> place</strong>&quot; quite literally, here we have <em>Axe-man</em> crashing into his<strong> place</strong>, smashing the <em>door</em> to bits with his <em>axe</em>. This plot may remind you of the Horror / Thriller movie &quot;The Shining&quot; with actor Jack Nicholson.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zamatt">zamatt</a>] 22-9-2010(5): Think of the movie &quot;The Shining&quot; as Jack uses the <em>axe</em> on the <em>door</em>, Wendy was in a very bad<strong> place</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ellasevia">ellasevia</a>] 24-3-2010(5): I will always remember the<strong> place</strong> where the crazy man tried to kill me, because his <em>ax</em> is still lodged in the <em>door</em>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matsuyamakiwi">matsuyamakiwi</a>] 2-6-2008(5): Conveniently, when Jack Nicholson in &quot;The shining&quot; hacks the <em>door</em> with the <em>axe</em>, it&#039;s on the right side of the door that he does it (check it out). However, for the girl it doesn&#039;t matter where the <em>axe</em> lands - it&#039;s just not a nice <strong>place</strong> to be.
