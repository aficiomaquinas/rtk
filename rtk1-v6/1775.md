1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 28-5-2007(238): [defense; protection] For &quot;<em>defense</em> against the dark arts&quot; class, you go the magical <em>boulevard</em> and buy an enchanted <em>locket</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 1-5-2008(95): Since it was in the middle of the <em>boulevard</em>, everyone could see she hit the man only in self-<strong>defense</strong>, as he was trying to steal her valuable <em>locket</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AryllWind">AryllWind</a>] 5-4-2008(66): I think of<strong> defense</strong> as an attribute in video games. Like Final Fantasy, for example. When you go to a new town, you walk up and down the <em>boulevard</em> for shops that will sell you better items. One of the best accessory items for<strong> defense</strong> is a <em>locket</em> that absorbs magical energy. Unfortunately, you can&#039;t buy it yet, as it costs over a hundred thousand gil.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 5-6-2009(24): <em>Boulevard Locket</em>.<strong> Defense</strong> +2 when equipped.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 26-2-2007(11): &quot;It&#039;s cheap <strong>defense</strong>. On this <em>boulevard</em> the mafia rules. Your only <strong>defense</strong> is the <em>locket</em> (with the picture of the Don in it) which we will rent for a &#039;modest fee&#039; to anybody who&#039;d like to keep living. You want some <strong>defense</strong>?&quot; Tony said with a smile.
