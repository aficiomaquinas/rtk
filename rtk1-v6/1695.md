The god was infuriated and yelled at him &quot;HOW DARE YOU TORTURE MY CORN IN SUCH WAYS!&quot;. The End.

Story: Decorating a <em>bonsai tree</em> for Christmas <em>does not equal</em> an <strong>observance</strong> of the real meaning of Christmas.

(For the record, I completely made that up, and I don&#039;t think corn has anything to do with Ainu, except that it reminds me of natives).
