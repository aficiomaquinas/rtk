2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Senshi">Senshi</a>] 20-7-2007(54): The<strong> spine</strong> goes from one opening mouth/opening (mouth/face) to another mouth/opening (genitals). Just think of these openings being enlarged to represent the head and the body. The bottom is bigger because the body is bigger than the face.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MichaelAnd">MichaelAnd</a>] 10-3-2008(37): The<strong> spine</strong> goes from one opening mouth/opening (mouth/face) to another mouth/opening (in your ass).
