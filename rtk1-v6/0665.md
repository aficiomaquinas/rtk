1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 29-6-2006(224): <strong>Busy</strong> (as in &quot;occupied&quot;) means a <em>state of mind</em> where all other thoughts are <em>perished</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 28-5-2010(104): ^^^Make the &quot;state of mind&quot; primitive <em>Data (from Star Trek)</em> instead right now and save yourself the headache; &#039;state of mind&#039; is too vague! (<em>Data</em> can stay so <strong>busy</strong> as not to sleep without <em>dying</em>. He&#039;s a robot).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jackhuddleston">jackhuddleston</a>] 2-5-2008(71): Some people who are workaholics say, &quot;I can rest when I&#039;m dead.&quot; That is the sort of state of mind a<strong> busy</strong> person has!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 17-2-2008(41): Poor Japanese people are so<strong> busy</strong>. They work like 80 hour weeks! Slowly, you see them turn into automatons...their bodies still alive, but their <em>state of mind</em> like they&#039;ve long ago <em>perished</em>... (Mental image: most stressed out salaryman you know.).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 1-6-2007(24): As others have suggested, I personified &quot;state of mind&quot; as the android, Data from here on. He is constanly analysing humans and emotions, plus he has an overactive mind for good measure. --- <em>Data&#039;s</em> is<strong> busy</strong> trying to understand why do humans <em>perish</em> (die). --- (If it helps bring Data to mind, think of &quot;<em>Data</em>-base is<strong> busy</strong>, please try again later&quot;).
