1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 29-6-2006(224): <strong>Busy</strong> (as in &quot;occupied&quot;) means a <em>state of mind</em> where all other thoughts are <em>perished</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 28-5-2010(104): ^^^Make the &quot;state of mind&quot; primitive <em>Data (from Star Trek)</em> instead right now and save yourself the headache; &#039;state of mind&#039; is too vague! (<em>Data</em> can stay so <strong>busy</strong> as not to sleep without <em>dying</em>. He&#039;s a robot).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jackhuddleston">jackhuddleston</a>] 2-5-2008(71): Some people who are workaholics say, &quot;I can rest when I&#039;m dead.&quot; That is the sort of state of mind a<strong> busy</strong> person has!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 17-2-2008(41): Poor Japanese people are so<strong> busy</strong>. They work like 80 hour weeks! Slowly, you see them turn into automatons...their bodies still alive, but their <em>state of mind</em> like they&#039;ve long ago <em>perished</em>... (Mental image: most stressed out salaryman you know.).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 1-6-2007(24): As others have suggested, I personified &quot;state of mind&quot; as the android, Data from here on. He is constanly analysing humans and emotions, plus he has an overactive mind for good measure. --- <em>Data&#039;s</em> is<strong> busy</strong> trying to understand why do humans <em>perish</em> (die). --- (If it helps bring Data to mind, think of &quot;<em>Data</em>-base is<strong> busy</strong>, please try again later&quot;).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tsenita">tsenita</a>] 25-7-2009(12): Star Trek Story: the Enterprise has flown too far out into space and run out of fuel, so they are stuck there for 100 years and all the human crew finally <em>perishes</em>... <em>Data</em> now is the only one on the ship, and he&#039;ll now be very <strong>busy</strong> trying to do the work of an entire starship&#039;s crew trying to get the ship moving again somehow.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 27-5-2009(6): If you constantly have a<strong> busy</strong> <em>state of mind</em>, you will <em>perish</em> young.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danno">Danno</a>] 16-2-2009(6): Death by overwork, has a special word for it in Japan Karoshi. If you are in a <em>state of mind</em> that you must be<strong> busy</strong> all the time, just to keep up appeareances and please your whipsnapping employers, you too, could well <em>persih</em> from the karoshi <em>state of mind</em> too.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/killtheclock">killtheclock</a>] 6-2-2009(6): Immer <strong>beschäftigt</strong>. Man merkt gar nicht wie man in einen <em>Gemütszustand</em> gleitet in dem man <em>zugrunde geht</em>. Burn-out!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy">howdycowdy</a>] 25-3-2008(6): The <em>Dali Lama</em> (my image for <em>state of mind</em>) is<strong> BUSY</strong> trying to prevent the Tibetan people from <em>perishing</em>.
