1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 29-10-2006(245): A<strong> depression</strong> is a hole in the ground. Water naturally collects there which provides moisture for vines to grow.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stefanot">stefanot</a>] 30-3-2007(113): The<strong> depression</strong> in the ground become a trap: the <em>hole</em> was filled with <em>water</em> and covered with <em>ivy</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 29-8-2006(35): The meaning of this character is an indentation in the ground, not emotional<strong> depression</strong>. It&#039;s best to avoid using the latter in your story because it will give you the wrong meaning (keep in mind the eventual goal is to read kanji and understand the actual meaning of them). This particular<strong> depression</strong> is a <em>hole</em> in the ground that collects water, and ivy is growing out of it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 24-6-2009(16): (<strong>WARNING</strong>: Sexual content) Being the dirty girl that she is, I came upon <em>Paris Hilton</em> having sex in a<strong> depression</strong>, or <em>hole</em>, in the ground. At this point, however, she and her unfortunately partner were tangled up in some <em>ivy</em> and couldn&#039;t get out. So I filled it with <em>water</em> and watched them both drown.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/coinbaahd">coinbaahd</a>] 20-11-2011(7): This kanji reminds me of video games. There&#039;s a big <em>sink hole</em> in the ground that is now filled with <em>water</em> that you can swim in and <em>vines</em> growing all around that you can climb on.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xingji">xingji</a>] 5-10-2009(7): According to my dictionary a<strong> DEPRESSION</strong> is an area that is sunk below its surronding - a hollow...i&#039;m surprised no one saw this before but remembering the elements for HORIZON - a<strong> depression</strong> is a HOLE in the HORIZON -(the cliff has fallen into a hole).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/slydog1">slydog1</a>] 28-1-2013(4): Tarzan is walking in the jungle when he falls into a large<strong> DEPRESSION</strong>; the HOLE starts filling with WATER, it looks like he is trapped, but then he spots some IVY on the walls to help him escape.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 3-2-2008(4): (stefanot)the<strong> depression</strong> in the ground becomes a trap: the <em>hole</em> was filled with <em>water</em> and covered with <em>ivy</em>. See how Elektra falls into the trap.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 27-2-2008(3): My friend is kinda stupid, but has a theory how the great<strong> depression</strong> started. He says a big black hole opened up above America and brita pitchers started to rain out of it and greak all over the ground. Then the black hole made ivy grow all over the highways and roads. With all this nobody could transport stuff and it caused a<strong> depression</strong>. Yeah he&#039;s dumb.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Fadeway">Fadeway</a>] 19-2-2012(2): There&#039;s only one, nay, two reasons for there to be a<strong> depression</strong> into the ground - someone dug a <em>hole</em> to find either <em>water</em> or <em>squared jewels</em>.
