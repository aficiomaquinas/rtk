primit: "shelf The pictographic representation in the primitive shown here is a small stand with horizontal shelves. Thus we give it the general meaning of a shelf. It differs from the kanji and primitive for an eye only in its final stroke, which extends beyond the two vertical strokes at both ends. Think of it as a shelf for special keepsakes or a glass bureau for knickknacks, keeping it distinct from the kanji we learned in FRAME 202 棚. [5]"
heisig: "Thread . . . shelf."
