2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/redskatz">redskatz</a>] 9-4-2009(113): Having a good <strong>attitude</strong> means believing in your <em>heart</em> that you have the <em>ability</em> to do anything - like memorizing more than 2000 kanji, for example.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 16-10-2006(13): If you had the <em>ability</em> to read people&#039;s <em>hearts</em> (especially women&#039;s hearts), it&#039;d be so easy to find out why they have such an<strong> attitude</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 1-4-2008(8): Hint: Carebears (trading fire for heart-power).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 28-1-2008(3): It takes great ability to change the<strong> attitude</strong> of your heart, say, in become a more positive person.

At first, because he had no <em>ability</em> in kung fu, everyone had an<strong> attitude</strong> towards him. But after he started believing in himself, Shifu had a change of <em>heart</em> and his<strong> attitude</strong> towards Po changed. Also, Po eventually develops the right<strong> attitude</strong> and chooses to fight Tai Lung. His <em>ability</em> to trust in his own and his master&#039;s <em>heart</em> is what developed this positive<strong> attitude</strong>.
