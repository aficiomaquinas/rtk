1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 15-8-2007(322): When a man<strong> PROPOSE</strong>S to a lady, he takes her FINGER and places the ring on it JUST SO, and the moment sweeps her away.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 23-4-2008(87): I tried to<strong> propose</strong> to my girlfriend, but the ring was too small to fit her <em>finger</em>. Instead of saying yes, she just uttered an annoyed sigh. So I rushed to the jeweler where he made it bigger. But now it was too big, so I rushed back to make it smaller. This spiel kept going on until the ring was finally <em>just so</em>. Her eyes lit up and she said yes.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 15-2-2007(38): When you<strong> propose</strong>, the ring you place on your fiance&#039;s <em>finger</em> better be <em>just so</em> (style/size/placement/etc.) or she&#039;ll reject your sorry ass.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zoletype">zoletype</a>] 3-8-2009(33): Business proposals in Japan have to be set out just so. If you fail to lay them out in the correct way, you have to give up a finger, just like the yakuza. <em>NOTE</em> This is not the same type of<strong> propose</strong> as to<strong> propose</strong> for marriage, so I opted for a different direction.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/.David">.David</a>] 23-5-2011(14): You raise your <em>finger</em> at a meeting, to<strong> propose</strong> things to be done <em>just so</em>. <em>NOTE</em> This is not the same &quot;propose&quot; as to &quot;propose for marriage&quot;.
