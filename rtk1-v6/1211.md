1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 14-1-2007(243): It&#039;s the latest Japanese game show: <strong>Forudo</strong>! Contestants are given a sheet of paper and are told to<strong> fold</strong> it into a complex origami shape. If they&#039;re not done in 60 seconds, a huge axe descends from the ceiling and chops their work in half. Contestants know to recoil their hands from the falling axe, but some have been so absorbed in<strong> fold</strong>ing, they ignore the buzzer and get their fingers chopped off.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Piitaa">Piitaa</a>] 22-6-2006(89): <strong>Fold</strong> some origami into the shape of an axe with your fingers. It&#039;s even as sharp, so watch out for paper cuts!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jotun">jotun</a>] 24-5-2008(45): To hold an <em>axe</em>, you need to<strong> fold</strong> your <em>fingers</em> around the handle.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lanval">lanval</a>] 9-3-2009(9): I&#039; m so strong, I can<strong> fold</strong> the axe with my fingers (works well for me, just imagine it clearly).
