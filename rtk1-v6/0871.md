2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pauline">Pauline</a>] 18-6-2006(111): Throwing all those coins (see <a href="../v4/368">coin</a> (#368 銭)) was a really bad idea; people got mad with greed. The only<strong> remainder</strong>s left were the <em>bones</em> of those that was on the <em>float</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 13-9-2008(85): After the cannibal <em>float</em> had passed the crowd, all that <strong>remained</strong> were <em>bones</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 13-2-2008(30): At the halloween parade, there was a <em>float</em> made entirely from <em>bones</em>. Once the parade was over the<strong> remainder</strong> of the bones were left in the streets for the dogs to chew on.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 11-4-2010(23): Maths problem - it takes 6 <em>bones</em> to make a <em>float</em>. If I have 37 <em>bones</em> and make as many <em>floats</em> as possible, what&#039;s the<strong> remainder</strong>?
