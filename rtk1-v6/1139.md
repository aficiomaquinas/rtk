1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 2-10-2007(246): Fingers<strong> grip</strong>ping the roof as your about to fall to your death. Think of an action scene in some movie.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 23-8-2007(69): (This is the にぎ of sushi). A sushi chef <em>climaxes</em> into a rice ball, wraps it in an <em>American flag</em>, and <strong>grips</strong> is firm with his <em>fingers</em> to form the &quot;Fuck You America Onigiri.&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 7-8-2007(47): During a game of &#039;Capture the Flag&#039;: at the climax of the game the red team moves forward,<strong> grip</strong>ping the flag tighly in their fingers.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 3-12-2007(18): [Image: tires<strong> grip</strong>ping the road] I get this confused with <a href="../v4/1752.html">grasp</a> (#1752 把). To avoid confusion, I imagine a person sliding down a roof. They try to hold on but their <em>fingers</em> keep slipping because they have no <strong>grip</strong> (friction).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep">pazustep</a>] 31-7-2008(15): Remember the kinky couple from <a href="../v4/1058.html">roof</a> (#1058 屋)? They better have a good<strong> grip</strong> on their <em>fingers</em>, lest fall off the <em>roof</em>.
