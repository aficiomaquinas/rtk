heisig: "The key word of course calls to mind the feast of Christmas. As the famous poem at the start of St. John's gospel tells us, the <b>nativity</b> we celebrate at Christmas had its origins at the very start of time and governs all of human history: it represents the <i>prolongation</i> of the eternal <i>Word</i> in time and space."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 8-1-2008(207): <strong>Nativity</strong> = born, being born. Think of <strong>birth</strong> as a painful and <em>prolong</em>ed event. And of course, all the <em>words</em> and curses being yelled at the soon-to-be father for doing this to her!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63">ashman63</a>] 7-4-2008(105): The<strong> nativity</strong> story: A child born to a virgin mother? Sounds to me like the <em>words</em> have <em>stretch</em>ed what is sensibly <em>correct</em>. Sadly, those <em>words</em> have continued to be spread through the <em>prolonged</em> use of the bible.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei">javiergakusei</a>] 17-4-2007(61): At<strong> Nativity</strong> (christmas), the priest says more Words (sermon) than the rest of the time, Prolonging mass duration.
