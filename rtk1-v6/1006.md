1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 24-12-2006(243): Like in the biblical sense, someone looks skyward and makes a <em>request</em> for<strong> salvation</strong> from this horrible <em>taskmaster</em>...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johan">Johan</a>] 22-4-2006(131): For<strong> salvation</strong> you have to <em>request</em> forgiveness from God (the ultimate <em>taskmaster</em>).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 10-6-2007(31): A cruel <em>taskmaster</em> makes a <em>request</em> to god for<strong> salvation</strong> from the sins commited during his life. Yeaaaah... right.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 14-4-2008(16): [+rtk] Who would need to <em>request</em><strong> salvation</strong> more than <em>Hitler</em>? Hitler has joined the <em>Salvation</em> Army (in order to get some of his own). He hears that they need <em>rice</em>, and figures that the more <em>grains of rice</em> he gets, the more <em>salvation</em> he&#039;ll get. So he goes around town in his Santa suit <em>request</em>ing <em>grains of rice</em>. If someone doesn&#039;t pony up, he produces a small <em>arrowhead</em> (knives over 6cm are illegal in Japan) and snarls, &quot;that wasn&#039;t a <em>request</em>&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 11-11-2012(11): He <em>requested</em><strong> salvation</strong> from God, the <em>taskmaster</em> (compare with <a href="../v4/1744.html">pardon</a> (#1744 赦)).
