1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 22-11-2006(134): Pictograph. I think of that Harry Potter spell book that had to be bound shut coz it wanted to eat you.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 4-3-2008(63): 冊 さつ 1: counter for books A heavy scrapbook so full that flowers are sticking out. Only if a scrapbook is that full, it can be called a heavy book.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rabite">rabite</a>] 19-7-2008(58): Pictograph of three books tied up for transport.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 10-1-2010(34): A pictograph of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy viewed end on: All <em>3</em><strong> tome</strong>s held together with <em>one ribbon</em> - &quot;one ribbon to bind them all&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 8-10-2006(14): Hint:<strong> Tome</strong> rhymes with &quot;comb&quot;, and it looks a little bit similar to the comb primitive.
