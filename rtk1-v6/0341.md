heisig: "The shape of this kanji, slightly differing from that for <i>soil</i> by virtue of its shorter final stroke, hints at a broad-shouldered, slender-waisted warrior standing at attention. When feudalism collapsed, these warriors became Japan's <b>gentlemen</b>."
commen: "* The primitive meaning reverts to the more colorful image of the <i>samurai</i>, Japan's warrior class."
