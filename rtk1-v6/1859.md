1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zareon">Zareon</a>] 3-4-2007(196): The king has a really<strong> rare</strong> umbrella, it can change shape.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-2-2008(60): Tip: <em>umbrella</em> + <em>shape</em> : This combination of primitives appears four times in Heisig, so it may be worthwhile giving it a name. I suggest &quot;<em>parasol</em>&quot; (because it is the same <em>shape</em> as an <em>umbrella</em>). REF: <em>rare</em> (FRAME 1723) , <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1724">check-up</a> (#1724 診), <a href="../v4/2574.html">measles</a> (#2574 疹), <a href="../v4/2720.html">fallible</a> (#2720 謬).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samesong">samesong</a>] 13-10-2008(29): <em>Mystique</em> stole the<strong> rare</strong> <em>jewel</em>-encrusted <em>umbrella</em> by simply morphing into a <em>king</em>, marching into the palace and taking it. &quot;I&#039;ll be back, I&#039;d like to take a quick stroll in the rain!&#039; S/he said, and casually strolled off holding the umbrella (pictograph - you can see the umbrella over Mystique).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 15-6-2009(26): It&#039;s<strong> rare</strong> to see the <em>king</em> carrying his own <em>parasol</em> - typically he gets one of his attendants to do it for him (thanks to Katsuo for <em>umbrella + shape = parasol</em> and to Peppi for the story idea).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball">Thunderball</a>] 31-10-2007(22): The ancient <em>jewel</em> that is <em>shaped</em> like an <em>umbrella</em> is extremely<strong> rare</strong>, and so is hung from the chin (ちん) of the royal <em>king</em> of Mezura (めずら) to signify his importance.
