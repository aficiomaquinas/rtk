1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 5-9-2007(160): Picture the sun exploding - there would be a gigantic noise and then...nothing. Everything would plunge into<strong> darkness</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sarek05">sarek05</a>] 20-6-2008(63): In places of complete <strong>darkness</strong>, such as caves where the <em>sun</em> can&#039;t reach, creatures such as bats have learned to navigate by <em>sound</em> rather than sight. The poor guys must have to fly around screaming &quot;Marco!&quot; and &quot;Polo!&quot; all the time.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eatyoda">eatyoda</a>] 6-9-2008(45): Total<strong> darkness</strong> lacks <em>sun</em> and <em>sound</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 6-4-2008(36): In the <strong>darkness</strong> of that dank solitary confinement cell, all you can do is fantasize about <em>sun</em> and <em>sound</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 8-8-2007(29): Heisig was careless with his story for <a href="../v4/240.html">silence</a> (#240 黙). i have a really hard time confusing it for this one now.
