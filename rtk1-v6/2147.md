1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 7-1-2007(202): Ending up in a tiger&#039;s stomach is not good for your<strong> skin</strong>, as it&#039;s full of stomach acids.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thairob">thairob</a>] 8-2-2008(86): TIGGER only has visible<strong> SKIN</strong> on his STOMACH. The rest of his body is covered in orange fur.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fergal">fergal</a>] 17-11-2009(33): They say, &quot;there&#039;s more than one way to <strong>skin</strong> a cat&quot;, but if you try to <strong>skin</strong> a <em>tiger</em> you might end up in its <em>stomach</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 1-11-2007(20): Take the stomach (and guts) out of a tiger and you&#039;re left with the<strong> skin</strong> (to use as a rug etc.).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 9-10-2007(9): When the <em>tiger</em> was autopsied, they cut open his <em>stomach</em> and pulled out a human with only his<strong> skin</strong> left. It sort of looked like a deflated blow up doll.
