1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 1-5-2006(280): <strong>Penal</strong> servitude is served until indications show that one has had a change of heart (learned one&#039;s lesson). Easily confused with <a href="../v4/679.html">punish</a> (#679 刑) and <a href="../v4/833.html">penalty</a> (#833 罰). Concentrate on the reasons behind the<strong> penal</strong> system (&quot;changing people&#039;s hearts&quot; here), instead of the<strong> penal</strong>ty itself or the punishment (revenge) aspect. It may help to note that there&#039;s no sword, but a heart :-) (Note: 懲りる = learn from one&#039;s bad experiences).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256">cjon256</a>] 1-5-2009(170): Judge: You will serve a<strong> penal</strong> sentence until <em>indications</em> show you have a <em>heart</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tcjeff">tcjeff</a>] 13-6-2008(28): <strong>Penal</strong> servitude is served until <em>indications</em> show that one has had a change of <em>heart</em>. In other words, when your <em>i</em><strong>Indications</strong> changes from &quot;I&quot;M A BADASS <em>MOUNTAIN KING TASKMASTER</em>&quot; to &quot;I <em>heart</em> the world&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cingold">cingold</a>] 21-9-2009(20): The <em>indications</em> of a good <em>heart</em> are what is required to get you out of the<strong> penal</strong> system.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 10-2-2009(7): <strong>Penal</strong> servitude is served until <em>indications</em> show that one has had a change of <em>heart</em>. Remember in <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>, Morgan Freeman wasn&#039;t released on parole until he had such a change of heart.
