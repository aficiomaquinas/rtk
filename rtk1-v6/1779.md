1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 7-3-2007(201): The newspaper pages are hung on the <em>clotheseline</em> to dry and then cut down with a <em>sabre</em> to be <strong>publish</strong>ed.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 31-5-2007(93): The newspaper pages are hung on the <em>clotheseline</em> to dry. This gives the government a chance to censor the news: they cut up unwanted stories with a <em>sabre</em>. Therefore, only state-approved stories are <strong>published</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nakome">nakome</a>] 20-6-2008(57): The author&#039;s work was so <em>dry</em> that he had to threaten the<strong> publish</strong>er with a <em>sabre</em> in order to get them to<strong> publish</strong> it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 22-7-2008(24): <em>Cut</em> and <em>dried</em> - yeah, that sounds like most of the drivel<strong> publish</strong>ed nowadays.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mclin">mclin</a>] 9-4-2009(18): I can&#039;t<strong> publish</strong> this. It&#039;s too <em>dry</em>. Don&#039;t you have any stories with people getting attacked with <em>sabre</em>s or something?
