1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 25-10-2005(219): A<strong> chirp</strong> is quite simply the sound that comes from the mouth of birds.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 24-7-2008(91): This kanji is not limited to the<strong> chirp</strong> of a <em>bird</em>, but stands for the sound of any kind of animal. Picture a very weird bird that can imitate with its <em>mouth</em> (a bird with mouth, heh) the voice of many different animals: Meeow! Woof! Mooo! Cuack!!! (Maybe the bird has Kirby powers and obtains the abilities of the animals it eats).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/testoman">testoman</a>] 23-9-2008(15): Addition to DrJones&#039; story: the bird that can mimic other animals (and then some!) is a Lyrebird. Check <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjE0Kdfos4Y">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjE0Kdfos4Y</a> to see one in action.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 27-7-2011(4): <strong>Chirp</strong> is the sound which comes from the <em>mouths</em> of <em>birds</em>.
