1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 13-9-2006(189): Bringing a <em>sheep</em> to sacrifice on the <em>altar</em> was a sign of an<strong> auspicious</strong> life. The poor could only afford a pigeon, the more<strong> auspicious</strong> an expensive <em>sheep</em> for an offering.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 24-5-2007(73): On this <strong>ewe-spicious</strong> occasion, you sacrifice a <em>sheep</em> at the <em>altar</em>. —— Sorry, but I really need more than generic altar sacrifices to connect keywords to stories. Sometimes an egregious pun is the only way.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 16-3-2007(57): Once a year, the people pray for a sign from the gods. If the gods are pleased, they send down a <em>sheep</em> to the <em>altar</em>. The people see this as an<strong> auspicious</strong> gift; the wool and milk from this sheep is considered holy. But the gods think of it as a witty joke, since it&#039;s just a metaphor for the people following ancient rituals like blind sheep. Continued in <a href="../v4/1291.html">calamity</a> (#1291 禍).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 13-2-2008(29): It&#039;s an<strong> auspicious</strong> sign when you go to the <em>altar</em> and the <em>sheep</em> is already beside it, ready to go.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 18-1-2007(23): <strong>Auspicious</strong> (adj): contraction of &quot;Australia&quot; and &quot;delicious&quot;; a sheep is placed on an &quot;australian altar&quot;, or &quot;barbie&quot;, on an<strong> auspicious</strong> occasion to celebrate.
