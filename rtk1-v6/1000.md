1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 5-1-2008(277): Note this character means<strong> sort</strong> in the sense of what kind, I believe a better keyword would be &quot;variety&quot; and this character does appear in some dictionaries with the primary meaning as variety, my story: I&#039;m in a Chinese restaurant and the waiter says &quot;What<strong> sort</strong> of <em>rice</em> would you like with your <em>dog head</em>?&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 28-8-2007(118): What<strong> SORT</strong> of person comes from the U.S.? Well, some would say a person with a BIG HEAD.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 29-6-2008(102): <em>Condi Rice</em> is the<strong> SORT</strong> of person that would give HEADaches to a BIG DOG.....This story has been edited because of people reporting it. I like it better without &quot;aches&quot;, but whatever works for you!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 2-5-2007(49): (Compilation of raulir&#039;s and Raichu&#039;s stories). Various types of food are enumerated on the <em>page</em> (maybe a menu): in the upper half you see vegetarian <strong>sorts</strong> of food (such as <em>rice</em>), and in the lower half you see <strong>sorts</strong> of meat dishes (such as <em>St. Bernard dog</em>&#039;s meat).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mclin">mclin</a>] 29-1-2009(23): There are many<strong> sort</strong>s of <em>rice</em> in Japan. Some are as <em>big</em> as your <em>head</em>!
