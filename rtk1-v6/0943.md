3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pageturner1988">pageturner1988</a>] 18-12-2007(36): I&#039;m not sure where Heisig gets the<strong> junior</strong> keyword, but this kanji is more often used in the sense of either futile (e.g. 徒労 - fruitless efforts) or group(gang) member (e.g. 聖徒 - disciple, キリスト教徒 - Christian). I&#039;ll use gang member for this one. The<strong> junior</strong> <strong>gang member</strong> is going to represent at the running competition.
