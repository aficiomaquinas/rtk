1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 28-4-2007(171): Having a <em>word</em> with the <em>next mouth</em> over, like a neighbor, is usually a good way to<strong> consult with</strong> somebody for cheap. Because, you know, actual consultants charge huge sums.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/g33kette">g33kette</a>] 4-3-2008(96): &quot;Consulting with&quot; is having <em>words</em> with the <em>next mouth</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 10-3-2009(57): Don&#039;t like the <em>words</em> of the first one?<strong> Consult with</strong> the <em>next mouth</em> available.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 6-10-2006(12): If you&#039;ve ever had to deal with <strong>consultants</strong> in business, you&#039;ll find that once you bring in one, there&#039;s always a reason to drag in more; a real drain on your resources. So I see this as the constant steam of <em>words</em> from the <em>next mouth</em>, all telling you that you need more <strong>conultants</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/burritokun">burritokun</a>] 26-8-2008(10): Tim Allen always used to <em>speak</em> and<strong> consult with</strong> his <em>next</em> door neighbor, Wilson. You could never see Wilson&#039;s whole face, just his <em>mouth</em>.
