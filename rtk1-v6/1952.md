heisig: "This kanji, also used for Yen, is one you are not likely to need to study formally, since you can hardly get around in Japan without it. The connection is that the yennies, like pennies, are <b>circular</b> in shape. In any case, the elements are: <i>glass canopy</i> . . . <i>walking stick</i> . . . <i>one</i>."

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 28-1-2006(40): A poor old man is almost killing himself trying to lift a huge <em>glass hood</em> with his <em>cane</em> (using it as a lever), to get to just <em>one</em> yen coin. Note : the kanji refers to a circular, round object, but also to the Japanese currency (pronounced &quot;en&quot;).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 27-5-2007(27): A pictograph of a bank teller&#039;s window. The<strong> circle</strong>s are the coins which are passed back and forth for deposits and withdrawls.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-9-2008(15): Sometimes I wear my <em>top hat</em> under my <em>hood</em> and it makes my head look like a<strong> circle</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 24-2-2008(14): You may wonder why this character is pronounced &#039;en&#039; yet is said &#039;yen&#039; in the west, well this is because when it was first romanized the obsolete ゑ character was used and as such became yen in the west.
