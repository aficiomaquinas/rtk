heisig: "Maestro . . . road."
primit: "maestro To go with this primitive meaning, you might picture a tuxedo-clad maestro waving his baton about wildly. The baton is seen in the drop at the top. And the two boxes attached to the long vertical stroke may represent his tuxedo tails, if you wish. [6]"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 14-2-2007(222): <em>Maestro</em>, coattails flapping wildly, is being <strong>chase</strong>d down the <em>road</em> by his fans.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sleepyday">sleepyday</a>] 26-10-2008(51): This Kanji reminds me of Nodame Cantabile. I just have to imagine Chiaki, our <em>maestro</em> in training, getting<strong> chase</strong>d by Nodame down the <em>road</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 8-4-2007(50): <em>Maestro</em> primative = <em>James Bond</em>. Here he gives<strong> chase</strong> down the <em>road</em> to the bad guys. I&#039;m thinking of the car<strong> chase</strong> in &#039;The Man with the Golden Gun&#039; - NOT <a href="../v4/539">pursue</a> (#539 逐). I think about &#039;Race N<strong> Chase</strong>&#039; (a scalextric type toy)...there were no pigs in &#039;Race N<strong> Chase</strong>&#039;, only cars.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 2-3-2011(33): I&#039;m going to use Beyonce as the primitive meaning. She&#039;s a bit of a musical maestro herself AND she has an amazing butt, so all the bases are covered. Plus the radical looks like a &#039;B&#039;! So this kanji is a pictograph of me <strong>chasing</strong> gorgeous <em>Beyonce</em> down the <em>road</em>. Mmm, Beyonce! (drool). 追う おう run after, drive out; 追い付く おいつく overtake, catch up (with); 追放 ついほう banishment, exile; 追加 ついか supplement, addition.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jslindst">jslindst</a>] 6-3-2009(9): I use Bond for the Maestro (the primitive also resembles B). Here you see James <em>Bond</em> being<strong> chase</strong>d on a road.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 1-8-2006(8): <em>Maestro</em> has but to see the <em>road</em> to hear the great <strong>chase</strong> scene music he will create!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 29-3-2009(6): Believing he&#039;s being<strong> chase</strong>d, <em>Beethoven</em> (the <em>maestro</em> with more than just a <em>drop</em> of lead poisoning), runs down the <em>road</em>, a sad victim of deafness and mental illness. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven#Loss_of_hearing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven#Loss_of_hearing</a>).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wazato">wazato</a>] 4-3-2010(5): I will use Seinfeld for the maestro primitive. It&#039;s easy if you ever saw that episode (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maestro">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maestro</a>). For the<strong> chase</strong> primitive, Kramer is being<strong> chase</strong>d down the road after the guy he was betting on airplanes with thought that he was cheating. The guy was a big, Texan okanemochi type and was really pissed when he thought Kramer was cheating on the bets. Picture Kramer running down the street with those longs legs and crazy hair.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jmcanally">jmcanally</a>] 19-1-2010(4): Bouncing butt Beyonce is being<strong> chase</strong>d by fans down the street.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sskaggs">sskaggs</a>] 5-8-2011(3): Mnemonic: Heres the maestro, on the road, his baton in perfect rhythm. --- It&#039;s his bad first try with a marching band, --- see him<strong> chase</strong> instead of lead them.
