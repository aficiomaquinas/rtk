1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 5-9-2007(234): Nobody likes the<strong> tax</strong> man, so here it is only fitting that the person who comes over to take some of your <em>wheat</em> is depicted here as a devil. Keep in mind that in feudal societies there was no kind of money to speak of, so<strong> tax</strong>es were paid by serfs in <em>wheat</em> to the <em>devils</em> who came over to keep them poor.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku">genbaku</a>] 11-1-2008(98): This is an easy one.<strong> Tax</strong>es is like the devil taking away your hard earned wheat.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei">javiergakusei</a>] 22-7-2007(21): I don&#039;t know if it makes sense, but it works for me: If the Warrior cannot levy the shells [frame 378], then the Devil will come and colllect your Wheat as<strong> Tax</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 20-4-2008(11): &quot;No, mister<strong> tax</strong> man, please no! Anything but this! Please don&#039;t take our <em>bread</em> away! how shall I feed my <em>horny teenager</em> now?&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pangolin">Pangolin</a>] 21-12-2008(9): When the church takes 10% of your <em>wheat</em> harvest, it&#039;s a tithe. When the <em>devil</em> takes it, it&#039;s a<strong> tax</strong>.
