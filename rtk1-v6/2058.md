1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 1-7-2007(211): The famers take it in<strong> turn</strong>s to watch out for any animal tracks on their rice field.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Biene">Biene</a>] 4-5-2008(38): (modified thegeezer3) <em>Animal tracks</em> were found in the <em>rice field</em>, now the kids of the farmer take it in<strong> turn</strong>s to keep watch and hinder the animals to make more <em>animal tracks</em> in their precious <em>rice field</em>. They roll the <em>dice</em> to decide in what order they have to keep watch and when everyones<strong> turn</strong> is.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 7-7-2007(32): [turn; number in a series] Ok, I&#039;m done - now it&#039;s your <strong>turn</strong> to count the <em>drops</em> of <em>rice</em> in the <em>rice field</em>...

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavin.schultz-ohkubo">gavin.schultz-ohkubo</a>] 20-11-2010(26): I find &quot;turn&quot; alone is too generic to remember, so I add an additional keyword, <strong>numerical order</strong>. This is perhaps the most common context in which this kanji is found, e.g. 1st, 2nd = <a href="midori://search?text=一番、二番">一番、二番</a> . Story: I see <em>animal tracks</em> leading to the <em>rice field</em> and start to worry, but then see the <strong>numerical order</strong> in which the tracks are made: 一番 mouse tracks, 二番 cat tracks, 三番 dog tracks, then 四番 lion tracks. Looks like the rice is safe.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimitha">jimitha</a>] 3-11-2009(11): (I use <em>animal droppings</em> instead of <em>animal tracks</em> to avoid confusion.) Story: Workers slack off in the <em>rice field</em> taking<strong> turn</strong>s at a dice game, using <em>animal droppings</em> as the dice (for lack of other implements). What game are they playing? Craps, of course.
