3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 21-9-2009(38): If you are familiar with the Monkey legends ( 西遊記 Journey to the West) there is a good image for this character: While <strong>search</strong>ing for the end of the universe, <em>monkey</em> reaches to his <em>crotch</em> and urinates on Buddha&#039;s <em>fingers</em>. (Update: new link <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYXFppaKLL4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYXFppaKLL4</a>).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ambassadog">ambassadog</a>] 26-10-2009(23): Heard about the fourth wise <em>monkey</em>? Often overlooked after Hear, See and Speak no Evil, he&#039;s <strong>Seek</strong> no Evil. Picture the four famous monkeys at Nikko, the fourth covering his <em>crotch</em> with his <em>fingers</em>, showing he won&#039;t be <strong>searching</strong> for any evil deeds in that evil place.

Just ask yourself what the monkey was<strong> search</strong>ing for: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ICaFDq8_Ik&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ICaFDq8_Ik&amp;feature=related</a> (or youtube<strong> search</strong>: &quot;monkey ass&quot;).
