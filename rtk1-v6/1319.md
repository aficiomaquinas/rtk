1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 19-9-2006(255): Perhaps a pictograph of a soldier&#039;s weapons--his sword and bow-placed ceremonially over his body before burial, while people offer their<strong> condolences</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 24-6-2007(80): Send your<strong> condolences</strong> to the old geezer whom you shot the <em>walking stick</em> into with your <em>bow</em>. (see <a href="../v4/1232">pull</a> (#1232 引)).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 12-1-2008(50): Don&#039;t confuse with <a href="../v4/985">reparation</a> (#985 償), <a href="../v4/476">compensation</a> (#476 賠).<strong> Condolences</strong> aren&#039;t monetary or physical; it&#039;s just a letter. &quot;Dear wife, your bungling soldier husband tried to string his <em>bow</em> with his <em>walking stick</em>, which of course failed. He was promptly killed by enemy fire. Our<strong> condolences</strong>.&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thora">Thora</a>] 30-4-2008(22): A dead soldier&#039;s <em>bow</em> and <em>walking staff</em> unceremoniously delivered to his widow with a note: &quot;Our<strong> condolences</strong>&quot;. That&#039;s it. Heartless. At least &quot;consolation&quot; has some &quot;heart&quot;. [In case you used a soldier&#039;s death in both stories].

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 17-6-2009(14): The enemy archer kills your friend. Then, seeing how upset you are, he mocks you by offering his<strong> condolences</strong> by using his <em>bow</em> and <em>walking stick</em> like a violin to play a sad song.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penot">penot</a>] 29-11-2008(8): My <strong>condolences</strong> on your lost - I didn&#039;t realise this <em><strong>bow</strong></em> was armed (with a vertical line walking stick). // CONFUSION with <a href="../v4/1096">consolation</a> (#1096 慰) // con<strong>do</strong>lences - think of kyu<strong>do</strong> (archery) //con<strong>s</strong>olation - think of <strong>s</strong>pecial corps military officer. // とむら·う、 とぶら·う //チョウ diao4 조 (jo) 적 (jeog).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 1-6-2009(5): Dude, your arrow got tangled in your <em>bow</em>? Bummer - my<strong> condolences</strong>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yLaguardia">yLaguardia</a>] 10-6-2012(3): There&#039;s LEGOLAS impaled on the WALKING stick of saruman. My<strong> condolences</strong> to rivendell. To not confuse with <em>consolation</em>, I notice that only condo<strong>le</strong>nces have the <strong>le</strong> of <strong>le</strong>golas.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko">Nuriko</a>] 23-3-2008(3): A spin on Raichu&#039;s story (I thought the idea of using a soldier&#039;s weapon would confuse me with spear or saber). Instead I pictured an old man who has just died, body decrepit and twisted like a bow, and after becoming so attached to his walking stick he clasps it even in death as people make their<strong> condolences</strong>.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tenken3">tenken3</a>] 4-2-2008(3): My<strong> condolences</strong>, while I was doing some pulling (last frame), the stick got lodged into your bow!
