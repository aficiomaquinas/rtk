primit: "grow up As the plant grows up it sprouts leaves and a stalk, which are depicted here over a single horizontal stroke for the soil. Think of something (its relative primitive) growing up in a flash to many times its normal size, much like little Alice in Wonderland, who grew up so fast she was soon larger than the room in which she was sitting. [4]"
heisig: "Grow up . . . breasts."

Have you ever wondered what happened to <em>Peter Pans</em> mother? My guess is he<strong> poison</strong>ed her.
