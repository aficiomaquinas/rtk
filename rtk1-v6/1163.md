1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 27-7-2007(228): I see the story of Hachiko: the faithfull dog who still waited for his master to return long after he had died. Brings a tear to the eye.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 28-3-2007(147): <strong>Tears</strong> are watery (<em>water</em> + <em>re</em>).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 4-6-2006(35): When my dog (who was about as big as a <em>St. Bernard</em>) got quite old, he had to be put down. The last thing that I saw was him lying on the table staring at me before the vet shut the <em>door</em>. The way he looked at me, I swear he knew that his time was over. Dogs don&#039;t shed<strong> tears</strong> but if he could have I think he would have at that time.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RobMow">RobMow</a>] 16-9-2008(31): The master shed<strong> tears</strong> of joy when his lost dog returned to his doorstep. (See <a href="../v4/1081">re-</a> (#1081 戻)).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kalin">kalin</a>] 16-9-2008(25): Futurama: Fry&#039;s dog, Seymour, waiting for him outside the pizza shop. T_T.
