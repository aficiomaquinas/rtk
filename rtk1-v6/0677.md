1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 27-10-2007(337): <strong>Humility</strong> is the <em>state of mind</em> of accepting the <em>truth</em> about yourself - both favorable and unfavorable. (tweaked version of Raichu&#039;s).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 3-9-2006(95): <strong>Humility</strong> is a state of mind when you consider yourself in accordance with the truth (you neither boast nor demean yourself).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scout">scout</a>] 6-12-2007(28): <em>Data</em>, who is convinced he is perfect, is taught a lesson in<strong> humility</strong> when Riker shows him how to extract truth from someone by placing them on a <em>workbench</em> and poking them in the <em>eye</em> with a <em>needle</em>. Data just didn&#039;t understand how to play with the person&#039;s state of mind.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wosret">Wosret</a>] 13-1-2009(26): <strong>Humility</strong> is <strong>the state of mind</strong> of accepting the <strong>truth</strong> no matter how much you don&#039;t like it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 9-8-2007(24): <em>Data</em> has great <strong>humility</strong> even though he knows more <em>truth</em> than any human.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 29-3-2009(18): Data, Riker and Worf are talking about hooking up with Troi. Riker and Worf are bragging but Data shows<strong> HUMILITY</strong> and doesn&#039;t tell them the TRUTH about how he made her scream TEN times in one night. There&#039;s no way they can compete with his robo-TOOL. Just picture Data hanging back being humble while these two macho guys have no clue this android nerd loved up their lady better than they ever had.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/breton">breton</a>] 14-2-2008(13): <strong>Humility</strong> is the state of mind you are after admitting the truth about your true ability to speak Japanese.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 2-9-2007(10): A mark of<strong> HUMILITY</strong> is keeping your<strong> HUMILITY</strong> even when you know the <em>truth</em> of a situation. <em>Data</em> is a prime example of this - whenever he is forced to tell somebody the <em>truth</em>, he does it in a very <em>HUMBLE</em> way. &quot;Actually, captain, water will not burn under normal temperatures&quot;. I need to learn this lesson as well - to emulate <em>Data</em> and show<strong> HUMILITY</strong> when I am telling people <em>truths</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/QuantumSquirrel">QuantumSquirrel</a>] 21-1-2009(8): <em>Data</em> doesn&#039;t know<strong> humility</strong>, he always tells the <em>truth</em> when asked about his abilities.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TunS77">TunS77</a>] 15-9-2008(7): <strong>Humility</strong> is the <em>true state of mind</em>.
