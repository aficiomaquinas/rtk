1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 18-1-2007(150): To keep this distinct from other kanji such as &quot;watchtower&quot; and &quot;pagoda&quot;, I use the mnemonic &quot;<em>towering<strong> tower</strong></em>&quot;. -- In some old 8-bit kung-fu videogame, with a plot similar as Bruce Lee&#039;s last, unfinished movie, the hero must break through a <em>gate</em> at <em>each</em> level of the<strong> tower</strong>ing<strong> tower</strong>, fighting with opponents using various styles of kung-fu until he meets the finale at the topmost level of the &quot;towering<strong> tower</strong>&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Proxx">Proxx</a>] 27-11-2007(65): Remember the two<strong> tower</strong>s from lord of the rings... <em>each</em> has it&#039;s own - very difficult to master - entrance <em>gate</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 9-7-2009(49): <em>Each lesbian</em> waits for her turn with &quot;the<strong> tower</strong>&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/walexander5">walexander5</a>] 6-9-2008(44): There is a<strong> tower</strong> on each side of the gate, they are posts for archers.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 15-7-2008(18): Since<strong> tower</strong> confuses me too much with other Kanji, I will use (political) CABINET instead, where this Kanji is frequently used. The CABINET decides that EACH GATE of a saloon has to have a sign saying that you have to be an adult to be allowed to drink there.
