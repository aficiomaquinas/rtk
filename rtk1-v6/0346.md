heisig: "The <i>child</i> in the little red <i>schoolhouse</i> is there for one reason only: to <b>study</b>. Anyone who has gone through the schooling system knows well enough that <b>study</b> is one thing and <i>learning</i> quite another again. In the kanji, too, the character for <i>learning&nbsp;</i>(Frame 616) has nothing to do with the <i>schoolhouse</i>."
primit: "schoolhouse Here we see a little red schoolhouse with the 3 dots on the roof. As you write it in the following FRAMEs, you should acquire a &quot;feel&quot; for the way the first two short strokes move left to right, and the the third one right to left. Write it twice now, saying to yourself the first time as you write the first 3 strokes, &quot;In the schoolhouse we learn our A-B-Cs,&quot; and the second time, &quot;In the schoolhouse we learn our 1-2-fis.&quot; [5]"
