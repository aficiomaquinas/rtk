heisig: "Any way you count them, there are either too many or too few fingers to see a good pictograph of a <b>hand</b> in this character. But that it is, and so you must."
commen: "* Keep to the etymology when using this kanji as a primitive: a single <i>hand</i> all by itself."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 31-1-2007(99): This pictograph actually really works if you look at it as a<strong> hand</strong> with fingers spread and middle finger pointing down. see the very top stroke as the edge of a shirt cuff, and it will all come together.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 4-8-2009(86): A<strong> hand</strong> is useful for 千一 (1001) things.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 25-2-2007(33): Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die. (the 6-fingered man).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 23-11-2006(13): Heisig says it&#039;s not a very good pictograph of a human<strong> hand</strong>, but it <em>is</em> a good pictograph of a cartoon<strong> hand</strong>. Picture Mickey Mouse&#039;s distinctive white glove with its three fingers and a thumb. The kanji that use this element can also use <em>Mickey Mouse</em> as a primitive element in place of <em>hand</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tornadic_Indignation">Tornadic_Indignation</a>] 4-5-2009(7): The slightly bent <em>nail</em> went through <em>two</em> of the <strong>hand</strong>&#039;s fingers (this one is pretty easy to memorize).
