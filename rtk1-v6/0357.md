heisig: "Of all the things we can do with our <i>mouths</i>, speech is the one that requires the greatest distinctness and clarity. Hence the kanji for <b>say</b> has four little sound-waves, indicating the complexity of the achievement."
commen: "* This kanji, which appears often as a primitive, can mean <i>saying</i>, <i>speech</i>, or <i>words</i>, depending on which is most useful."

Just make Socrates the subject of your stories and whenever Socrates shows up you&#039;ll know this character should be written. Just picture him in his toga with a hand up in the air looking philisophical. You can try some other well spoken individual as long as they bring to mind speech, words, or<strong> say</strong>.
