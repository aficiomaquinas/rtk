heisig: "Our image here is made up of two primitive elements: a <i>sun</i> and a <i>measuring box</i>. Just as the <i>sun</i> can be seen <b>rising up</b> in the morning from - where else - the Land of the Rising Sun, this kanji has the <i>sun</i> <b>rising up</b> out of a Japanese <i>measuring box</i>&nbsp;- the &quot;<i>measuring box</i> of the <b>rising-up</b> <i>sun</i>.&quot;"
