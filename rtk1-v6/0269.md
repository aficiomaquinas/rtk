primit: "meeting This compound primitive depicts a meeting as a massive gathering of people under one umbrella. The full kanji from which this derives will be introduced later in FRAME 752 会. The important thing here is to picture the scene just described and associate it with the word meeting. [3]"
heisig: "The kanji for <b>fit</b> reads literally, top to bottom, as a <i>meeting</i> of <i>mouths</i>&nbsp;- which is a rather descriptive way of speaking of a romantic kiss. We all know what happens when there is no meeting of minds and when people's ideas don't <b>fit</b>&nbsp;with one another. But this kanji invites us to imagine what would happened to the romance of a certain unfortunate couple whose <i>mouths</i> didn't <b>fit</b>."
