heisig: "The kanji connoting rank or class shows us a new element on the left: the familiar primitive for <i>staples</i> with an additional stroke cutting through the vertical stroke. It is easiest in these cases to make a primitive related to what we already know. Hence, we call it a <i>staple gun</i>. To the right, <i>missile</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 25-8-2007(268): This is a military-<strong>grade</strong> <em>staple gun</em>! It can be loaded with real <em>missiles</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball">Thunderball</a>] 24-9-2007(50): In order to get your 1st<strong> grade</strong>, or first-dan (だん) black belt, you have to learn hand to hand combat with new weapons - first the grapple involving the <em>staple gun</em>, and then the <em>missile</em> deployment technique.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko">Nuriko</a>] 8-4-2008(39): Imagine a really mean teacher who<strong> grade</strong>s papers with a staple-gun that shoots out staples (in a missile-like fashion) onto the paper to form the letter &quot;F&quot;. She even uses such an opportunity as target practice. She gets way over to the other end of the class and shoots the little &quot;staple missiles&quot; onto the paper, cackling all the while.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 6-3-2008(26): When you are first dan, your punches hurt like a staple gun. When you are 10th dan, like a missile. So 1st<strong> grade</strong> is staple gun, 10th<strong> grade</strong> is missile. OR The first dan fellas are training with staplers. The 10th dan are whirling around rocket launchers (trick is not to set it off when you are doing all kind of fancy tricks. That is why there are so few 10 dans).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jasta">Jasta</a>] 10-1-2009(9): First<strong> grade</strong>rs in the army can use <em>staple guns</em>. Only when you are of high rank can you fire a <em>missile</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup">mezbup</a>] 6-7-2009(7): In military school<strong> grade</strong> 1 they teach you how to make staple guns... in<strong> grade</strong> 10... missiles!

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavin.schultz-ohkubo">gavin.schultz-ohkubo</a>] 2-7-2010(6): Hint: many people will probably first learn this as part of 階段 (かいだん、stairs). This staircase is immune to <em>missile</em> attacks; and would you believe, this high<strong> grade</strong> staircase was made only with a high<strong> grade</strong> <em>staple gun</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 3-4-2011(4): &quot;I read the news today, oh boy. About a lucky man who made the <strong>grade</strong>. He blew his mind out in a car. He didn&#039;t notice that the <em>staple gun</em> was loaded with <em>missiles</em>&quot;... (<strong>staple gun</strong> looks like an assault rifle pointing down)... 段階 [だんかい] <a href="http://google.com/#q=、値段">、値段</a> [ねだん] <a href="http://google.com/#q=、階段">、階段</a> [かいだん] <a href="http://google.com/#q=、普段">、普段</a> [ふだん].
