heisig: "When <b>escaping</b> from something or someone, one always feels as if one is not going fast enough, like a <i>turtle</i> on an expressway. (Since the <i>turtle</i> is on the <i>road</i> and not on the left, it can keep its full kanji shape as given in frame 250.)"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Georgi87">Georgi87</a>] 3-4-2008(93): I used my pants to make a rope, which I then used to<strong> escape</strong> from prison; hence the naked, hairy legs running along the road!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton">atomiton</a>] 1-3-2010(64): MARIO KART: When you&#039;re blasting down the <strong>road</strong> in Mario Kart, it&#039;s REALLY hard to<strong> escape</strong> from <strong>turtle shells</strong>. Especially the red and blue ones!!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977">mameha1977</a>] 30-9-2007(60): When your wifes <em>legs get hairy</em> (<a href="../v4/235">portent</a> (#235 兆)) its time to hit the <em>road</em> and<strong> escape</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 11-1-2006(34): A scene right out of a 30&#039;s Cartoon. A tortoise in black-white striped jailsuit is making his<strong> escape</strong> from the prison, sirens howling and lightthrowers searching the road, where the tortoise in painful s lowness walks away looking scared.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 18-12-2007(18): If you used the meaning &quot;a person&#039;s back&quot; in <a href="../v4/235">portent</a> (#235 兆), you will have it easy here. Adopting Georgi87: I used my pants to make a rope, which I used then to<strong> escape</strong> from prison; which is why you can see <em>my back</em> while I run along the <em>road</em>!
