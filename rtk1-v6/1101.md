1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 9-2-2007(58): I <strong>sprained</strong> my <em>fingers</em> when I <em>sat in meditation</em> (by sitting in a strange position).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/algarich">algarich</a>] 10-12-2010(23): (Using the primitives in the RTK1 addendum) The workers at the <em>assembly line</em> in the coal cave (<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1024">squat/sit</a> (#1024 座)) frequently claim to &quot;<strong>sprain</strong>&quot; their <em>fingers</em> because working within all the <em>dirt</em> around them is hard and they&#039;d much rather stay at home.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-7-2009(11): I<strong> sprain</strong>ed in my <em>finger</em> doing a complicated mudra while <em>sitting in meditation</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 16-1-2010(5): You might<strong> SPRAIN</strong> your FINGERS while SITTING IN MEDITATION if you suddenly put your hand out to catch yourself after falling asleep.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Puchatek">Puchatek</a>] 5-8-2011(3): With your <em>fingers</em> you try to repair an <em>assembly</em> line that got broken after some <em>soil/dirt</em> got into it. But then the <em>assembly line</em> suddenly starts working. It spurts <em>soil</em> everywhere, and its movement also<strong> sprain</strong>s your poor <em>fingers</em>.
