1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball">Thunderball</a>] 28-10-2007(152): When you <em>lack food</em>, just<strong> drink</strong> something to fill you up.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau23">dilandau23</a>] 27-2-2007(117): In Japan, the one thing I always seem to be <em>lacking</em> with my <em>food</em> is a properer sized<strong> drink</strong>. Instead I have to<strong> drink</strong> that shot glass of water.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 3-7-2008(72): Always the same in those restaurants. You&#039;ve already received your<strong> drink</strong> and you&#039;re waiting so long for your <em>food</em> that you begin to <em>yawn</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Georgi87">Georgi87</a>] 9-4-2008(31): VERY easy! Food alone is never enough - without a<strong> drink</strong>, our meal would be lacking! After all, food lacks the water that we get from<strong> drink</strong>ing.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 17-6-2006(6): After <em>eating</em> I like to have a big <em>yawn</em> and a cool <em>drink</em>.
