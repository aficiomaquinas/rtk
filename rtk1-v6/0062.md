heisig: "The top part of the kanji in this frame, you will remember, is the character for <i>olden times</i>, those <i>days</i> so old they needed a <i>walking stick</i> to get around. Western mythical imagination has old &quot;Father Time&quot; leaning on his sickle with a <b>newborn babe</b> crawling around his <i>legs</i>, the idea being that the circle of birth and-death goes on. This is the first of three times that the kanji for <i>olden times</i> will appear as a primitive element in another kanji, so try to make the most of it."
