heisig: "Call to mind the image of a fresh, bubbling <b>spring</b> of <i>water</i>, and you will probably notice how the top of the <b>spring</b> you are thinking of, the part where the &quot;bubbling&quot; goes on, is all <i>white</i>. Happily, the <i>white</i> is just where it should be, at the top, and the <i>water</i> is at the bottom."
commen: "* We will keep this image of a <i>spring</i> when using this kanji as a primitive, but not without first drawing attention to a slight change that distinguishes the primitive from the kanji. The final 4 strokes (the element for <i>water</i>) are abbreviated to the three small drops that we learned earlier as the kanji for <i>little</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lilpea">lilpea</a>] 3-8-2007(181): <em>White</em> is a symbol of purety, so <em>white</em> <em>water</em> is pure water, the precise definition of<strong> spring</strong> water.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hikarudo">hikarudo</a>] 19-8-2008(123): Perhaps the most common appearance of this kanji is in the word 温泉 (おんせん, onsen), a Japanese hot<strong> spring</strong>. The kanji is an excellent image of someone enjoying a Japanese hot<strong> spring</strong>: a little <em>white</em> towel on top, <em>water</em> below. (This helps keep all associations:<strong> spring</strong>, little and onsen).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 18-2-2008(43): A fresh<strong> SPRING</strong> has plenty of frothy <em>white</em> bubbles in its crisp, cool <em>water</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99">dshill99</a>] 3-2-2008(23): A<strong> spring</strong> has <em>white</em> frothy <em>water</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akane99">akane99</a>] 8-7-2010(7): When<strong> SPRING</strong> comes, <em>white</em> snow melts and becomes <em>water</em>.
