1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 25-12-2007(188): I <strong>miss</strong> my parents dearly. Here they lay, under a big <em>cross</em>, their <em>mouths</em> side by side. I stick <em>hairpins</em> in their graves. CAREFUL: the stroke order/primitive order is: ten, L mouth, R mouth, hairpin. &quot;Soil&quot; is not drawn in its stroke order.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tristanthorn">tristanthorn</a>] 18-3-2009(104): <em>Ten</em> days ago, our <em>two mouths</em> met for the last time... then she gave me her <em>hairpin</em> as a sayounara gift. How I<strong> miss</strong> my Geisha girl...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laxxy">laxxy</a>] 30-10-2006(76): This kanji means<strong> miss</strong> as in &quot;miss a (dearly departed) person&quot;, not as in &quot;miss a target&quot;. Here the dearly departed has been buried in the ground, with her favourite hairpin in place of a gravestone, and two mourners stand around crying with open mouths.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 6-1-2006(15): The miner<strong> miss</strong>es his<strong> miss</strong> (his sweetheart). So much <em>soil</em> is separating his <em>mouth</em> from hers (working as a miner deep below the ground). She left him a <em>hairpin</em> as a good-luck trinket.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BooBooQ88">BooBooQ88</a>] 15-12-2009(12): We tried to kiss ten times but our 2 mouths<strong> MISS</strong>ED every time. She got upset and threw her hairpin at me.
