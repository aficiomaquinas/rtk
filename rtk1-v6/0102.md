heisig: "You have probably seen somewhere the form of a squatting <b>woman</b> drawn behind this character, with two legs at the bottom, two arms (the horizontal line) and the head poking out the top. A little farfetched, until you draw the character and feel the grace and flow of the three simple strokes. Remembering the kanji is easy; being able to write it beautifully is another thing."
commen: "* The primitive meaning is the same: <i>woman</i>."
