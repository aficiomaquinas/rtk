3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 20-10-2007(40): The<strong> INHERIT</strong>ANCE given to SPIDERMAN was only RICE, because it came from his &quot;Uncle Ben&quot;, ha ha ha, get the HOOK? &quot;Uncle Ben&quot; RICE?

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bigloui">bigloui</a>] 12-4-2006(11): A poor chinese farmer could expect to<strong> inherit</strong>: the <em>thread</em> of life, a <em>hook</em> for catching something to eat, and some <em>rice</em> to live off of.
