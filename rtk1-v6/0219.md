heisig: "What makes a <i>tree</i> begin to <b>wither</b> up, and perhaps even die, is a kind of arteriosclerosis that keeps its sap from flowing freely. Usually this is due to simple <i>old age</i>, as this character shows us. Be sure to picture a wrinkled <i>old tree</i>, <b>withering</b> away in a retirement center so that the commonsense explanation does not take over."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun">sutebun</a>] 16-10-2007(189): A tree<strong> wither</strong>s away as it gets old.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 15-11-2007(68): When flowers get old they <em>suffer</em> (frame 225), but <em>old trees</em> just<strong> WITHER</strong> away painlessly. (Picture flowers crying in pain, but a dried up tree silent and sad).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu">Kurisu</a>] 28-1-2008(17): The <em>tree</em> is <em>old</em> and <strong>withered</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 15-3-2009(7): I had trouble remembering this one using tree and old, so I just thought of what the <em>wood</em> of an <em>old</em> man would look like, and that did the trick.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 29-5-2006(7): When flowers get old they are said to be <em>suffering</em> (225) but there is no sympathy for the poor <em>old tree</em> which simply<strong> wither</strong>s!
