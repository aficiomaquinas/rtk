heisig: "&quot;In the <b>beginning</b>...&quot;&nbsp;starts that marvelous shelf of books we call the Bible. It talks about how all things were made, and tells us that when the Creator came to humanity she made <i>two</i> of them, man and woman. While we presume she made <i>two</i> of every other animal as well, we are not told as much. Hence we need only&nbsp;<i>two</i> and a pair of <i>human legs</i> come to the kanji that means <b>beginning</b>."

Woman replied, &quot;Well, you know how I have <em>two</em> eyes, <em>two</em> arms, <em>two legs</em>... it seems redundant to have three breasts. It would look more symmetrical with <em>two</em>.&quot; God nodded, and the middle breast fell off... and it was good. Woman picked up the breast and said, &quot;Thank you, God! But what do I do with this useless boob?&quot; And God created man. That&#039;s why the women today only have <em>two</em> boobs to match their <em>two human legs</em>.
