1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 16-3-2007(319): Keep<strong> distant</strong> from a <em>lidded crock</em> on the<em> road</em> wrapped in a <em>scarf</em>. It might be a bomb.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eieneverafter">eieneverafter</a>] 3-3-2008(27): When traveling to a<strong> distant</strong> land, what better way of keeping warm on the road is there than carrying a warm lidded crock and wearing a scarf?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ojousan">ojousan</a>] 29-10-2009(23): (NOTE: I am combining <em>lidded crock</em> and <em>scarf</em> into one NEW PRIMITIVE: <em>picnic</em>. As in, a <em>lidded crock</em> is filled with the food and the <em>scarf</em> is the picnic blanket.) When I&#039;m on the <em>road</em> to <strong>distant</strong> lands and know there will be quite a <strong>distance</strong> between proper <em>road</em>side stops, I&#039;m always extra careful and bring a <em>picnic</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/whistler11">whistler11</a>] 19-11-2006(16): In a game called &#039;spin the <em>lidded-crock</em>&#039;, contestants see how far<strong> distant</strong> they can roll a crock down the <em>road</em> by wrapping it in a <em>scarf</em> and spinning it like a top; the only rule is that the lid must stay on the crock. Picture a referee measuring the distance on the <em>road</em> to see how far<strong> distant</strong> you&#039;ve spun the crock.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic">anthropic</a>] 17-5-2008(14): It is best to stay <strong>distant</strong> from the <em>dirt</em>y <em>mouth</em>ed wino with the tatty <em>scarf</em> laying on the <em>road</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 9-1-2006(11): I visited a<strong> distant</strong> (as in living far away) relative. On the <em>road</em> on the way back I realized that I had all my <em>clothes except my hat</em>. Where on earth was it? Oh yes, my relative needed it to keep his <em>lidded crock</em> warm.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SoDesuKa">SoDesuKa</a>] 21-5-2009(10): The road to your destination is so<strong> distant</strong> that the <em>dirt</em> will get to your <em>mouth</em> and <em>clothes</em>.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koiulpoi">koiulpoi</a>] 22-9-2009(8): Who&#039;s that off in the distance, walking down the <em>road</em>? They&#039;re wearing a <em>long kimono</em>, but they&#039;re too far; I can&#039;t tell who it is.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LovelyLaura">LovelyLaura</a>] 8-6-2010(6): Travelling roads in<strong> distant</strong> lands, dirt was blown into my mouth, so I had to wear a scarf.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bexinkyushu">bexinkyushu</a>] 21-2-2011(5): This is the first time we see the <em>Hobbit</em>&#039;s full form (see COTTAGE for using 土 and 口 together to mean <em>Hobbit</em>). He has escaped from his cottage under the Hill. Imagine seeing him on the road, heading off on a<strong> distant</strong> adventure. The garment element has been reduced to it&#039;s simpler form because he is<strong> distant</strong>.
