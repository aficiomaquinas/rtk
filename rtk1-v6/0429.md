1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 16-3-2007(319): Keep<strong> distant</strong> from a <em>lidded crock</em> on the<em> road</em> wrapped in a <em>scarf</em>. It might be a bomb.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eieneverafter">eieneverafter</a>] 3-3-2008(27): When traveling to a<strong> distant</strong> land, what better way of keeping warm on the road is there than carrying a warm lidded crock and wearing a scarf?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ojousan">ojousan</a>] 29-10-2009(23): (NOTE: I am combining <em>lidded crock</em> and <em>scarf</em> into one NEW PRIMITIVE: <em>picnic</em>. As in, a <em>lidded crock</em> is filled with the food and the <em>scarf</em> is the picnic blanket.) When I&#039;m on the <em>road</em> to <strong>distant</strong> lands and know there will be quite a <strong>distance</strong> between proper <em>road</em>side stops, I&#039;m always extra careful and bring a <em>picnic</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/whistler11">whistler11</a>] 19-11-2006(16): In a game called &#039;spin the <em>lidded-crock</em>&#039;, contestants see how far<strong> distant</strong> they can roll a crock down the <em>road</em> by wrapping it in a <em>scarf</em> and spinning it like a top; the only rule is that the lid must stay on the crock. Picture a referee measuring the distance on the <em>road</em> to see how far<strong> distant</strong> you&#039;ve spun the crock.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic">anthropic</a>] 17-5-2008(14): It is best to stay <strong>distant</strong> from the <em>dirt</em>y <em>mouth</em>ed wino with the tatty <em>scarf</em> laying on the <em>road</em>.
