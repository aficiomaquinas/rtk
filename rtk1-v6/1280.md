primit: "haystack The three needles stacked up give us a haystack (in which it may be harder to find the hay than the needles). In the rare case in which there is nothing underneath this element, as in the following FRAME, the last three strokes are written virtually the same as two hands--that is, the second stroke sweeps down slightly to the left. [5]"
heisig: "The hustle and <b>bustle</b> of this character is depicted by a <i>St. Bernard dog</i> and a <i>haystack</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 11-12-2007(170): Hustle and<strong> bustle</strong> = a big <em>St. Bernard dog</em> frisking about in a <em>haystack</em>, knocking it down and spreading the hay about, after the field hands just stacked it up.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 30-10-2006(90): A<strong> bustle</strong> is also the name for the big wire-framed skirts that women used to wear. Here&#039;s a <em>St. Bernard dog</em> jammed ass-first into the top of a <em>haystack</em>, looking like some kind of proper Victorian-era lady as he struggles to get out.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 13-3-2008(73): (note: easier way to remember haystack - it&#039;s just as difficult to find a needle in a haystack, even if you use two hands) Farmers hustling and bustling to move big haystacks.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cheechuan">cheechuan</a>] 9-3-2008(41): In the hustle and<strong> bustle</strong> of NYC, you suddenly find this humongous <em>haystack</em> and a giant <em>St. Bernard</em> sitting on top of it, howling Christmas songs. Nobody even stops to look....only in NYC.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/imagia">imagia</a>] 27-8-2008(12): - I had trouble using the haystack primitive without &quot;money&quot; as in the following frames, so I&#039;ve separated the elements out to make sure I don&#039;t put &quot;money&quot; into this kanji. Whenever you come across any<strong> BUSTLE</strong>, there&#039;s a simple solution for getting through. Get your St Bernard and prick him with a needle - he&#039;ll cut right through the<strong> BUSTLE</strong>. You just have to hold onto him with two hands!
