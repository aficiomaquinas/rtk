1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 11-4-2007(140): The pirate with the <em>wooden leg</em> chased after the <em>parade float</em> and was run over by the next one, leaving<strong> tread</strong> marks all over him and his leg.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 19-12-2007(122): Pirates must<strong> tread</strong> carefully when walking on <em>parade floats</em>, so as not to break through the weak plaster with their <em>wooden legs</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christoph">Christoph</a>] 14-2-2007(50): Did Jesus actually<strong> tread</strong> on water? or maybe his <em>wooden leg</em> just allowed him to <em>float</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zz_alex_zz">zz_alex_zz</a>] 18-2-2008(14): At our natsu-matsuri they fixed auto-powered moving <em>wooden leg</em>s to the <em>parade float</em>. It looked like a big festival insect and it was all great until it started going crazy and began to <strong>tread</strong> on all the little Japanese kids... I can still hear them screaming in terror.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 31-3-2006(11): Note: I am playing on the meaning of the keyword in order to remember it through a more graphic image. Someone dressed like a pirate (<em>wooden leg</em>) comes down from the pirate-themed <em>float</em> (a vehicle in a carnival), to check the<strong> tread</strong> on the tyres. The actual keyword meaning is a verb (i.e. &quot;to trample&quot;, &quot;to carry through&quot;).
