The<strong> Beach</strong> Boys just had a concert down at the<strong> beach</strong>, and they&#039;re all wet after the performance. It&#039;s not <em>dry</em> enough down at the<strong> beach</strong> so they climb the nearest <em>cliff</em>. Still, it&#039;s not <em>dry</em> enough there so they climb the nearest <em>mountain</em>. Finally, the air seems <em>dry</em> and they take a rest while their clothes <em>dry</em>.
