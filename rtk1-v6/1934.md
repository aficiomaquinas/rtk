heisig: "<i>Salad</i> . . . <i>animal legs</i>."
primit: "The primitive retains the meaning of together. Imagine things strung together like fish on a line, beads on a thread, or whatever. The main thing is to avoid putting them in a straight row, which would confound this element with the previous one. As we saw with bushel basket, this primitive can join its legs to the final horizontal stroke and stretch them to form an enclosure."
