heisig: "Here is the character for <b>character</b> itself. Not just kanji, but any written <b>character</b> from hieroglyphs to Sanskrit to our own Roman alphabet. It shows us simply a <i>child</i> in a <i>house</i>. But let us take advantage of the double-meaning of the key word to note that just as a <i>child</i> born to a Japanese <i>house</i> is given <b>characters</b> for its name, so it is also stamped with the <b>character</b> of those who raise it from infancy on."

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/axelb">axelb</a>] 19-3-2008(53): The first kanji<strong> character</strong>s you will learn in Japan is probably learnt at home (in the <em>house</em> of your family) when you are still a <em>child</em>. Imagine a really small preschool child doing this (to prevent confusing house with school like in <a href="../v4/324.html">study</a> (#324 学)).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 30-4-2009(22): The way a child grows up in his house determines his<strong> character</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/applesuki">applesuki</a>] 15-2-2006(19): Imagine a child in his home (under the roof) sitting at the kitchen table practicing his kanji<strong> character</strong>s.
