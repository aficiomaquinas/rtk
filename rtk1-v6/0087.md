heisig: "Although this character no longer looks very much like a <b>sword</b>, it does have some resemblance to the handle of the <b>sword</b>. This is to our advantage, in that it helps us keep make a distinction between two primitive elements based on this kanji."
commen: "* In the form of the kanji, this primitive means a <i>dagger</i>. When it appears to the right of another element, it is commonly stretched out and takes the sense of a great and flashing <i>saber</i>, a meaning it gets from a character we shall learn later (Frame 1801)."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 15-8-2008(134): This<strong> SWORD</strong> is so sharp, it can cut the top part of カ off in カタナ.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mrcool">mrcool</a>] 22-5-2008(47): If you look really close this kanji looks like a person bending over touching the ground Waiting for someone to put there<strong> sword</strong> in his ass!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saturnine13">saturnine13</a>] 3-9-2009(44): Samurai carry two<strong> sword</strong>s on their belt: a curved katana and a straighter, shorter wakizashi.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snifty">snifty</a>] 17-2-2009(15): Looks like the handle on a pirate cutlass, a kind of<strong> sword</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 6-1-2006(14): Note : this is the kanji for the famous Japanese<strong> sword</strong>, also pronounced かたな (katana). As a primitive when it is compressed on the right of a kanji, its meaning becomes &quot;saber&quot;. In that case I like to associate the image of a ninja, making sure to keep it distinct from the &quot;samurai&quot;. The samurai would be the historical japanese warrior, while the ninja would be the more stealthy character popularised through modern martial arts movies.
