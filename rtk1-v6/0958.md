primit: "wheat This primitive element will be made to stand for wheat. It connotes a special grain, more expensive than ordinary rice and so reserved for special occasions. Alternatively, it can mean cereal. Its form is like that for tree, except for the dot at the top to represent a spike of wheat blowing in the wind. [5]"
