1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 18-2-2008(196): Suggestion: Replace &quot;spool&quot; with &quot;toilet paper/roll&quot;. Reasons: (1) <em>Toilet paper/roll</em> usually comes on a <em>spool</em>. (2) <em>Toilet paper</em> is used to clean the <em>soil</em> off your <em>crotch</em>. Story: Just get a <em>flower</em> and carefully wrap some <em>toilet paper</em> around its<strong> stalk</strong>. Spool also appears in <a href="../v4/716">suspicious</a> (#716 怪), <a href="../v4/717">lightly</a> (#717 軽), <a href="../v4/882">diameter</a> (#882 径), <a href="../v4/1360">sutra</a> (#1360 経).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 9-8-2007(130): PRIMITIVE: <em>soiled crotch</em> = <em>soiled underwear</em>. To precent anyone from picking the beautiful <em>flower</em>, the gardner hung <em>soiled underwear</em> on the <strong>stalk</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nac_est">nac_est</a>] 24-7-2007(83): A <em>flower</em>&#039;s<strong> stalk</strong> can be seen as connecting the <em>flower</em> to the <em>soil</em>, <em>or again</em> the <em>soil</em> to the <em>flower</em>. It depends on how you look at it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 15-10-2010(62): Jack and the Bean<strong>stalk</strong>: <em>dirt</em> below, <em>flowers</em> above, and Jack&#039;s <em>crotch</em> visible as he climbs up and up. 茎 (くき) :<strong> stalk</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 16-9-2007(30): Flowering vines growing up a post or column. The<strong> stalk</strong>s wrap around the post-- again and again-- like a <em>spool </em>of thread, and <em>flowers</em> bloom at the very top. At the bottom, of course, is the soil.
