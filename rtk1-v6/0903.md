1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 9-8-2007(189): The Simpsons are on vacation. <em>Homer</em> stops to take a leak in a <strong>mountain stream</strong> but gets snatched by an <em>eagle</em>. Hear his scream?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-4-2006(92): A husband who went fishing at the<strong> mountain stream</strong> to feed his family, fell in the rapids (we&#039;ll assume this is a large<strong> mountain stream</strong>). He is saved from the waters by a great eagle. He comes back home with nothing to feed the family, his clothes still dripping wet as he tells his wife of how he was saved by a great eagle, and of course she does not believe him. The story continues in <a href="../v4/1947.html">chicken</a> (#1947 鶏).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 3-3-2008(46): The water from the<strong> mountain stream</strong> saved my husband from thirst, dehydration and the vultures.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 22-5-2012(23): The <em>water</em> from the<strong> mountain stream</strong> saved the <em>husband</em> from <em>vultures</em> (see <a href="../v4/1947.html">chicken</a> (#1947 鶏) for another example of vulture over husband).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 31-12-2006(19): Did you ever wonder where the <em>water</em> in<strong> mountain stream</strong>s came from? It comes from <em>vultures</em> peeing. Anyone knowing the anatomical and temperamental differences between the sexes will also realize that the <em>water</em> comes from the <em>vulture</em> <em>husbands</em>.
