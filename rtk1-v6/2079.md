1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dragg">Dragg</a>] 22-3-2008(236): George W. Bush&#039;s plans for<strong> war</strong> were so SIMPLE. To him, its all just a big FIESTA.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 19-1-2009(71): What started out as a <em>simple fiesta</em>, turned into a full-scale<strong> war</strong> after arguments about whose potato salad was the best.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 6-1-2006(27): <em>Simple-minded blond girl</em> (see previous frame) is going to a <em>fiesta</em>, and boy... is this<strong> war</strong> ! She may be simple-minded but she could easily have written The Art of<strong> War</strong>. Only, the woman&#039;s version. She has just arrived at the fiesta, she has quickly apprehended the battlefield, taking note of the other competing girls who may pose a threat, and where the good looking guys are. Just watch her dividing the girls, and conquering the boys. I told you, this is<strong> war</strong> !
