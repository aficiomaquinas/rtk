heisig: "One often thinks of books as &quot;good <i>companions</i>,&quot; but here it is the <b>shelf</b> we store them on that is the <i>companion</i>. The reasons should be obvious: it is made of the same stuff, <i>wood</i>, and spends a lot more time with them than we do! Here again, be careful not to let the rationality of the explanation get in the way before you turn it into a proper story."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977">mameha1977</a>] 11-10-2007(247): A<strong> shelf</strong> is a <em>wooden companion</em> to books.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TaylorSan">TaylorSan</a>] 2-3-2009(75): I think of an Otaku, with a <em>wooden</em><strong> shelf</strong> full of anime action figure statures, who are sadly his only <em>companions</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/komodo">komodo</a>] 17-6-2008(28): My ideal <em>companion</em> would have an ass I could use as a<strong> shelf</strong>. Just look at those two <em>flesh</em>y hemispheres. The association of <em>wood</em> should come easily.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joxn_costello">joxn_costello</a>] 22-11-2008(14): A<strong> shelf</strong> is made out of <em>wood</em>, and it is a <em>companion</em> to books. But most importantly for me, the <em>two moons</em> look like the spines of hardbound books standing next to one another as <em>companions</em> on a<strong> shelf</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(7): A <em>wooden</em> <strong>shelf</strong> is the perfect <em>companion</em> to all my lovely books!
