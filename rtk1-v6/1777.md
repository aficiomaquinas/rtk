heisig: "It is best to see this kanji as a pictograph of a revolving circular clothesline (viewed from the side). Spin it around quickly in your mind's eye to give it the connotation of to <b>dry</b>."
commen: "* The primitive meaning is <i>clothesline</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomusan">tomusan</a>] 23-4-2008(168): <strong>Dry</strong> <em>one</em> item in <em>ten</em> minutes on the <em>clothesline</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brose">brose</a>] 17-2-2007(57): Note: the book shows the strokes for <em>potato</em> rather than<strong> dry</strong>...dry does not have the hook at the end.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 26-1-2010(31): <em>Vampire</em>: Upside down samurai. They suck humans<strong> dry</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-9-2008(15): A<strong> dry</strong> <em>water lily</em> with no <em>drops</em> on it (see <a href="../v4/1484">even</a> (#1484 平).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 21-9-2006(14): Heisig&#039;s pictograph of a <em>clothesline</em> is fine, but I also see another pictograph here, that of <em>one</em> <em>needle</em> trying to push its way through the<strong> dry</strong> <em>surface of the earth</em> above it but because of a lack of rain the earth is parched and<strong> dry</strong> thus this <em>one</em> <em>needle</em> stays buried in the earth below. Furthermore, you could say that the earth is so<strong> dry</strong> that there&#039;s not even <em>one needle</em> left on it.
