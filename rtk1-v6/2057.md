1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-4-2007(172): Mrs. Badger follows the <em>animal tracks</em> to the den where she finds her husband getting a <em>blowjob</em> from a fox. &quot;I have a good <strong>explanation</strong> for this. Really!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 14-10-2009(103): <strong>Animal track</strong> primitive: As expected, <strong>animal tracks</strong> were left in place of the trail of <em>rice</em> I&#039;d purposely <em>drop</em>ped the night before. EDIT - also try <strong>the footprint</strong> for a primitive meaning, the classic symbol of detective films. STORY: This <em>shakuhachi</em> player is so talented, he can do<strong> interpretation</strong>s of animal noises too. They&#039;re so realistic he soon has <em>animal tracks</em> leading straight to wherever he&#039;s playing.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 4-1-2007(65): The magical shakuhachi can easily give explanation for any animal tracks, just like it can be used to translate words ( 訳 ).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 22-6-2008(40): Mrs. Badger follows the <em>animal tracks</em> to the den where she finds her husband getting <em>shakuhachi</em> from a fox. Now, I don&#039;t speak badger but judging from the screeching and the gestures, my<strong> interpretation</strong> of the situation is that Mrs. Badger is not pleased. (thanks dingomick! Just trying to use this new keyword).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/furrykef">furrykef</a>] 5-7-2008(17): An <strong>interpretive</strong> dance of some kind where somebody follows <em>animal tracks</em>, a <em>shakuhachi</em> providing the soundtrack, suggesting the tracker&#039;s thoughts and intentions.
