heisig: "With the advice of the last frame in mind, it is easy to see <i>water</i> and <i>meadow</i> in this character for <b>source</b>. Both in its etymology (it has a common parent with the word &quot;surge&quot;) and in popular usage, <b>source</b> suggests the place <i>water</i> comes from. In this kanji, it is under the <i>meadow</i>, where we just saw it breaking the surface in those bubbly little <i>springs</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dogen2">dogen2</a>] 17-3-2007(146): The <em>water</em> that flows from the <em>meadow</em> is the <strong>source</strong> of life for the wild antelope.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 14-8-2006(74): The<strong> source</strong> of clean <em>water</em> is from the <a href="../v4/134">meadow</a> (#134 原): it comes from that <em>spring</em> at the bottom of the <em>cliff</em>. Pay no attention to Julie Andrews lying face down in <em>spring</em>. The water&#039;s clean. Trust me.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mdspencer">mdspencer</a>] 11-2-2009(65): <em>Water</em> is the<strong> source</strong> of a <em>meadow</em>&#039;s beauty.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 11-11-2007(31): Here the<strong> SOURCE</strong> of water is deep beneath the ground (<em>cliff</em>) - it seeps up, joins the water <em>springs</em>, flows through the meadow, and down the waterfall at the end. (NOTE- to keep <strong>spring</strong> (133) and<strong> source</strong> separate, remember that a spring can be anywhere above ground; but the<strong> source</strong> of water is deep beneath the ground (<em>cliff</em>), and flows up through the ground to join springs and streams - which is why there are two primitives for <em>water</em> in this kanji).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 20-5-2007(23): Bottled <em>water</em> companies assure us that the<strong> source</strong> of their water is from some beautiful <em>meadow</em>-spring in the Swiss Alps, but we all know they just bottle up tap water.
