1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 2-11-2005(158): This represents a<strong> stern</strong> looking owl, perched up on a cliff. This cliff is quite famous for daring individuals to cliff dive off of, but is any of them daring enough to threaten the owl?

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 9-3-2008(70): ( 厳しい strict;<strong> stern</strong> ) You remember of course the daring fella who had his ear pierced and went standing in front of the taskmaster. The taskmasters punishment was very<strong> stern</strong>/strict. Fella thrown of the cliff, where the owls are ready to feast. No funny guy doing that anymore.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku">genbaku</a>] 22-1-2008(29): The owl gives a<strong> stern</strong> warning to any animal that dare pass under the cliff.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zanzibar">zanzibar</a>] 3-5-2009(11): The<strong> stern</strong> OWL parent throws his young off the CLIFF to test their DARING.
