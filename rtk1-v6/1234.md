1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 7-2-2008(252): In high society, a<strong> lady</strong> is a <em>woman</em> who never touches a <em>broom</em> or an <em>apron</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 8-10-2007(114): The<strong> LADY</strong> of the house is nothing more than a WOMAN who&#039;s a HOUSEWIFE (BROOM and APRON anyone?).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 29-6-2007(29): Im a laaaaidy! (little britain) - heres the old fashioned woman with her apron on beating a man up with a broom because he made an ungentleman like advancement on her.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 9-9-2007(18): The French maid is the ideal<strong> lady</strong> -- here&#039;s a <em>woman</em> that comes to your house dressed in an <em>apron</em> and carrying a <em>broom</em>. To enforce the position of the primitives, make this a particularly kinky maid that is wearing just the <em>apron</em> below her waist, and using the <em>broom</em> to cover her breasts.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KeroHazel">KeroHazel</a>] 18-6-2009(11): The <em>French maid</em> modestly covers her crotch with a <em>towel</em> when she enters the <em>women</em>s&#039; bath. As dirty as she may be in her private life, in public she is a perfect<strong> lady</strong>.
