primit: "owl We have already met these three strokes before. When they come under another stroke, they represent a claw, and thence a vulture. And when placed atop a roof structure, they create a schoolhouse. The owl has something to do with both: it is a bird of prey, and it has come to be associated in the popular imagination with learning. [3]"
heisig: "Owl . . . fruit."
