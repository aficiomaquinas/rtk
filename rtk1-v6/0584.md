2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 27-1-2008(86): Don&#039;t confuse with <a href="../v4/1127.html">place</a> (#1127 所). Think of<strong> location</strong> not as a single fixed spot, but as the act of locating. You&#039;ve buried your <em>piggy bank</em> in the <em>dirt</em> in your backyard, but you can&#039;t remember where. You frantically dig everywhere in a process of<strong> location</strong> to find your piggy bank.
