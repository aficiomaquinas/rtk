1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 4-3-2007(282): With kids <em>growing up</em> in your <em>house</em>, you have to keep them from <strong>harm</strong> of putting anything in their <em>mouth</em>, paint chips, bleach, knvies, etc.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 26-12-2006(72): This is silly, but.. If a house suddenly grows up from your mouth, you will come to great<strong> harm</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Beneus">Beneus</a>] 19-1-2009(19): Babies think that there&#039;s no<strong> harm</strong> in putting stuff in their mouths, but you just know that one day they&#039;ll find a growth pill, eat it and crash through the roof of your house as they grow.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rowdyphantom">rowdyphantom</a>] 23-8-2009(14): In the <em>house</em>, whenever <em>Alice</em> opens her <em>mouth</em> (to eat or drink) she causes <strong>harm</strong> (by growing too big for the house).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 1-4-2008(14): <strong>Harm</strong> is being done all throughout the <em>house</em> that <em>Peter Pan</em> lives in. Him and all the lost boys are all putting things they aren&#039;t supposed to into their mouths! (thanks dingomick) I&#039;m going to call this the lost boys house.
