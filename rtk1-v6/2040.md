1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 2-12-2008(58): There is a certain restaurant in West-Shinjuku that serves its<strong> noodles</strong> made of BARLEY in a MASK instead of a plate. I love these theme-restaurants!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 3-2-2010(38): I always eat <em>barley</em><strong> noodles</strong> with a <em>mask</em> on - it stops them splashing in your face.

The most common use for this, Ramen, is actually written in Kana exclusively. The Kanji is used to talk about the<strong> noodles</strong> themselves before they are cooked into a dish. ... Story: How did <em>Chris Barley</em> get so fat? He lived near an all-you-can-eat <strong>Noodle</strong> shop (Ramen, Somen, etc.). Even after they banned him, he would just put on a mask and keep coming back. Richard Nixon mask? Check. Tony Blair Mask? No good, that mouth is too small.
