2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 5-11-2007(71): [from decamer0n] This is the kanji for atsui ( 暑い ) as in hot. If you&#039;ve ever been in Japan in the summer no doubt you have heard hoards of people bellowing &quot;Atsui! Atsui!&quot; Here you are laying with your <em>love doll</em> under the hot <em>sun.</em> Luckily the manufacturers were smart and when the doll got to hot it would bellow &quot;Atsui! It&#039;s so<strong> sultry</strong>!&quot;.
