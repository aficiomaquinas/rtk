heisig: "The elements <i>white bird</i> and <i>ladle</i> easily suggest the image of a <b>bull's eye</b> if you imagine a rusty old <i>ladle</i> with a <b>bull's eye</b> painted on it in the form of a tiny <i>white bird</i>, who lets out a little &quot;peep&quot; every time you hit the target."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 22-7-2007(223): I managed to hit the bull&#039;s eye by throwing my white ladle.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/seanolan">seanolan</a>] 10-10-2006(167): A <em>white</em>, <em>bound up</em>, <em>drop</em> in the center is the bull&#039;s eye. (why Heisig had to use &quot;ladle&quot; instead of the original two primitives that make up &quot;ladle&quot; I&#039;ll never understand!).

You lift the ladle to your lips. Right after you close your eyes to take a taste, a drop of white bird shit falls into the ladle - &quot; Bull&#039;s Eye! &quot; the bird says. Not seeing the incident, you proceed to taste your &#039;white sauce&#039;.
