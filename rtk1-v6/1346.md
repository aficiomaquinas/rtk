1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 10-5-2007(214): I had a hard time with the next several frame numbers trying to use &quot;puppet.&quot; So i thought of &quot;voodoo doll&quot; but then found &quot;love doll&quot; (which is just a special type of puppet) fit well with these 8 frames. Observe: Here I am<strong> boil</strong>ing my <em>love doll</em> over the <em>flames</em> to warm her up a bit...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 31-5-2006(68): There is a lesser known voodoo practice of<strong> boil</strong>ing a <em>puppet</em> over an <em>oven fire</em>, to really make your victim feel the heat!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 25-5-2008(49): Instead of puppet I like to think of &quot;someone&quot; as ninja (since it is the second kanji in ninja)- it made me think of some interesting stories. First up: A <strong>ninja</strong> must be able to walk over <strong>fire</strong> without his blood<strong> boil</strong>ing. (see him walking across the stretch of fire in concentration).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 20-5-2009(32): I<strong> boil</strong> my <em>love doll</em> (thanks decamer0n) over <em>oven fire</em> to disinfect her because somebody might have &quot;used&quot; her before...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 17-12-2007(18): Instead of puppet, I use Chucky. <em>Chucky</em> is being<strong> boil</strong>ed to death over a <em>fire</em> at the end of one of the movies.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 17-5-2008(8): Evil Gepetto suspends his puppet above hearth fire, bringing Pinnochio&#039;s blood to a<strong> boil</strong> -- in more ways than one.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 13-12-2007(7): Oh, no! <em>Pinnochio</em> is being<strong> boil</strong>ed over a <em>cooking fire</em> to make soup!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wazato">wazato</a>] 3-11-2007(7): I have to<strong> boil</strong> my love doll over the open flames to sterilize her...

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 2-6-2009(6): The first form of torture the <em>ninja</em> had to endure was being dunked in <em>fire</em>-heated<strong> boil</strong>ing water (continued in <a href="../v4/1259">signature</a> (#1259 署).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Floatingweed5">Floatingweed5</a>] 8-10-2007(5): The replicant love puppet can very easily endure<strong> boil</strong>ing temperatures. In the film Blade Runner, Roy Batty placed his hand in some<strong> boil</strong>ing water. In this Kanji the Replicant Love Doll is having a deep cleansing bath over a hot oven fire.
