primit: "silage The drawing of this element is difficult to do smoothly, and should be practiced carefully. It is a pictograph of all sorts of plants and grasses thrown together to make silage. The vertical stroke is drawn here with a broken line to indicate that it will always double up with another primitive element’s vertical stroke. [6]"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 27-6-2006(178): The Queen of England taking a walk round a village: &#039;Excuse me, I couldn&#039;t help noticing the <strong>splendour</strong> of the <em>flowers</em> in your garden. Simply splendid. <em>Ten</em> out of ten.&#039; The villager gruffly replies: &#039;No it &#039;aint. It&#039;s all muck. An&#039; I&#039;m gonna cut it all down and sell it to the farmer for <em>silage</em>.&#039;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 21-11-2007(149): Hint:<strong> Splendor</strong> in the Grass. Compare with 草 . This is just a more <strong>splendid</strong> version of that kanji.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 6-7-2008(50): In all its<strong> splendor</strong> a delicate flower arose from the pile of silage on a single needle-think stem.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 28-7-2009(36): I couldn&#039;t find the <em>needle</em> in the heap of <em>silage</em> but was surprised to find a <em>flower</em> of great<strong> splendor</strong> growing there.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 27-12-2008(21): The tourist marvels at the<strong> splendor</strong> of the jungle <em>flowers</em>. Little does she know, the <em>crosshair</em> of a <em>needle</em>-gun is pointing right at her. (As a primitive <em>silage</em> can take the meaning &#039;<strong>crosshair</strong>&#039;... for blindingly obvious reasons).
