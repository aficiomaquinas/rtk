heisig: "Flower . . . silage . . . needle."
primit: "silage The drawing of this element is difficult to do smoothly, and should be practiced carefully. It is a pictograph of all sorts of plants and grasses thrown together to make silage. The vertical stroke is drawn here with a broken line to indicate that it will always double up with another primitive element’s vertical stroke. [6]"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 27-6-2006(178): The Queen of England taking a walk round a village: &#039;Excuse me, I couldn&#039;t help noticing the <strong>splendour</strong> of the <em>flowers</em> in your garden. Simply splendid. <em>Ten</em> out of ten.&#039; The villager gruffly replies: &#039;No it &#039;aint. It&#039;s all muck. An&#039; I&#039;m gonna cut it all down and sell it to the farmer for <em>silage</em>.&#039;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 21-11-2007(149): Hint:<strong> Splendor</strong> in the Grass. Compare with 草 . This is just a more <strong>splendid</strong> version of that kanji.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 6-7-2008(50): In all its<strong> splendor</strong> a delicate flower arose from the pile of silage on a single needle-think stem.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 27-12-2008(21): The tourist marvels at the<strong> splendor</strong> of the jungle <em>flowers</em>. Little does she know, the <em>crosshair</em> of a <em>needle</em>-gun is pointing right at her. (As a primitive <em>silage</em> can take the meaning &#039;<strong>crosshair</strong>&#039;... for blindingly obvious reasons).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lernsky">lernsky</a>] 5-5-2013(14): Easy to remember by alternating stroke order: (-)(|): <strong>1-2-2-2-2-1</strong>. Start with a <strong>splendid</strong> <em>flower</em> primitive and just finish, <strong>splendidly</strong> preserving symmetry in every regard - and you&#039;ll get a real splendid flower below.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andresito">andresito</a>] 17-5-2009(12): <strong>NEW primitive; radar</strong>. Our digital camera has a <em>radar</em> as fine as a <em>cross needle</em> to capture the<strong> splendor</strong> from a <em>flower</em>.

See the<strong> splendor</strong> of the <em>roses</em> filling the <em>greenhouse</em>, beauty atop a stem of <em>needles</em> (thorns).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KristinHolly">KristinHolly</a>] 17-12-2008(6): Grass often has little flowers. That&#039;s just ordinary grass. But if you use silage as mulch, you can help the flowers grow to their full<strong> splendor</strong>. Hint:<strong> Splendor</strong> in the Grass. Compare with 草 . This is just a more <strong>splendid</strong> version of that kanji. (from FudoMyo).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 12-3-2006(6): Silage is a huge round silage tank like the ones industrial sized pig farms have today.
