heisig: "On the left you see the <i>rock</i>, which is familiar enough. But pay attention to the right. Taking careful note of the unusual stroke order that has the &quot;chimney&quot; on the <i>house</i> doubled up with the first stroke of the <i>turkey</i>, we may see the right side as a <i>turkey house</i> (or &quot;<i>coop</i>&quot;).
We shall see this pattern only on one other occasion (Frame 2093), but even for these two characters it is well worth the trouble to single it out as a primitive."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 30-8-2007(260): To assure that no one will get into the Turkey coop, put a huge rock in the entrance!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 5-12-2008(129): You&#039;ve heard the expression &quot;killing two birds with one stone.&quot; ( 一石二鳥 <em>is-seki-ni-chou</em>). We&#039;ll, there&#039;s another one that roughly translates as &quot;killing an entire coop with a giant boulder. &quot; That&#039;s the method that hunters use when they want absolute<strong> assurance</strong> of taking home a bird.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/protput">protput</a>] 20-3-2009(42): I <strong>assure</strong> you, the <em>rock</em> is big enough to keep the <em>turkey</em> inside the <em>house</em>. And if that&#039;s not enuff, I&#039;ll tie the tail of the <em>turkey</em> to the chimney.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zardoz73">zardoz73</a>] 29-8-2008(22): I assure you, I promise a thousand times over--this rock will be strong enough to keep the killer turkeys inside their turkey house. Stop worrying, I assure you this will work!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 16-5-2008(12): If you use <em>stone</em> to build your <em>turkey house</em>, you will have a much better<strong> assurance</strong> that it will last longer.
