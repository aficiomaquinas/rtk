1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 14-8-2007(191): Right part: <em>academic conference</em> (a <em>meeting</em>, some of the attendees making notes in <em>scrapbooks</em> during presentation). <strong>Argument</strong> at <em>academic conferences</em> is naturally carried out using <em>words</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 15-10-2006(67): It&#039;s very difficult to present a good<strong> argument</strong> if you don&#039;t bring along a <em>scrapbook</em> with some key <em>words</em> jotted down to the <em>meeting</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256">cjon256</a>] 22-1-2010(35): <em>Words</em> must he chosen <em>methodically</em> to make a good<strong> argument</strong>. Note: 侖 <a href="../v4/20374">Unicode-0x4f96</a> (#20374 侖) is an extremely rare kanji meaning &quot;methodical&quot;, I remember this with: &quot;A meeting of scrapbookers who are very methodical.&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 17-6-2008(24): For <em>scrapbook</em> I used the image of a Panini sticker album, and thus the <em>meeting of scrapbooks</em> becomes a &quot;Panini sticker album convention&quot; (like a comics-con, only with collectors of Panini sticker albums). Pretty much all the <em>words</em> you can hear at the <em>scrapbook meeting</em> are<strong> argument</strong>s between geeks about which album is better.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/igordesu">igordesu</a>] 6-3-2009(22): Picture a bunch of ladies at a scrapbook convention engaging in a heated debate/argument with their words. &quot;You call that a scrapbook!&quot; &quot;Psh! Puh-lease! You ain&#039;t got the first thing about a scrapbook!&quot; &quot;That ain&#039;t no scrapbook! That&#039;s a crapbook!&quot;.
