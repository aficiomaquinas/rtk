heisig: "The abbreviation of <b>Building</b> suggests that this kanji is used in proper names, as indeed it often is. Keep your connotation distinct from <i>Inst.</i> (Frame 1401) when working with the elements: <i>food</i> . . . <i>bureaucrat</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 24-2-2008(211): A <strong>building</strong> that <em>eats</em> <em>bureaucrats</em>!!!!!!!!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 17-6-2006(163): This<strong> Bldg.</strong> is like all the other government buildings - they house <em>bureaucrats</em> who sit around sipping wine and <em>eating</em> expensive meals at the taxpayers expense.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 25-9-2008(40): The <em>bureaucrat</em> never goes out for lunch, always choosing to <em>eat</em> in the<strong> Bldg.</strong>

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jamestaverner">jamestaverner</a>] 21-2-2008(15): Empire State <strong>Building</strong> (to avoid confusing with <a href="../v4/591">government office</a> (#591 庁) and <a href="../v4/1304">Inst.</a> (#1304 院)). <em>McDonalds</em> lobbies the <em>bureaucrats</em> by treating them to a lavish feast at the top of the Empire State <strong>Building</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BlackMarsh">BlackMarsh</a>] 8-1-2006(11): As this is a type of abbreviation you can assume that the building type is that of a government organisation. And we all know the type of people found in these &quot;bldgs&quot; - fat bureaucrats who have eaten too much food.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 11-4-2010(7): <em>food</em> is served only in<strong> Bldg.</strong> 1478 said the <em>bureaucrat</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KanjiVirtuoso">KanjiVirtuoso</a>] 4-1-2013(5): One can be forgiven for thinking that the Food<strong> Bldg.</strong> (i.e. the cafeteria) <em>eats</em> <em>bureaucrats</em>; they go in those sliding doors but never seem to come back out.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shuusaku">shuusaku</a>] 1-2-2010(5): I do not really understand why, but you are not allowed to EAT inside that<strong> BLDG.</strong>! I&#039;d really like to meet the stupid BUREAUCRAT who came up with such a stupid rule!

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kioku3">kioku3</a>] 12-4-2009(5): The Empire State<strong> Bldg.</strong> has a new cannibal food court--you can <em>eat</em> grilled and marinated <em>bureaucrat</em> there in season. It&#039;s not in the tourist guidebooks yet but locals love it! (thanx jamestaverner).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Norman">Norman</a>] 27-1-2013(3): <em>Bureaucrats</em> are busy, so they often <em>Eat</em> next to the<strong> Bldg.</strong> they work at.
