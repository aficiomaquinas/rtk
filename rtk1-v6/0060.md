1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 12-11-2008(43): Fortune teller writes your fortune on a piece of paper and tells you to<strong> affix</strong> it to a shell and throw into the ocean for it to come true.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 7-5-2010(25): To prevent confusion with <a href="../v4/1303">affixed</a> (#1303 附) I changed this to &quot;paste (v.)&quot; or &quot;cut and paste&quot; because it is the character for pasting in a PC and in graphic design. Careful <a href="../v4/2650">paste</a> (#2650 糊) Story: You pay money and the fortune teller cuts and pastes a good fortune and prints it out for you on his notebook PC. 切り貼り きりはり cut and paste, 貼る はる to stick/to paste, 貼付け はりつけ (computer file) paste.
