heisig: "With a bit of stretching, you might see a horse's head pointing leftwards in this character. That gives the primary meaning of the Chinese zodiacal sign of the horse, which corresponds to the hour of <b>noon</b>. Note how this kanji primitive differs from that for <i>cow</i> (Frame 260)."
commen: "* As a primitive, this character gets the meaning of a <i>horse</i>. Any <i>horse</i> image will do, except that of a <i>team of horses</i>, which will come later (Frame 2132) and get its own primitive."
