1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 6-4-2007(189): A <strong>ghost</strong>, or <strong>oni</strong>, wandering slowly on its <em>human legs</em>, searching for <em>brains</em> to eat. What looks like an <em>elbow</em> here is actually a pictoral representation of the <em>forked tail</em> protruding out of its rear.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 18-11-2006(95): <strong>Ghost</strong>s aren&#039;t very intelligent - they have but a <em>drop</em> of <em>brains</em> - so can&#039;t tell the difference between an <em>elbow</em> and a pair of <em>human legs</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 7-11-2007(69): Building on Matthew&#039;s excellent image, the <em>drop</em> can be the single horn sticking out of the <strong>oni</strong>&#039;s forehead.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 8-1-2007(49): 鬼 (おに) is not a<strong> ghost</strong>. An ogre or a troll would be a more fitting translation. Such a thing has but a drop of brains and uses its legs and elbows as deadly weapons (a concept which should be familiar from the <a href="../v4/765">license</a> (#765 允) to kill). I&#039;ll use &quot;ogre&quot; for this.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 3-11-2008(22): This<strong> ghost</strong> had only a <em>drop of brains</em>, his <em>legs</em> and <em>elbow</em> were easily visible from under his sheet.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 14-1-2006(14): To keep an image distinct from that of &quot;spirits&quot; (frame 1791), I imagine green<strong> ghost</strong>s, as in the movie &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. Only here, they take over humans : they shrink to the size of a <em>drop</em>, enter in the person&#039;s <em>brain</em>, then try to control the person&#039;s <em>human legs</em>. But because of the similarity with the <em>elbows</em> (both are articulated in the middle), the<strong> ghost</strong>s sometimes get confused and move the <em>elbows</em> instead. People possessed by these<strong> ghost</strong>s walk really funny.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hoticehunter">Hoticehunter</a>] 17-3-2012(6): This is oni: Ogre, demon.<strong> Ghost</strong> is yurei ( 幽霊 ). This is not<strong> ghost</strong>. Change the keyword to something else if you want to learn a correct keyword.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber">uberclimber</a>] 14-10-2010(5): A <strong>ghost</strong>, or <strong>oni</strong>, has a single horn sticking out of the its forehead (the <em>drop</em>) and carries a huge club in the crook of its <em>elbow</em>. It wanders on its <em>human legs</em>, searching for skulls to smash open and <em>brains</em> to devour. 鬼 (おに) : ogre, demon.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ericjurotich">ericjurotich</a>] 9-1-2010(5): If that<strong> ghost</strong> had even a drop of brains, he would get that elbow removed from his left leg.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 28-4-2009(3): This<strong> ghost</strong> is actually a demon (おに) that entered a human brain and lodged like a parasite (the little elbow) in a human soul. The possessed human drifts around like a<strong> ghost</strong>.
