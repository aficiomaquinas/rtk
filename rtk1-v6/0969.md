Now, Imagine the husband (the &#039;head&#039; of the household, the farmer and what not). Walking across his farm, then in a regular, ordered, and systemised fashion he DROPS (the drop) a little piece of wheat. I love this image not only because it answers the keyword, but it is really close to the meaning of the actual kanji.
