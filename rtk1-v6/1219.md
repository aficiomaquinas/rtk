1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 26-2-2007(243): What is this <strong>substance</strong> on this <em>clam</em>? I&#039;ve already broken 2 <em>axes</em> on it! (Good <strong>question</strong>... 質問 ).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 5-1-2008(85): Another keyword that I do not like by Heisig. 質 【しつ】 (n,n-suf) quality. Story: Your at a local ax dealer and you have TWO AXES which you are testing for QUALITY by trying to split CLAMS right down the opening. Picture yourself succeeding with one AX and then some weird<strong> SUBSTANCE</strong> comes out of the shell...eww (I don&#039;t like clams).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster">snallygaster</a>] 1-10-2007(48): [seems to mean &quot;substance&quot; in the sense of essential nature or core quality, most common usage might be 質問 , shitsumon (inquiry)] a pair of scientists are smashing away at a mysterious <strong>shell</strong> with <strong>axes</strong>, pounding it into powder so they can feed it into their analysis machine and discover exactly what<strong> substance</strong> it&#039;s made up of.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 20-3-2008(26): This guy dealing in illegal<strong> substance</strong>s makes a lot of <em>shells</em> (money), but he&#039;s always equipped with his <em>dual-axe</em> ... it&#039;s a dangerous job.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 11-9-2007(14): The newest illegal<strong> substance</strong> on the streets is Shellinium. It&#039;s made of <em>shells</em> hacked to bits with <em>axes</em>. Imagine going to your local dealer to get it - you&#039;ve got to get past a huge <em>shell</em> mafia goon who is holding two <em>axes</em>...
