If you swipe 土 from 壊 <a href="../v4/400">demolition</a> (#400 壊), this kanji will replace the missing primitive with a <strong>yearning</strong> <em>state of mind</em> - one meaning for this kanji. Yearning is a state of mind close to the heart, contained in a breast<strong> pocket</strong> perhaps.
