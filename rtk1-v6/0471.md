heisig: "See the peddlar <i>standing</i> atop his <i>motorcycle helmet</i> as if it were a soapbox, hawking his wares to passersby. The <i>legs</i> and <i>mouth</i> represent the tools of the trade of <b>making a deal</b> any way you can."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize">samuize</a>] 21-2-2007(327): I use what I think is the real etymology for this kanji which is so shocking it sticks. The STANDING member at the top is a certain part of the body that all men have and it is approaching the HOLE between TWO LEGS (the HOOD) with extra marks to show they are FLESHY - ie a womans legs. So this shows the oldest DEAL of all time - prostitution.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 21-3-2006(86): Slick Willy standing on the motorcycle helmet he&#039;s trying to sell you to demonstrate how rugged it is. His legs crash through the top of it and after a moment of awkward silence his mouth opens and says, &quot;hey, we can still<strong> make a deal</strong>.&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dagur">Dagur</a>] 6-11-2008(76): <em>Four</em> loud<em>mouths</em> trying to<strong> make a deal</strong> on a <em>vase</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 10-3-2009(33): NOT a vase or stand up but actually represents a penis, as subtly pointed out by samuize. The kinky man goes to see the <em>hooded</em> prositute to<strong> make a deal</strong> involving his <em>penis</em> and her <em>legs</em> and <em>mouth</em>). Apologies for the rudeness, but that&#039;s what it&#039;s about.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 31-7-2008(21): At the beginning of <strong>Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi</strong>, Luke Skywalker is <em>standing</em> at the edge of a giant sand pit, awaiting to to be consumed by the Sarlacc, a giant ant lion-like creature that lives in the pit. While Luke is standing there, <em>legs</em> dangling over the huge mouth of the creature, he makes a last plea with Jabba the Hut to<strong> make a deal</strong>, but Jabba only laughs.
