heisig: "When a manufacturer produces a new <i>style</i> for the market, the first thing that is done is to run a <b>test</b> on consumers, asking them to <i>speak</i> their opinions frankly about the product. Never mind the anachronism (the kanji was there well before our capitalistic market system) if it helps you remember."
