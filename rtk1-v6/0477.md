heisig: "Recall some particularly harsh <b>scolding</b>&nbsp;you got as a child in school. This character has you <i>sitting on the ground</i>&nbsp;in the corner as your teacher stands over you, her <i>mouth</i>&nbsp;wide open as she reprimands you in front of the entire class."

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paasan">paasan</a>] 5-7-2010(12): Here&#039;s a story I read many years ago in a magazine. It was about a girl who was lonely and wanting and decided to play with a banana. While doing this, she suddenly heard her parents returning home, and being startled, the banana broke inside her. Her mom then had to use a spoon to get the banana out of this poor girl while she was being <strong>scolded</strong>. So actually, this is a pictograph..

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 11-11-2010(5): This is NOT spoon. The first stroke of the RHS goes beyond the second stroke. It&#039;s diced. STORY: When I try to make dinner, my wife<strong> scold</strong>s me because of my poor dicing technique. &quot;This is too big! It will never fit in our mouths! Dice it again!&quot;.
