4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 22-9-2006(29): [signature; govt office; police station] <strong>Signature</strong>? Forget it!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 29-7-2006(22): The character also means &quot;public-service office or station&quot; (tax office, police station, ...). I&#039;ll use this to distinguish the kanji from other keywords like &quot;inscription&quot; that suggest a written name. Here I have a public-service station where residents can get a new<strong> signature</strong>, in calligraphy form. There are two sizes : big and small. The big one is made by the <em>cyclops</em>, and the small one by the <em>puppet</em>. So that&#039;s where you find this unlikely duo: at the<strong> signature</strong> public-service station.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 5-1-2010(6): <em>Chucky</em> has a phobia of pens so his<strong> signature</strong> is unique. He pokes someone&#039;s <em>eye</em> out and uses the flowing blood to write &quot;Chucky&quot; I wonder if the mortgage agency will find that<strong> signature</strong> acceptable.
