1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 18-11-2007(90): Something that is<strong> obscure</strong> has <em>not yet</em> been brought before the light of <em>day</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 11-1-2009(48): &#039;Can&#039;t you go outside and get some <em>sun</em>?&#039; &#039;<em>Not yet</em>, I have to learn all these <strong>obscure</strong> RTK3 kanji!&#039;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(10): Things look<strong> obscure</strong> when the <em>sun</em> is <em>not yet</em> out.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 11-11-2010(6): Unlike us, some people finish RTK 1 and think &quot;Should I learn all those<strong> obscure</strong> kanji in RTK 3? Nah, NOT YET. I&#039;ll learn them some other DAY.&quot; We&#039;re just extra Kanji sadistic. (Although, I should say, this kanji is not very<strong> obscure</strong>. 曖昧 is in the vocab list for JLPT level 2).
