heisig: "In a <b>riot</b>, manners are laid aside and tempers get short, even in so courtesy-conscious a land as Japan. This kanji shows what happens to a <b>rioting</b> <i>tongue</i>: it gets &quot;barbed&quot; like a <i>fishhook</i>, and sets to attacking the opposition, to <i>hook</i> them as it were."
