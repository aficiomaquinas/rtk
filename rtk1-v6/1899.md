primit: "bushel basket As the two legs at the bottom suggest, this bushel basket is a large container, standing on the floor. Its first four strokes indicate that it is made of wicker, much like the small wicker basket treated immediately above. To put something inside of the bushel basket, the legs at the bottom are attached to the final horizontal stroke and extended to make a kind of enclosure. [8]"
heisig: "Bushel basket . . . yawn."
