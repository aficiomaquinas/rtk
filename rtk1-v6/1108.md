1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 30-10-2007(238): Horror scene: Hanging from the <em>ceiling</em>, a <em>plough</em> and <em>fishhook</em> <em>dripping</em> with blood down onto the <strong>tile</strong>d bathroom floor.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penot">penot</a>] 28-11-2008(176): [<strong>true stroke order</strong>] First draw <em><strong>T</strong></em> for<strong> Tile</strong>, which then becomes <em><strong>I</strong></em>. Then draw an <em>&#039;<strong>L</strong>&#039; fish hook</em> with a <em>dash</em> in the middle to make a mediocre &#039;<strong>e</strong>&#039; that few can see.//ガ wa3 와 (wa).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Biene">Biene</a>] 5-5-2008(96): Note: This <strong>tile</strong> means roof-<strong>tile</strong> (e.g. 屋根瓦 ), not the ones you put on the floor. Hanging from the <em>ceiling</em> of an old shed are a rusty <em>plow</em> and some tangled up <em>fishhooks</em>. Since the <strong>tiles</strong> on the roof are old and broken some rainwater is leeking through and you can see <em>drops</em> glistening between the <em>plow</em> and the <em>fishhooks</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 24-5-2006(18): As said in errata, this is ceiling+plow+fishhook+a drop of (and stroke order goes accordingly). A plow is fixed on the ceiling and a fishhook is hanging on the plow, drawing a drop of blood from it (if animals can talk, why can&#039;t plows bleed? :-).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 4-7-2009(11): Simple ~ spell out the word. First draw a T, then add a line on the bottom to change it to an I. Draw an L (the fishhook shape) then go back and add a dash beside the I, like adding the center dash of an E.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 2-6-2008(10): Heisig screwed this one up in the 4th edition. Primitives should be <em>ceiling</em>, <em>plow</em>, <em>fishhook</em>, <em>drop</em>. You&#039;re <em>plowing</em> the<strong> tile</strong> when a <em>drop</em> of blood falls from a <em>fishhook</em> on the <em>ceiling</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 26-11-2008(8): A scene from an Indiana Jones movie: Indie steps on a<strong> tile</strong>, which triggers a trap. A <strong>plow</strong>(I picture a scyth) swings down from the <strong>ceiling</strong>. On the tip of the <strong>plow</strong> is a <strong>hook</strong> glistening with poison(the <strong>drop</strong>).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 20-5-2011(4): I wanted neat, orderly<strong> tile</strong>s that all 互 <a href="../v4/757">mutually</a> (#757 互) resembled each other. However, the little<strong> tile</strong>s I got are uneven and asymmetrical with a big crack in the middle! 瓦落多 =がらくた= junk; rubbish; trash; garbage; odds and ends.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv">astgtciv</a>] 10-7-2007(4): Ceiling+plow+fishhook+drop. You are <em>plowing</em> the <em>ceiling</em> in your shower with a <em>fishhook</em> (hoping to plant something that will grow well in the moist environment of the shower), <em>drops</em> of plaster falling onto the bathroom <strong>tiles</strong> below.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sir_sanuk">sir_sanuk</a>] 6-1-2011(3): A heavy <em>plow</em> and old <em>fishhooks</em> hanging from the <em>ceiling</em> have pulled off a roof<strong> tile</strong>, allowing <em>drops</em> of rainwater through.
