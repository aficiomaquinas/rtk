1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erikkusan">erikkusan</a>] 19-3-2006(187): Under the<strong> eaves</strong> of the house the poor family has potate plants.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 23-4-2006(84): Very good image Erik. To help those who struggleded with this, the<strong> eaves</strong> of a house is usually the bit where you hang the roof gutter along, usually made of zinc or plastic and shaped as a half-pipe. It catches rain water, so it flows to a drain pipe instead of down onto people and windows. And in this family the potato plants grow along the<strong> eaves</strong> so the water pours down on them. They are poor. so no gutter.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 9-3-2008(45): This kanji means <strong>universe</strong>, seen here as a <em>roof</em> as that was how it was represented back then the <em>vault of heaven</em>. Today, we know that seen from the <strong>universe</strong>, our planet has the aspect of a <em>potato</em>, and not a perfect sphere.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/igordesu">igordesu</a>] 13-2-2009(11): Sam at the beginning of the Lord of the Rings was outside the house in the potato bushes when Gandalf was talking with Frodo, even though he denied it: &quot;I wasn&#039;t dropping no<strong> eaves</strong>, sir. Honest!&quot;.
