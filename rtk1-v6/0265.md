heisig: "The idea of something getting <b>jammed into</b> something else is depicted here by having a <i>walking stick</i> get <b>jammed into</b> an <i>umbrella</i> frame by someone shoving it into an already occupied slot in the <i>umbrella</i> stand at the door. First notice the vertical strokes: on the left is the curved umbrella handle, and on the right the straight <i>walking stick</i>. Now try to imagine the two parties tugging at their respective properties like two kids on a wishbone, creating a scene at the entrance of an elegant restaurant."
primit: "umbrella The actual character on which this primitive meaning umbrella is based we shall not meet until FRAME 1026 傘. We may think of it as a large and brightly-colored beach umbrella. If you compare this with FRAME 8 八, you will notice how the two strokes touch here, while the kanji for eight would leave a gaping leak in the top. [2]"
