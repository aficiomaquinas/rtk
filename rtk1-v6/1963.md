Of course not! This conference is about bigger and better ideas (throws<strong> wheel</strong> offstage).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 8-12-2006(4): <strong>Wheel</strong> - related to <em>cars</em>...what a boring <em>Panini sticker album</em> that would be...collecting pictures of<strong> wheel</strong>s. No thanks!
