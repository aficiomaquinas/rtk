1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adhmm">adhmm</a>] 23-11-2007(131): Someone stole all the<strong> wheel</strong>s off the ladies&#039; cars at the scrapbook convention.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 17-9-2007(112): During a talk at the <em>academic conference</em>, speaker shows an introductory slide depicting the structure of <em>car</em>, and then moves on to the more narrow topic of <strong>wheels</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tzadeck">Tzadeck</a>] 19-8-2009(45): At an <em>academic conference</em> many thousands of years ago, the uses of the<strong> wheel</strong> were discussed--eventually leading to the invention of the <em>car</em>. I sort of imagine a TED conference with cavemen discussing the<strong> wheel</strong> with a 2001 Space Oddesy-esc transition to Henry Ford also at a TED conference. (www.ted.com A seriously good website).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 5-3-2007(16): You have to be <em>methodical</em>. Before you invent the <em>car</em>, you&#039;ll need to invent the<strong> wheel</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 15-7-2007(15): It&#039;s a strange <em>scrapbook</em> <em>meeting</em> with albums full of <em>cars</em> and<strong> wheel</strong>s.
