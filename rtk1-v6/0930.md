heisig: "If you think of the <i>ten</i> as a little &quot;cross&quot; sitting atop the root of a <i>house</i> where we are used to seeing the &quot;chimney&quot; (<i>drop</i>), then you have the image of a <i>chapel</i>. (This combination will appear once more in this book: Frame 1465.) To complete the picture for <b>uprising</b>, add: <i>child</i> . . . <i>muscles</i>."
