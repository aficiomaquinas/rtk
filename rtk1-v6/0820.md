primit: "infant This primitive can be seen as an abbreviation of the full primitive for child, the second stroke dividing the head from the body much as it does in { and the other strokes condensing the long form so that it can be used atop its relative primitive. We change the meaning to infant to facilitate keeping the full form and its abbreviation distinct. [4]"

Hence, it would be best to avoid using mountain in your story. <strong>Story</strong>: An inhumane way to<strong> abandon</strong> an <em>infant</em> is to <em>buckle</em> him to a <em>tree</em>...
