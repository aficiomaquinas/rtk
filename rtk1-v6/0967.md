1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 5-9-2007(205): In AUTUMN, the farmer&#039;s HEART is in<strong> DISTRESS</strong> as to if he has enough crops. Even better, the farmer will experience great<strong> DISTRESS</strong> in his HEART if his WHEAT catches FIRE!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 28-4-2006(112): Here we have<strong> distress</strong>ed (think &quot;gloomy&quot;) people with &quot;seasonal mood disorder&quot; during the autumn season. Hence &quot;autumn heart&quot; is<strong> distress</strong>ed (gloomy).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 18-12-2007(55): The HEART becomes<strong> distress</strong>ed in the AUTUMN when summer loves end.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 16-5-2008(29): The damsel in<strong> distress</strong> was tied to a big stalk of <em>wheat</em> in the middle of a field.. The evil, dastardly villain then set the field on <em>fire</em>! Can our hero get to her in time, saving her life and winning her <em>heart</em>?? Tune in next week!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jaunty">Jaunty</a>] 12-6-2009(20): I have to imagine a &quot;damsel in<strong> distress</strong>&quot; to avoid confusing this with similar keywords. Think of Rapunzel sitting in her tower staring out at the <em>autumn</em> scenery, her <em>heart</em> aching.
