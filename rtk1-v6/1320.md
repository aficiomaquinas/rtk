5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 6-3-2007(11): In ancient times, feudal lords agreed on a method to fairly distribute land. Each lord would stand on the top of a different hill and shoot an arrow by pulling back on the <em>bow</em> at exactly the length from hand to <em>elbow</em>. The arrow&#039;s distance would serve as the radius of his new<strong> vast</strong> territory.
