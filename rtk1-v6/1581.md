1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 30-11-2008(180): Your<strong> daughter</strong> is a good girl......well, let&#039;s hope so... :-).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula">CountPacula</a>] 25-7-2008(80): Be careful <strong>not</strong> to think woman + angel here, which has already been seen for <a href="../v4/430">attractive</a> (#430 嬌). Suggest using <em>woman</em> with a <em>halo</em>, as in an innocent girl, something that everyone sees their <strong>daughters</strong> as being.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 12-7-2006(33): Parents wish that their<strong> daughter</strong> grows up to be a good woman.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 25-3-2012(7): A <em>woman</em> with a <em>halo</em>, that&#039;s what your <strong>daughter</strong> seems like while she&#039;s growing up. But you have no idea ;).
