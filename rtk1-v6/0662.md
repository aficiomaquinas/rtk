1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/szreter">szreter</a>] 15-2-2008(283): <strong>Emotion</strong> is a <em>march of mouths</em> inside your <em>heart</em> telling you what to feel.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 17-7-2008(130): Strong<strong> EMOTION</strong>S don&#039;t stay hidden. They march right out of one&#039;s <em>heart</em> (below) and out <em>one</em>&#039;s <em>mouth</em> (shouted, snarled, or gently whispered - depending on exactly what kind of<strong> emotion</strong> it is!).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 19-5-2009(24): When you get<strong> emotion</strong>al, words come marching out of your mouth from your heart, and it&#039;s impossible to stop them.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 10-9-2007(17): Picture a site that consists solely of emoticons (represented by the mouth) marching across the screen - you know, hundreds of them. Imagine how much this website would slow down your computer. At this point you might consider stabbing the site&#039;s creator in the heart. (inspired by taijuando).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins">matt_jenkins</a>] 24-3-2008(9): Emoticons held a <em>march</em> to protest against their low status in communication. Along went all those <em>little mouths</em>, shouting as <em>one</em>, riding not on horses but big squidgy <em>hearts</em>, bouncing one pace with each beat. Sadly, many were &#039;tired and<strong> EMOTION</strong>al&#039; (<em>euphemism for &#039;drunk&#039; in the British Press</em>) and they all started squabbling, at which point the march fell apart.
