heisig: "As a &quot;Western&quot; language, English identifies the <b>east</b> with the rising <i>sun</i>. In more fanciful terms, we see the <i>sun</i> piercing through a <i>tree</i> as it rises in the <b>east</b>."
commen: "* Both the direction <i>east</i> and the part of the world called &quot;the <i>East</i>&quot; are primitive meanings of this character."
