1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 31-1-2007(340): Ok, this is a little wierd, but i took this back to the kanji for <a href="../v4/254">pagoda</a> (#254 塔). I think it helps simplify the image, and also helps anchor the pagoda kanji in memory better as an added bonus. say this aloud once, and i think it will bring out a vivid image very quickly: &quot;Now<strong> board</strong>ing the <em>pagoda</em> ride. Please keep your <em>fingers</em> inside at all times...&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando">taijuando</a>] 20-4-2006(86): When you<strong> board</strong> the ship on the way out from Hawaii a beautiful crewmember takes her <em>fingers</em> and fits a lei around you ....a lei is <em>flowers</em> <em>fitted together</em> with your <em>fingers</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 22-10-2006(39): A romantic scene. A woman stands near to her sailor, rolling the lone <em>flower</em> that he gave her between her <em>fingers</em> because she is sad that he must leave. When the time comes for the captain to shout, &quot;All aboard!,&quot; the sailor bends deeply forward to give her one final &quot;<em>meeting</em> of the <em>mouths</em>,&quot; powerful enough to cause her <em>flower</em> to drop out of her <em>fingers</em> and into the sea.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 23-6-2009(23): All aboard! <em>Fingers</em> waving goodbye, <em>flowers</em> tossed in the air, and the <em>meeting of mouths</em> as lovers say goodbye.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/breton">breton</a>] 10-3-2008(19): A new torture technique called &quot;flower-boarding&quot; instead of the popular &quot;water-boarding&quot;. It&#039;s quite simple: Use your fingers to make some flowers fit into the prisoner&#039;s mouth. Pretty effective!
