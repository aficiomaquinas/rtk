heisig: "You can think of this kanji as a stylized pictograph of the nose, that little <i>drop</i> that Mother Nature set between your <i>eyes</i>. The Japanese refer to themselves by pointing a finger at their nose - giving us an easy way to remember the kanji for <b>oneself</b>."
commen: "* The same meaning of <i>oneself</i> can be kept when this kanji is used as a primitive element, but you will generally find it better to give it the meaning of <i>nose</i> or <i>nostrils</i>, both because it accords with the story above and because it is the first part of the kanji for <i>nose</i> (Frame 733)."

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indigo360">indigo360</a>] 22-7-2008(77): I know this, but I am an idiot and forgot.... The way I remember this is to think of the way in which Japanese people point to themselves if they are unsure of who is being spoken to. In the west, we usually say, &quot;me?&quot; and point to ourselves (pointing to the chest), but in Japan, people say, &quot;ore/boku/atashi?&quot; and point directly at their nose, the drop between their eyes. True story.
