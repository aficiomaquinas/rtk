heisig: "No doubt you will find it in your heart to forgive me for forcing yet another Japanese word on you in this frame. It is not the last time it will happen in this book, but I can assure you they are used only when absolutely necessary. One <b><i>rin</i></b> is equal to about 1/1000 of a yen - or rather was worth that much when it still made economic sense to mint them. While inflation took its toll on this kanji as a monetary unit, it survived with the not at all surprising sense of something &quot;very, very tiny.&quot; The kanji shows a <i>cliff</i> with a <i>computer</i> under it, apparently because it has been pushed over into the abyss by someone fed up with the thing. The total market value of one home <i>computer</i> that has fallen over rock and bramble for several hundred feet: about one <b><i>rin</i></b>!"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep">krungthep</a>] 26-3-2008(198): I threw my<strong> Rin</strong>dows <em>computer</em> off a <em>cliff</em> because it kept crashing. Now, after its last crash, it&#039;s worth less than a<strong> rin</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomusan">tomusan</a>] 16-2-2008(76): A <em>computer</em> dropped off of a <em>cliff</em> would be worth about 1<strong> RIN</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD">PeterJD</a>] 7-4-2008(50): The Square Root of 1 RI = 1<strong> RIN</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 12-7-2007(33): He dropped his <em>computer</em> from the top of the <em>cliff</em> and it turned to smithe-<strong> rin</strong> -s.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry">elktapestry</a>] 26-3-2007(25): Looking down at the 里 from the high cliff above such a tiny country village looks even smaller like something very very tiny and insignificant... Like a りん /<strong> Rin</strong>. Also might be worth-while to note now that this isn&#039;t just 1/10th of a 銭 but also 1/10th of a 分 or rather... 0.3mm in length. Perhaps imagine holding up a ruler from that high up to measure the tiny speck of a 里 below and note it coming out to 0.3mm in length. <a href="http://google.com/#q=ずっとずっと小さいですね～">ずっとずっと小さいですね～</a> !!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 25-4-2009(23): <strong>Note</strong>: The<strong> rin</strong> is an obsolete unit of Japanese currency equal to yen. Due to the drastic devaluation of Japanese money after World War II, the<strong> rin</strong> was eventually taken out of circulation at the end of 1953.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fabiomandrioli">fabiomandrioli</a>] 9-2-2009(20): My <em>parents&#039; house</em> is beneath a so dangerous <em>cliff</em> that they paid few<strong> rin</strong> for it back then.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nintendomaniac64">nintendomaniac64</a>] 28-7-2009(12): That <strong>Rin</strong> Tohsaka! I told her I was busy tonight from reviewing my kanji, but she just yelled &quot;LIKE HELL YOU ARE!&quot; and took my <em>computer</em> and threw it off a <em>cliff</em> claiming I wasn&#039;t taking this holy grail war thing seriously enough.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lewissk">lewissk</a>] 19-9-2010(11): When Mr. Heisig makes us learn Japanese words like &quot;rin,&quot; it makes me want to throw my computer off a cliff!!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr">stehr</a>] 29-6-2008(8): So as not to confuse the two, remember that the word &quot;<strong>rin</strong>&quot; is longer than &quot;ri&quot; and thus has those extra two strokes.
