1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 26-5-2007(229): <em>America</em> thinks it is the <em>pinnacle</em> of the world, looking down on all<strong> neighboring</strong> countries through its mirrored, aviator <em>sunglasses</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/desmidus">desmidus</a>] 30-3-2008(184): All the<strong> neighboring</strong> communities to the Pinnacle have a major problem. The kids at the Pinnacle have a habit of throwing down rice from the city walls in all directions, so people in<strong> neighboring</strong> communities are forced to wear sunglasses all the time in order to avoid getting rice in their eyes.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-2-2008(55): Tip: <em>rice</em> + <em>sunglasses</em> : In RTK3 Heisig names this combination &quot;<em>shoeshine</em>&quot;. It also appears in: <a href="../v4/2051.html">sympathize with</a> (#2051 憐), <a href="../v4/2052.html">phosphorus</a> (#2052 燐), <a href="../v4/2053.html">camelopard</a> (#2053 麟), <a href="../v4/2054.html">scaled</a> (#2054 鱗). Story: You visit the <em>Acropolis</em> and are amazed to see the guy from your<strong> neighboring</strong> house back home working there as a <em>shoeshiner</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 23-4-2009(32): Tom Cruise (<em>American</em> with <em>sunglasses</em>) tried to get admitted to <em>The Pinnacle</em> but, with all the weird press, he was rejected and so now lives in a<strong> neighboring</strong> Scientology exclusive gated community.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 5-2-2007(19): <em>The Pinnacle</em>&#039;s<strong> neighboring</strong> mount is a place where they grow rice. They wear <em>sunglasses</em> since it&#039;s the sun&#039;s glare is so strong there.
