heisig: "Imagine a village <i>market</i>&nbsp;with stalls set up around an immense <b>persimmon</b>&nbsp;<i>tree</i>&nbsp;with watermelon-sized fruit. If it weren't for the fact that the <i>tree</i>&nbsp;is sacred to the village, people would get impatient as the <b>persimmons</b>&nbsp;fall from the <i>tree</i>&nbsp;and wreak havoc on buyers and sellers alike."
