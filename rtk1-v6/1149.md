1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 7-9-2007(233): WATER always<strong> LEAK</strong>ED in the spot left by the FLAG planted in the roof everytime it RAINED. Not too hard to picture a hole left in the ceiling from a flag, now<strong> leak</strong>ing water.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide">wasurenaide</a>] 16-11-2007(77): Mark the holes where <em>rain water</em> can<strong> leak</strong> through with little <em>flags</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/minakamikoi">minakamikoi</a>] 21-5-2008(23): When you want to take a<strong> LEAK</strong> in Japan, first you turn the lock on your stall so the little <em>FLAG</em> shows red, and then you push the button on the armrest of the fancy-schmancy toilet that makes the <em>RAIN</em> sounds, and only then can you finally be allowed to let some <em>WATER</em> out, yourself.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 19-7-2008(17): When I need to take a<strong> leak</strong>, I think of <em>water</em> dripping or a downpour of <em>rain</em> falling. That gets the <em>pee</em> flowing. (Note: I use &quot;pee&quot; for the &quot;flag&quot; primitive.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/axelb">axelb</a>] 11-4-2009(14): When the roof started to<strong> leak</strong> in the rain I used <em>a flag</em> to stop it, but, alas, still <em>water</em> coming in. It may seem like just <em>drops of water</em> from the outside, but inside it is like it&#039;s <em>raining</em>.
