The two parts of the kanji represent the two statistical <strong>distribution</strong>s for bosons and fermions. The Bose-Einstein <strong>distribution</strong> is represented by the <em>sign of the bird</em> because birds, like bosons, are social creatures who like to flock together. The Fermi-Dirac <strong>distribution</strong> is represented by a <em>snake</em>, since <em>snake</em>s, like fermions, are solitary creatures who like to keep to themselves.
