heisig: "The complex of strokes in this kanji is unusual and difficult, because of the fourth stroke, which is rare (see frames 33 and 34). The <i>mouth</i> and <i>tool</i> are already familiar."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 14-3-2007(262): As a present, I <strong>gave</strong> my dentist a <em>hand-crank tool</em> for spreading <em>mouths</em>. He was so happy since it makes his job easier.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 27-10-2006(66): I see this as a pictograph of an old-style phonograph - a stand, record, crank and bell (the mouth). Even the primitives work out - a <em>tool</em> with a <em>crank</em> which plays music out of the bell <em>mouth</em>. Imaginge <strong>giving</strong> one of these old and beautiful phonographs to a classical or jazz music buff!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 11-3-2008(55): This kanji does not mean &quot;give&quot; as in &quot;give to someone.&quot; It means &quot;give&quot; in the sense that someone gave you something, or did something for your benefit when combined with a gerund (-te/-de form) of a verb. STORY: Your working in a factory and your hand gets stuck in one of the gears. You yell with a big MOUTH, &quot;HELP!&quot; and one of your co-workers runs over,<strong> GIVE</strong>S YOU a HAND-CRANK TOOL, and goes back to work. =(.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 5-12-2007(10): Some dude is changing a flat tire. He opens his <em>mouth</em> to say, &quot;GIVE me that <em>tool</em>,...what was it called again? Oh yeah, a <em>tire iron</em>.&quot; (The forth stroke looks like a tire iron to me.).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hunchbag">hunchbag</a>] 20-11-2009(8): I was going to<strong> give</strong> you a <em>hand-crank tool</em> but I eated it. :(.
