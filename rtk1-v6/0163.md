heisig: "One of the things that causes the erosion of <i>soil</i> is the excessive <b>pressure</b> of the top<i>soil</i> on the lower <i>soil</i>. This can be caused by any number of things from heavy rainfall to heavy buildings to the absence of sufficient deep-rooted vegetation to hold the layers together. Here we see a steep <i>cliff</i> without a tree in sight. The <b>slightest</b> pressure on it will cause a landslide, which, with a little help from your imagination, you will be able to see happening in this character."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 30-7-2007(212): The GROUND at the base of a CLIFF must suffer from enormous<strong> pressure</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 4-8-2007(52): For physics people: p = F/A (p:pressure, F:Force, A:Area). Where the force is from the immensity of the cliff. The area on the cliff is covered by soil. So the equation becomes p = F/A = cliff/soil which preserves the position of the primitives.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe">stereovibe</a>] 11-3-2008(38): The <em>cliff</em> exerts a lot of<strong> pressure</strong> on the <em>ground</em> beneath it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rasteps">rasteps</a>] 1-10-2006(24): The taller the <em>cliff</em>, the more<strong> pressure</strong> on the <em>soil</em> below it.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen">Ningen</a>] 26-8-2008(10): Be careful of landslides! The <em>soil</em> under the <em>cliff</em> is under enormous<strong> PRESSURE</strong>.
