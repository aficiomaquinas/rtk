1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 15-2-2007(135): (Image: while Batman is out, Robin is smokin&#039; a huge doob in a secret corner of the Bat<em>cave</em> where he nurtures his<strong> hemp</strong> <em>grove</em>).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/madheavy">madheavy</a>] 30-1-2008(110): Where is the best place to hid your <em>grove</em> of<strong> hemp</strong> trees? In a cave, you <em>dope</em>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle">calittle</a>] 23-9-2007(45): The world&#039;s most prolific drug dealer maintains a massive <em>grove</em> of<strong> hemp</strong> in a <em>cave</em> to avoid law enforcement.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 19-5-2009(35): <strong>Hemp</strong> is an extremely useful material and can be used to make produce healthy oils (such as omega-3 and 6), fibers for clothing, biomass for fuel and even sturdy industrial matierals. (All of this is true.) Unfortunately, because the USDEA is run by a bunch of morons that refuse to distinguish between it and marijuana, you can&#039;t get a permit to grow it and thus have to grow your<strong> hemp</strong> groves in a cave to avoid fines and prosecution.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/osaki">osaki</a>] 8-5-2007(13): The<strong> hemp</strong> grove is in the cave.
