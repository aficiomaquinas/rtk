2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tcjeff">tcjeff</a>] 18-6-2008(122): <em>Americans</em> think that tattoos with Chinese characters are<strong> chic</strong>, but <em>nine</em> out of <em>ten</em> times they end up with something trivial tattooed on their arm, like <em>rice</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ">DavidZ</a>] 30-1-2010(53): <strong>TIP:</strong> This kanji is actually <strong>iki</strong> (いき), which is one of those Japanese words that cannot be translated. If you can use it correctly, Japanese people will do backflips. See &quot;Iki (aesthetic ideal)&quot; on Wikipedia... STORY:<strong> Chic</strong> was an <em>American</em> disco band that was truly great -- better than <em>9/10ths</em> of all disco bands... 純粋 [じゅんすい] pure.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paultakatsu">paultakatsu</a>] 2-4-2007(25): Right now it is<strong> chic</strong> for Americans to get kanji for tattoos. Imagine a whole American baseball team showing up in Japan on their first trip and getting the kanji for USA (talk about national pride!). Imagine their expressions when the Japanese see just plain old rice. Look at the long tattoo needle used to put in the tattoo.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 9-1-2008(13): Wealthy <em>American</em>s try to look<strong> chic</strong> by playing the British sport of <em>cricket</em>.
