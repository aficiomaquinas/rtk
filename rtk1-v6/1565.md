2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 5-1-2010(45): Traditionally, 青 <a href="../v4/1534">blue</a> (#1534 青) could be used to describe blue OR green. However, two kanji that describe the hues specifically are 藍 and 緑 . This kanji is the &quot;blue&quot; counterpart of <a href="../v4/1371">green</a> (#1371 緑). Story: The <em>overseer</em>, master of the slaves, wore a cloak dyed with<strong> indigo</strong>, and <em>flowers</em> in his hair.
