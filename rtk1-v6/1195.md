1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narafan">narafan</a>] 2-10-2007(154): <strong>Push</strong> the <em>roots</em> down, instead of plucking the seedling.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 4-3-2007(100): Use your <em>fingers</em> to make sure the <em>roots</em> of your plant are deep underground by <strong>pushing</strong> them down, down, down.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 26-12-2007(67): <strong>Push</strong> the button with your <em>finger</em> and get <em>root</em> beer!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/claxton">claxton</a>] 25-7-2008(17): For those who liked the &quot;bird&#039;s eye view of the tank&quot; imagine a tank that has its tracks stuck in the sand. The big green machine is extremely hot from the desert sun as well as the heat its engine has created. With that picture in mind, this Kanji depicts what happens next when the soldiers get around the back of the tank and have to<strong> push</strong> it with their fingers because the surface is too hot for them to put their hands on.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 10-5-2008(16): You are wearing your cool new <em>Ninja Turtles Shell Armour</em> and you realize that there&#039;s a little button with a <em>finger</em> symbol on it, inviting you to<strong> push</strong> it. You<strong> push</strong> it, and the front wall of the shell <strong>push</strong>es out violently. You&#039;ve learned a new attack - this isn&#039;t just a defense tool anymore, you can now run around and<strong> push</strong> people around for no reason! Cool!
