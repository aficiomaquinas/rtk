1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 30-1-2008(297): This is “Cape Strange” from FRAME 153, only with <em>mountain</em> in place of <em>soil</em>. Interestingly, there is also 碕 which is made of the primitives<em> stone</em> and <em>strange</em>. The three kanjis 碕, 埼 and 崎 all have the same meanings and pronunciations. They have very little uses other than names, for which<strong> promontory</strong> is the clear winner with over 2300 uses in place and people names, while the other two kanjis account for less than 200 names.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 3-9-2007(128): A<strong> promontory</strong> is a small, <em>strange mountain</em> that juts out into the sea.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 4-5-2009(32): <strong>Pro<em>mount</em>ory</strong>. A <em>strange</em> word, indeed.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 14-5-2008(22): A<strong> promontory</strong> is a <em>mountain strange</em> (not a mountain range) that juts out like Cape Odd.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep">krungthep</a>] 12-12-2009(17): Ayumi Hamasaki 浜崎 あゆみ will promote her Nagasaki 長崎 concert with a <em>strange</em> promotional stunt: she will ride a Kawasaki 川崎 to the top of a<strong> promontory</strong> <em>mountain</em>.
