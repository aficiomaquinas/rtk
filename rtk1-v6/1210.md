1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 30-12-2006(261): The end is<strong> near</strong>. The <em>axe</em>-murderer is waiting for you on the <em>road</em>...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zenkun">zenkun</a>] 13-3-2006(98): An absurd image, but working for me: two points A and B are separated by a long <em>road</em>. To make A and B<strong> near</strong>, take an <em>ax</em>, cut a big chunk of road, and the work is done.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei">javiergakusei</a>] 21-11-2007(60): Hint: Short- cut.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 14-9-2007(28): An <em>axe</em> left in the middle of the <em>road</em>! Dwarves must be<strong> near</strong>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 7-6-2008(15): When I think of &quot;<strong> near</strong> &quot;, I always think of that absurd muppet sketch with Grover running back and forth to demonstrate &quot;<strong> near</strong> &quot; and &quot;far&quot;. So, I see grover on the <em>road</em> somewhere and I shout to him and ask him if he can show me &quot;<strong> near</strong> &quot;. He runs up to me and shouts &quot;<strong> Near</strong> !&quot;Then I kill him with my <em>axe</em> and sling him over my shoulder. We&#039;re having muppet for dinner tonight!Now that you all think I&#039;m insane, you should probably watch this, haha. <a href="http://video.aol.com/video-detail/eating-muppets/3865632416">http://video.aol.com/video-detail/eating-muppets/3865632416</a>.
