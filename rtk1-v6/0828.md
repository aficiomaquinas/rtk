1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LordGolem">LordGolem</a>] 17-7-2007(232): I named the right part <em>legal prostitute</em> has it represents a walker [<em>walking legs</em>] with the <em>license</em>. It&#039;s easy to imagine a <em>legal prostitute</em><strong> tempt</strong>ing a man with her <em>mouth</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 20-2-2007(154): Prostitutes in Amsterdam have a <em>license</em> to show off their <em>walking legs</em> and<strong> tempt</strong> customers with their <em>mouths</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 2-5-2007(48): Tip : the right side can be thought of as a profession where one works on the street, for which they require a &quot;<em>license</em> to work on their <em>walking legs</em>&quot;. This could be a <em>sandwich man</em>, or a <em>prostitute</em> (see gorgon&#039;s story). In this case, it&#039;s easily remembered as a prostitute<strong> tempt</strong>ing passers-by with her <em>mouth</em>. The combination will appear again in frames 1014, and 1437, and another four times in RTK Volume 3, where it is known as <em>streetwalker</em> (which is very close).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois">Francois</a>] 21-4-2008(20): With a hot <em>mouth</em>, a <em>licence</em> to screw and a <em>pair of legs</em>, Amsterdam prostitutes are sure to<strong> tempt</strong> you.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dicedice">dicedice</a>] 6-6-2008(16): The cop that pulled me over was such a prick, and I was sooo<strong> tempt</strong>ed to <em>mouth</em> off at him! However, I LEFT my mouth shut because I knew if I didn&#039;t, he would suspend my <em>license</em> for quite some time, and I&#039;d be stuck with my <em>walking legs</em>.
