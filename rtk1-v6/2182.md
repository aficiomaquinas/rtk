1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 18-10-2007(193): To<strong> upbraid</strong> someone, you criticize them in a menacing way. In other words, you jaw at them with your MOUTH until both sides of their face turn RED (hence the double-red).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 20-2-2008(77): Tip: Heisig later names 赫 &quot;red + red&quot; as <a href="../v4/2908">incandescent</a> (#2908 赫). Story: &quot;So the boss<strong> upbraid</strong>ed you, huh?&quot;. &quot;Yep, his <em>mouth</em> was <em>incandescent</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 8-11-2007(30): Halpern&#039;s dictionary goes with <strong>intimidate</strong>, so I&#039;ll stick to <strong>menacing</strong>. The kanji for red ( 赤 ) is usually only fully formed when it is on the left, as in 赦 , so as a primitive, fully red on the left = <em>commie</em>. This kanji is unusual in that the commies (2 of them!) have moved over to the right and taken over this entire kanji. The little mouth on the left is protesting what can only be a pictoral representation of the <strong>red menace</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 9-4-2007(16): A father <strong>upbraid</strong>s his daughter for the <em>red</em> lipstick and little <em>red</em> dress. &quot;You&#039;re not going out like that!&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 15-1-2006(11): Kanji meanings : to reproach, to scold (note the <em>mouth</em> to the left). This english word is unusual for me, as I thought it referred to braids. So to tie it all up together I imagine two women of the middle-age playing cards. One of them puts down <em>a pair of reds</em> (the <em>red</em> cards, to avoid the primitive <em>two</em>, which is not the same). The other woman thinks she is cheating, and they start scolding each other (that is<strong> upbraid</strong>ing, with their <em>mouth</em>), and pulling each other&#039;s braids up.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/phantombk201">phantombk201</a>] 7-10-2010(4): The farmer<strong> upbraid</strong>ed his daughter because she was eating 2 apples in her mouth at the same time(her cheeks were red),he was so menacing that her braids went up while he was screaming!&quot;DO YOU WANT US TO RUN OUT OF APPLES!?&quot;(thanks fuabrisu)　.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/davidvance">davidvance</a>] 29-1-2010(4): Pippi Longstocking has a big <em>mouth</em> and two <em>red</em><strong> upbraid</strong>s - pigtails. She often needs to be<strong> upbraid</strong>ed for her shenanigans.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonusbalonus">jonusbalonus</a>] 15-5-2013(3): &quot;It was more than an<strong> upbraid</strong>, sir. The sergeant was downright <strong>menacing</strong> so I punched him in the <em>mouth</em> in self defence. He was <a href="../v4/2908">incandescent</a> (#2908 赫) with rage, sir.&quot; Thanks Katsuo.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gwadonna">gwadonna</a>] 18-4-2009(3): Sometimes I just can&#039;t understand men! Look at this couple right there, his girlfriend has noticed 2 red kiss marks next to his mouth but the guy in question still don&#039;t see the reason why of her an anger and why she is<strong> upbraid</strong>ing him!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 19-11-2006(3): A teenage daughter is<strong> upbraid</strong>ed by her father by attempting to go out dressed like that - complete with <em>red</em>, <em>red</em> lipstick on her <em>mouth</em>!
