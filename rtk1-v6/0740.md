1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu">nolusu</a>] 24-7-2007(276): Genie in the bottle does<strong> exist</strong> but you need to dig deep into the soil to find one.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 24-1-2008(66): You wipe the <em>soil</em> from the bottle, only to have a genie float out above you, saying: &#039;I am the <em>genie in a bottle</em>, what is your wish?&#039; So now you know that they do<strong> exist</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rizzo">rizzo</a>] 13-3-2006(46): Genies don&#039;t<strong> exist</strong>! If you open the <em>&quot;genie in a bottle&quot;</em> you&#039;ll find nothing but <em>soil</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 2-6-2008(22): Only one extra stroke separates this from <a href="../v4/152">pressure</a> (#152 圧). // If <em>genies</em> do<strong> EXIST</strong> in bottles, they must certainly be crammed in them under extreme pressure ( 圧 ). If you really want to make sure that they do<strong> exist</strong>, be sure to clean the <em>dirt</em> off the lamp and give it an &#039;extra stroke&#039; to find out!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc">blackstockc</a>] 14-10-2007(18): When Aladin discovered the <em>magic bottle</em>, he rubbed it and nothing happened. He then concluded that genies did not<strong> exist</strong>. However, upon arriving home, he saw that the spout was filled with <em>soil</em>. After cleaning the bottle the genie emerged and disperesed the skeptical Aladin&#039;s doubts.
