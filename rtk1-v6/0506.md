1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 6-7-2008(281): This is clearly a<strong> BLOW</strong>JOB, we can see the MOUTH and the LACK OF condom. (I am sorry for the image, but it sticks forever in your mind).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 21-1-2008(70): How am I supposed to<strong> BLOW</strong> if I <em>lack</em> a <em>mouth</em>? (Imagine a kid at his own birthday party, and - like Neo in the Matrix - had no oriface where his mouth was to be. And yet, the people cruelly cheer him on to<strong> blow</strong> out his candles...).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 29-7-2007(58): I keep confusing this with <a href="../v4/689.html">suck</a> (#689 吸). Consider someone<strong> blow</strong>ing bubbles using their chewing gum because they&#039;re <em>lack</em>ing attention in class.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue">notgoing2argue</a>] 6-4-2007(41): After your <em>mouth opens</em> and you <em>yawn</em>, you<strong> BLOW</strong> out a lot of air.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meredithcat">meredithcat</a>] 4-4-2010(25): <strong>Blowing</strong> makes your <em>mouth</em> <em>lack</em> air.
