1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 28-2-2007(175): This whole kanji is a picture of <strong>calm</strong>ness. The <em>wheat</em> has been harvested and even the <em>vultures</em> sit<strong> calm</strong>ly watching the humans <em>sweep</em> and clean-up after the harvest is over. <em>Hearts</em> are peaceful and<strong> calm</strong> at this time of the year. Even the days are<strong> calm</strong> without storm.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joesan">joesan</a>] 29-10-2007(142): The farmer is<strong> calm</strong> knowing that his <em>wheat</em> fields are protected from <em>vultures</em> by his <em>strawman</em> with a <em>heart</em> (all the better to do the job properly).

He just lightly brushes them away with a broom, barely noticing their presence.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 6-8-2008(35): Creepy but<strong> calm</strong> bucolic scene: In a field of wheat, a vulture sits atop a scarecrow&#039;s broom,<strong> calm</strong>ly eating a heart (a mouse heart?).
