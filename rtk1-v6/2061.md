1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 4-1-2007(165): This character refers to feudal<strong> clan</strong>s that were abolished in 1871 (Meiji 4) in favor of prefectures ( 廃藩置県 ), and thus were predecessors of the modern prefectures. As we know from 落 , flowers and water drops each have their own way of falling. This character says that<strong> clan</strong>s&#039; location was decided in the way flowers, water drops and dice fall: at random. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_%28country_subdivision%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_%28country_subdivision%29</a>.

What a double-life.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pm215">pm215</a>] 31-8-2008(15): [A story for people using the flower+water = seaweed primitive; see <a href="http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079">http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079</a>] It&#039;s commonly known that Japan&#039;s old feudal <strong>clan</strong>s were rated by how much rice they produced. It&#039;s less well known that they were also rated for <em>seaweed</em> (the other component of sushi). Each year the shogun would roll <em>dice</em> to determine which<strong> clan</strong> had the honour of providing him with nori that year.
