1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 4-1-2007(165): This character refers to feudal<strong> clan</strong>s that were abolished in 1871 (Meiji 4) in favor of prefectures ( 廃藩置県 ), and thus were predecessors of the modern prefectures. As we know from 落 , flowers and water drops each have their own way of falling. This character says that<strong> clan</strong>s&#039; location was decided in the way flowers, water drops and dice fall: at random. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_%28country_subdivision%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_%28country_subdivision%29</a>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erikkusan">erikkusan</a>] 5-4-2006(19): This is what members of Ku Klux<strong> Clan</strong> is doing when not meeting: pretending to live normal life by watering flowers during the day and playing dice-games with their families at night. What a double-life.
