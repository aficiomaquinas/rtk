1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erikkusan">erikkusan</a>] 15-3-2006(233): If you look into Japanese gardens they seem so<strong> peaceful</strong> - with their small bonsais and the white stones looking like rice grains.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 24-1-2008(52): A monk pleads with an invading warrior not to destroy his people. &quot;We are a<strong> peaceful</strong> people,&quot; the monk pleads. &quot;Our monks spend all of their time tending to their harmless <em>bonsai trees</em>. And as for food, we require only a few <em>grains of rice</em>.&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 3-9-2007(28): A <em>bonsai</em> with <em>rice</em> under it (to imitate a miniature white rock garden) is the epitome of a <strong>peaceful</strong> image.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/iVoid">iVoid</a>] 26-5-2008(12): I can&#039;t help but imagine a monk mediating under a bonsai tree, surviving only on a few grains of rice, seems so<strong> peaceful</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gibler">gibler</a>] 15-10-2010(7): A more simple Primitive than bonsai: <strong>3 people 三 ＋ 人 </strong> Nothing more<strong> Peaceful</strong> than <strong>3 friends/people</strong> from different cultures exchanging ways to fix food. From Japan Rice, from USA a nice burger, and Thailand Spicy Cashew Chicken!! RTK2:　タイ 泰国 たいこく (Thailand).
