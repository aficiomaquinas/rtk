1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 25-5-2007(178): It was the <strong>groundbreaking</strong> of the new farm, but there was an uninvited guest to the ceremony. It was a famous <em>skunk</em>, the one with the familiar <em>silver</em> stripe. The feet of the crowd rushing from the ceremony site churned up the <em>soil</em> very nicely. The ceremony was ruined but the <strong>groundbreaking</strong> was a great success.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inuki">inuki</a>] 2-1-2007(39): I got sprayed by a skunk, so no one is helping me with the<strong> groundbreaking</strong> of my farm. On a positive note, I found silver laying all over the soil. Mine all mine!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/takoman">takoman</a>] 23-6-2008(30): (コン) The <a href="../v4/1970">sociable</a> (#1970 懇) <em>silver skunk</em> might not look like a skunk, but when it lets it smell fly, it&#039;s so bad it actually leaves craters. That&#039;s right - it&#039;s<strong> groundbreaking</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 21-1-2009(24): <em>Pepe Le Pew&#039;s</em><strong> groundbreaking</strong> idea to fertilize <em>soil</em> with skunk fumes didn&#039;t really take off - the crops grew better than ever before, but nobody could stand the smell.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 10-12-2009(6): The <em>silver tailed skunk</em> has discovered a<strong> groundbreaking</strong> way to make skunks not smell, maybe that&#039;s explains why he&#039;s so <a href="../v4/1970">sociable</a> (#1970 懇).
