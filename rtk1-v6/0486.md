1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 11-1-2010(38): <strong>harmonious</strong>: If a choir is to be <strong>harmonious</strong>, <em>all</em> the voices need to combine to hit the right notes, and say the right <em>words</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 14-9-2010(14): Think of a chat in which <em>everyone</em> is writing <em>words</em> at once, of the lack of<strong> orderliness</strong> of such a chat.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chameleoncoder">chameleoncoder</a>] 19-8-2010(11): To have<strong> orderliness</strong>, your <em>words</em> must be in <em>all</em> the right places.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 1-6-2011(8): 起立 (きりつ)！ Hearing these <em>words</em>, <em>all</em> the students immediately stand at attention. The <strong>orderliness</strong> of classes in Japan is incredible.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 5-7-2010(8): <strong>to be in sync</strong>: The <em>words</em> a choir sings must <em>all</em> <strong>be in sync</strong>. ~~~ (Note: According to Yahoo! 辞書 , this character means something like &quot;to harmonize/to mitigate.&quot; I chose <strong>to be in sync</strong> as the keyword to both avoid conflicting with other keywords and to capture the general meaning of the kanji that can be applied to the various compounds that use it.).
