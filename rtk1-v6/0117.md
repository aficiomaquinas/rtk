heisig: "Perhaps you have heard of the custom, still preserved in certain African tribes, of a father creeping into the tent or hut of his newborn child on the night of the child's birth, to whisper into its ear the <b>name</b> he has chosen for it, before making his choice public. It is an impressive <b>naming</b> custom and fits in tidily with the way this character is constructed: <i>evening</i> . . . <i>mouth</i>. At <i>evening</i> time, a <i>mouth</i> pronounces the <b>name</b> that will accompany one throughout life."
