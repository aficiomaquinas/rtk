heisig: "The addition of a final stroke transforms this character from the primitive for a clenched <i>fist</i> into the kanji for <b>reaching out</b>, much as a stroke of kindness can often turn anger into acceptance."
commen: "* As a primitive, this shall stand for <i>outstretched hands</i>. Only take care not to confuse it with that for <i>beg</i> (Frame 501)"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Killersquierl">Killersquierl</a>] 22-11-2007(103): I like to think of this as a <em>fist</em> with with brass knuckles because of the extra line. An old school thug <strong>reaches out</strong> to help you up but then with his other hand ( with the brass knuckles) punches you.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 28-7-2008(97): <strong>Reach out</strong> and fist someone (Do you see the person primitive?).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 29-3-2007(49): I like to think of the MATRIX. Now hear me out... Remember the scene when Neo and Mr. Smith fought in the subway? there was this one part where Mr. Smith threw his <em>FIST</em> at Neo, but Neo stopped it. Mr. Smith <strong>reached out</strong> his finger (the line coming from fist) and hit Neo in the throat.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 14-10-2009(38): This is an image of the fist getting an arm (the new stroke). The FIST now <strong>reaches out</strong> farther than before.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Asriel">Asriel</a>] 16-3-2009(15): Dhalism (Street Figher) can<strong> reach out</strong> his <em>fist</em> an <em>extra stroke</em> farther than anyone else, even if their <em>hands are outstretched.</em>.
