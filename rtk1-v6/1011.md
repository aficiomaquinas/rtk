heisig: "<i>Bamboo</i> . . . <i>float</i>. Note that the drawing of the primitive for <i>float</i> uses the abbreviated form that has become standard in the general-use kanji and as we met it earlier (Frames 393-95). Until such time as typesetting fonts make the adjustment, only the older form has been approved. Here we have opted for the simpler, avant garde drawing."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 25-7-2007(74): Note: the spelling should be <strong>stationery</strong> (= paper, office supplies), not<strong> stationary</strong> (= not moving). The error is in the original book.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 30-9-2007(52): The <em>two fiestas</em> communicated to each other on their respective floats by using <em>bamboo</em> <strong>stationery</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enryu">enryu</a>] 5-9-2009(15): They used bamboo stationery to document where and when the two fiestas would take place.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hoticehunter">Hoticehunter</a>] 27-3-2012(10): Because this character was added to the Joyo list in 2010, it now uses a simplified version of the writing. It&#039;s now the &quot;float&quot; primitive instead of &quot;two fiestas&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shirahime">shirahime</a>] 17-7-2008(10): The fiesta celebrating bamboo and the fiesta celebrating<strong> stationary</strong> combined into one big fiesta celebrating bamboo<strong> stationary</strong>. You get giant bamboo pencils for attending.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/JNash">JNash</a>] 8-9-2011(6): Thanks to Heisig&#039;s eccentric ways, I have to use two different types of <em>bamboo</em> <strong>stationery</strong> to write this character. I got one set off a <em>float</em> at the student carnival the other day, and the other set at a <em>pair of awesome fiestas</em> the retirement village threw last week.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kaame">Kaame</a>] 2-10-2012(3): I&#039;m sitting here with my <em>bamboo</em> <strong>stationery</strong> at my job. It&#039;s a <em>party</em> a floor down and also two floors down, they probably have a <em>float</em> too, sigh!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiwiburner">kiwiburner</a>] 23-8-2012(3): If the stationery were improved, I could get a proper typeset for the <em>float</em> beneath the <em>bamboo</em>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 15-11-2010(3): 処方箋 =処方せん=処方䇳, 付箋 =附箋, 用箋 , 便箋 , 鄭箋 <a href="../v4/2991">stationary</a> (#2991 箋) セン( 浅 ) ... Parts: 竹 , 戔 (old 㦮) ... Story: <em>Pandas</em> make their <strong>Stationery</strong> out of <em>Old Parade floats</em>. They eat the living stuff, so they have to source the <strong>Stationery</strong> from old stuff.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/barbouraj">barbouraj</a>] 4-1-2012(2): Why was the <em>bamboo float</em> stati0nary? Well, because it was made out of <strong>stationery</strong> (it&#039;s just a model), of course! (Note: I use the simplified character, which uses float).
