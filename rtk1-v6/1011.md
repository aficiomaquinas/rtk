heisig: "<i>Bamboo</i> . . . <i>float</i>. Note that the drawing of the primitive for <i>float</i> uses the abbreviated form that has become standard in the general-use kanji and as we met it earlier (Frames 393-95). Until such time as typesetting fonts make the adjustment, only the older form has been approved. Here we have opted for the simpler, avant garde drawing."

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hoticehunter">Hoticehunter</a>] 27-3-2012(10): Because this character was added to the Joyo list in 2010, it now uses a simplified version of the writing. It&#039;s now the &quot;float&quot; primitive instead of &quot;two fiestas&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shirahime">shirahime</a>] 17-7-2008(10): The fiesta celebrating bamboo and the fiesta celebrating<strong> stationary</strong> combined into one big fiesta celebrating bamboo<strong> stationary</strong>. You get giant bamboo pencils for attending.
