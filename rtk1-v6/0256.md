heisig: "The key word in this frame refers to a suffix that gives the word before it an adjectival quality; hence we refer to it as &quot;<b>sort of thing</b>.&quot; Reverting to the time when dog was more widely eaten than it is today (See frame 127), we see here a large cauldron boiling over an <i>oven flame</i> with the <i>flesh</i> of a <i>chihuahua</i> being thrown into the whole concoction to make it into a &quot;hot-diggity, dog-diggity&quot; <b>sort of thing</b>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 11-10-2007(322): <em>Flesh</em> of a <em>dog</em> over a cooking fire = &quot;hotdog&quot;. There are all <strong>sorts of things</strong> in <em>hot dogs</em>. Believe me, you don&#039;t want to know what <strong>sort of things</strong> . Visualize the hotdog curling as it cooks, to remember the unusual way the flesh primitive curves in this kanji. (tweaked version of ziggr&#039;s. Thanks!).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 9-9-2006(98): There are all <strong>sorts of things</strong> in <em>hot dogs</em>. (I use <em>hot dog</em> for this primitive (<em>meat</em> of a <em>dog</em> over a <em>cooking fire</em>). I swear I can actually see the 月 here as a hot dog, with its slight curve and grill marks.).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977">mameha1977</a>] 16-10-2007(39): Putting the <em>flesh</em> of a <em>dog</em> on a <em>fire</em> is the<strong> sort of thing</strong> that will get you arrested.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vxnine">vxnine</a>] 21-9-2008(22): Imagine the <em>flesh</em> of a <em>dog</em> roasting OVER a fire. Gross. I&#039;d never want to eat that<strong> sort of thing</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sonofswin">Sonofswin</a>] 2-2-2009(18): The <em>moon</em> in the <em>evening</em> is the <strong>sort of thing</strong> that makes a <em>dog</em> howl as if <em>on fire</em>.
