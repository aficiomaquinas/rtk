1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 8-10-2006(142): This looks like a pictogram of 3 fingers from each hand trying to open up a crack in a wall. That&#039;s an<strong> un-</strong>believable way to escape from prison OR the<strong> UN-</strong> have a prison in the Hague.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/greenapple">greenapple</a>] 1-5-2006(109): People in the jail cell are<strong> un-</strong>friendly,<strong> un-</strong>comely, and<strong> un-</strong>cooperative.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/firebound12">firebound12</a>] 12-1-2009(48): Ever wanted to have an <strong>un</strong>do button in life? Well, when you&#039;re in a <em>jail cell</em>, that&#039;s when you most want to press that button.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Emiko">Emiko</a>] 18-8-2011(23): <strong>Un-</strong>zipped.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 10-6-2008(13): This is a pictograph of goatse. Rather<strong> un-</strong>appealing image, huh?
