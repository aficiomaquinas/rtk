1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 27-11-2008(253): Together with the next kanji, the keywords spell “send back the<strong> ring</strong>”. First we have a <em>jewel</em>. Next we have the <em>great eye</em> of Sauron searching for the fellowship hiding under the many <em>ceilings</em> during their journey. The fourth and fifth primitives are the <em>mouth</em> of Gollum always mumbling “My preciousss”; and Pippin&#039;s <em>scarf</em>! Placement: the eye appears at the top similarly to how the Great Eye of Sauron is perched atop the Dark Tower.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 15-12-2007(137): In conjunction with <a href="../v4/837.html">send back</a> (#837 還)....... When I tried to give her the <em>jewel</em><strong> ring</strong>, she <em>eyed</em> me, threw it to the <em>floor</em>, opened her <em>mouth </em>and tried to speak, she said nothing. She grabbed her <em>scarf</em> and left.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saranich">saranich</a>] 19-11-2006(83): The Saudi woman accepted the marriage<strong> ring</strong>, though it meant lowering her eyes to the floor and covering her mouth with a scarf.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Es2Kay">Es2Kay</a>] 20-2-2011(38): There&#039;s no &quot;jewel&quot; in this kanji!! It&#039;s a &quot;king&quot; you idiots!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat">Spidercat</a>] 15-1-2008(26): The one<strong> ring</strong> is the <em>jewel</em> that the <em>eye</em> of Sauron, above the <em>ceiling</em> of his tower, is searching for. To get it back, Sauron sends his nazguls, whose insubstantial <em>mouths</em> are hidden behind a <em>scarf</em>.
