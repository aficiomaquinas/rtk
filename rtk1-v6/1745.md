1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 16-1-2008(261): A little <em>devil</em> at the <em>gates of hell</em><strong> review</strong>s your record to see if you&#039;re evil enough to get in.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 22-5-2007(37): As I was <strong>reviewing</strong> for my exam at a quiet saloon, the <em>devil</em> popped out of nowhere and offered to make sure I pass. But I told him no way, since that&#039;s cheating. Besides, I&#039;m just <strong>reviewing</strong> things I already know. I won&#039;t fail. But he kept insisting, so I kicked him and sent him crashing through the entrance <em>gates</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 20-8-2006(30): <em>Gates&#039;</em> IS the <em>devil</em>. He releases software that clearly hasn&#039;t gone through any kind of <em>review</em> process.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/furrykef">furrykef</a>] 29-6-2008(22): At the <em>gates</em> of Hell, the <em>Devil</em> greets you with his punishment: to<strong> review</strong> kanji flash cards for the rest of your life! (Not that I think anything is wrong with Heisig, but it does get tiring and I certainly wouldn&#039;t want to do it all my life. ;)).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 2-2-2009(13): At the Gates of Hell: &quot;What did I do to get here?&quot; you ask in disbelief. &quot;Well, let&#039;s<strong> review</strong>...&quot; says Satan.
