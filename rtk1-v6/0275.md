heisig: "Do not think of a &quot;gift&quot; here, but of the <b>present</b> moment, as distinct from the future and the past. The kanji gives us a <i>ball</i> in which we see the <b>present</b>&nbsp;- obviously a crystal <i>ball</i> that enables us to <i>see</i> things going on at the <b>present</b> in faraway places."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mimiko">mimiko</a>] 20-8-2007(176): <em>The KING</em> ... can <em>SEE</em> clearly the<strong> PRESENT</strong> state of affairs in the land. (maybe he hees them in the crystal ball on the left?).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indigo">indigo</a>] 4-1-2008(67): Hey, I want my money back! This crystal <em>ball</em> is out of order, I can <em>see</em> the<strong> present</strong> instead of the future!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lmcrtk">lmcrtk</a>] 10-4-2009(37): Many people claim that Elvis (The KING) has been SEEN walking around in the<strong> PRESENT</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lucianreign">lucianreign</a>] 6-12-2006(28): The king came...the king saw...thus, the king was<strong> present</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 29-10-2007(18): The palintir shows only what&#039;s happening NOW - the<strong> present</strong> - to the all-<em>see</em>ing eye of Sauron. Unfortunate overlap of keywords. I sometimes write 贈 <a href="../v4/503">presents</a> (#503 贈) when given this keyword for review.
