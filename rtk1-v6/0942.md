1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyland1">Hyland1</a>] 7-2-2007(294): The line of viking soldiers is always accompanied by a horn mending specialist.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 17-12-2007(163): I&#039;m <em>going</em> to<strong> accompany</strong> the <em>horny</em> girl to her room so I can &quot;mend&quot; her.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 11-11-2007(91): As you&#039;re <em>going</em> along someplace, you pause to <em>mend</em> a wounded <em>animal&#039;s horns</em>, and it decides to <em>go</em> with you, to<strong> accompany</strong> you as a pet/sidekick, out of gratitude.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 29-1-2009(72): Japanese Folklore:----------- <em>Mend</em> the <em>Horns</em> of an Oni, and he will<strong> accompany</strong> you on your travels, <em>Going</em> anywhere you choose.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 12-11-2008(23): The symbol on the right works well as Horny Repairman (mender) so you can imagine a porn character like a cable repairman that shows up at the door, and a beautiful girl answers (having seen the Big Lebowski helps with this visual). But instead of coming in, he asks the girl to<strong> accompany</strong> him to his van and she obeys and goes with him. &quot;obey&quot; is the primary meaning of this kanji so it&#039;s good to work it into the visual.
