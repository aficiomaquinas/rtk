heisig: "The <b>spinal column</b> has sprouted out of the <i>flesh</i> of your back into an <i>umbrella</i> that you always have with you, rain or shine. The pair of 2s on each side are the &quot;ribs&quot; of the <i>umbrella</i>. Take care to keep your image of the key word distinct from that for spine (Frame 24)."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 8-5-2007(71): &quot;Look&quot;, says the teacher in biology class. &quot;The<strong> spinal column</strong> holds your <em>flesh</em> together, just like the metal rod of this <em>umbrella</em> (he demonstrates this with an umbrella covered in <em>I-Ching</em> symbols) holds the umbrella together&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 27-4-2009(31): A pictograph of a<strong> spinal column</strong>. The <em>umbrella</em> representing the shoulder blades, the <em>I Ching</em> as the shoulder muscles and the <em>part of the body</em> as the spine itself.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FutureBlues">FutureBlues</a>] 6-10-2008(10): The<strong> spinal column</strong> functions in the same way the rod does in an <em>umbrella</em>... To hold one&#039;s <em>umbrella of flesh</em> together, much like the <em>I Ching</em> does for the universe.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 21-7-2009(8): In a horrific accident, a <em>body part</em> got <em>jammed in</em> the <em>grill</em> of my car: a<strong> spinal column</strong>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 28-1-2008(6): When my Korean girlfriend (from the I CHING symbols on the Korean flag) stands under an UMBRELLA and stretches her BODY, you can see the outline of her<strong> spinal column</strong>.
