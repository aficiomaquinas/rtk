primit: "tail feathers So as not to confuse this primitive element with the character for feathers, think of the extravagant tail-feather plumage of the peacock. The form itself is too pictographic to need breaking down further. [5]"
heisig: "This character rightly belongs to the previous lesson, but we held it until now because of the final element, the <i>tail feathers</i>. After the <i>drop</i> at the outset, the next three strokes are completely novel and should be given special attention."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 12-3-2008(392): In this kanji, you can see 3 katakana characters: ソ, ユ, and then ユ again followed by TAIL FEATHERS. STORY: &quot;So (ソ) you (ユ) wanna<strong> DO</strong> it?&quot; &quot;Only if you (ユ)<strong> do</strong>&quot; says the female bird as she raises her TAIL FEATHERS.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 12-10-2007(42): <strong>Do</strong> me <em>from</em> behind, says the bird, as she shakes her <em>tailfeathers</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alunalun">Alunalun</a>] 11-8-2009(20): Tell a story - a reluctant magician is asked to<strong> do</strong> a trick. The audience chant &#039;Do it,<strong> do</strong> it!&#039;, so eventually he<strong> do</strong>es one. He takes a <em>drop</em> of water (stroke 1), drops it on the ground where it runs<strong> do</strong>wn and smears out (stroke 2). It drops<strong> do</strong>wn two steps (strokes 3 and 4) (imagine some nice setting with steps), growing and becoming multicoloured, like a petrol drop, as it goes. Then at the bottom the magician touches it with his wand and you see it has turned into a set of peacock&#039;s <em>tail feathers</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavin.schultz-ohkubo">gavin.schultz-ohkubo</a>] 20-11-2010(12): The keyword &quot;do&quot; is just too generic for me, so I use &quot;<strong>for the sake of</strong>&quot;, which is perhaps a more common reading; for those familiar with the phrase ために, I believe this is the kanji for ため.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 18-1-2009(9): &quot;I <strong>do</strong>!&quot; says the bride before tripping over a <em>spear</em>, falling<strong> do</strong>wn the stairs and into the <em>flames</em>.
