heisig: "On the right we see the <i>moon</i> fading off into the first light of <b>morning</b>, and to the left, the <i>mist</i> that falls to give nature a shower to prepare it for the coming heat. If you can think of the <i>moon</i> tilting over to spill <i>mist</i> on your garden, you should have no trouble remembering which of all the elements in this story are to serve as primitives for constructing the character."
