1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 27-12-2006(239): Bonsais are grown in a house, away from the harsh<strong> reality</strong> of the real world where they wouldn&#039;t survive.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 12-12-2007(104): On this rather boring &#039;big brother&#039; type<strong> reality</strong> show, they have locked up <em>bonsai</em> inside a <em>house</em> and everyone is watching them on TV 24x7. The viewers have to vote on which bonsai shall remain in the house and which one has to leave.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 13-10-2006(27): (adapted from PepeSeco) In a new TV<strong> reality</strong> show called <em>bonsai</em> <em>house</em>, participants are challenged to grow the best bonsai. It takes years to make just one episode!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 7-6-2008(14): <em>Mr. Miyagi</em> is on a new<strong> reality</strong> TV show, <em>House of Miyagi</em>. 20 aspiring martial artists have to wash and clean an old house, while growing their own bonsai. Of course, their Bonsai don&#039;t come out very well, since they&#039;re novices. (I&#039;m trying to differentiate this bonsai from the rest of the ones we&#039;ve learned as being a messed up bonsai.. Notice the last stroke doesn&#039;t connect to the 2nd stroke of the kanji, but the 3rd instead.).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 1-7-2009(12): The<strong> reality</strong> is that most <em>bonsai</em> don&#039;t do well in the <em>house</em>.
