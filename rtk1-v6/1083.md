1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 30-12-2005(117): Referring to a scene in the movie &quot;The Matrix&quot; where a girl bends a spoon with the power of her mind alone, I imagine <em>Mister T</em> who<strong> change</strong>s a <em>spoon</em> into something else (maybe the waiter forgot to bring knives or forks). Note: as a primitive, it can help to use the image of &quot;spare<strong> change</strong>&quot;, this can help you keep it distinct from other similar kanji such as &quot;shape&quot; or &quot;turn into&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ezmoreldo">ezmoreldo</a>] 3-4-2008(95): I just see this one as a pictograph of a person changing position and sitting down.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 17-6-2007(64): <em>Mr. T</em> reaches into his wallet for some spare<strong> change</strong> but it has all<strong> change</strong>d into <em>spoons</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Valkyrie">Valkyrie</a>] 3-11-2008(32): MR. T can<strong> change</strong> a SPOON into a spork using only his teeth.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/partyrash">partyrash</a>] 22-1-2008(16): You&#039;d be a<strong> change</strong>d man if Chuck Norris spooned you!

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/diracbracket">diracbracket</a>] 22-7-2008(15): <em>Dracula</em> singing <strong>Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes</strong> in his bedroom like David Bowie, using a <em>spoon</em> as a pretend microphone. (By noting that he has no reflection in the spoon, we remember that it is him and not somebody else.) I use this as a David Bowie primitive.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/busaiku">busaiku</a>] 13-11-2009(11): <em>Mr. T</em> can<strong> change</strong> a <em>spoon</em> into a lethal weapon so don&#039;t make him angry!

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-9-2008(6): Forget bending the <em>spoon</em>, <em>Haruhi</em> will<strong> change</strong> it into something else entirely.
