heisig: "This character is best learned in connection with that of the previous frame. The first stroke shows a branch that is longer than the main branch, indicating that the tree has reached the <b>extremity</b> of its growth, so that its branches stop spreading and start drooping downwards. Be sure to keep this imagery in mind, to avoid confusing this key word with synonyms that will appear later."

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 8-4-2008(30): There are no great stories for this one yet, and I always forget it.. So, let&#039;s try something ridiculous: The man lived by himself in the wilderness, with no females within miles. So, his only way of relief was to stick his<strong> extremity</strong> into a small hole in a <em>tree</em>.. The poor guy. Which horizontal stroke is the<strong> extremity</strong>? The longer one or the shorter one? That, my friends, is up to your own imaginations. I&#039;d prefer not to dwell on that point, myself. ;).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/arthur">arthur</a>] 18-1-2009(9): It&#039;s near the upper<strong> extremity</strong> of the tree that grows the larger branches.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 31-7-2007(7): This character looks like &quot;not yet&quot; but the<strong> extremity</strong> of the first stroke protrudes over the second.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kimochinews">kimochinews</a>] 23-1-2008(4): 末 （すえ）- end; 年末 （ねんまつ）- end of the year.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Poncho">Poncho</a>] 10-8-2010(3): A <em>tree</em> ( 木 ) begins simple for it has <em>not yet</em> ( 未 ) reached its <em>extremity</em>( 末 ).

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jerseywonder">jerseywonder</a>] 18-12-2012(2): If that <em>tree</em> continues to stretch out its <strong>extremities</strong>, further and further, it might become top heavy and fall over soon!
