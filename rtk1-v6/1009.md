2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/broderickjeff">broderickjeff</a>] 29-1-2008(70): The <em>bamboo</em> part is easy. Just remember that this kanji refers to those particular <strong>bamboo hats</strong> that are worn primarily by Buddhist monks, who always seem to <em>stand</em> outside of train stations, collecting alms.
