1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 13-6-2007(64): I learned this one from the movie Evil Dead, but when it <em>grows late</em>, <em>trees</em> change shape and become<strong> spiny</strong> creatures! Lesson: don&#039;t go out at night.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gwindarr">Gwindarr</a>] 13-6-2008(15): As it grows late, Lakitu retires for the evening, leaving the<strong> spiny</strong>s to fend for themselves against Mario. Picture them jumping out of trees instead of being hurled from Lakitu. Lakitu - is the guy who flys the cloud in the Mario games...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(11): Usually the <em>tree</em> you bump into when it <em>grows late</em> happens to be<strong> spiny</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 27-10-2010(4): 梗概 , 梗塞 , 心筋梗塞 , 桔梗 , <a href="../v4/2498">spiny</a> (#2498 梗) コウ, キョウ ... Parts: 木 , 更 <a href="../v4/694">grow late</a> (#694 更) ... Story: Since this is used for infarction ( 梗塞 ), and myocardial infarction ( 心筋梗塞 ), the<strong> Spiny</strong> should tie into that. So when it <em>Grows Late</em> , and the old guy gets <em>Wood</em>, he has a <strong>myocardial infarction</strong> that feels like a<strong> Spiny</strong> monster grabbing his heart.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 10-3-2013(2): INFARCTION (new keyword, according to real meaning). If it GROWS LATE and you get an INFARCTION, have someone call an ambulance. In the meantime try to relax, stay under a TREE.
