1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 3-8-2008(103): The guy who was thrown into the river to sink was given one last request. &quot;If I&#039;m gonna be sleeping with the fishes,&quot; he said, &quot;can I at least have a<strong> pillow</strong>? I&#039;m real sensitive.&quot; The mafia bosses laughed. &quot;Look, my doctor said I can only use <em>wooden</em><strong> pillow</strong>s, I have a real serious condition. Can I at least die comfortable-like?&quot; The mafia dudes said fine, and let him have his<strong> pillow</strong>. They tossed him the river and drove off...and after a minute, he bobbed to the top, thanks to his floating <em>wood</em><strong> pillow</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 28-6-2010(38): WOODEN<strong> PILLOW</strong>S do not <a href="../v4/1888.html">sink</a> (#1888 沈) in water.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Corodon">Corodon</a>] 11-8-2009(20): (Mature audiences only) As my <em>wood</em> began to <em>sink</em> into her, she moaned into the <strong>pillow</strong>, not wanting to awaken the neighbors with screams of ecstasy.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 16-12-2009(7): Some Japanese people sleep with a<strong> pillow</strong> made of <em>wood</em>, in case there&#039;s a flood in the middle of the night. Because <strong>pillows</strong> made of <em>wood</em> do not <em>sink</em>, they need never fear falling asleep without a flotation device nearby.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch">NeoGlitch</a>] 15-11-2010(4): (Mature audiences only) As my <em>wood</em> began to <em>sink</em> into her, she moaned into the <strong>pillow</strong>, not wanting to awaken the neighbors with screams of... pain. It was her first time, and <strong>she wasn&#039;t wet!!</strong> (Thanks Corodon).
