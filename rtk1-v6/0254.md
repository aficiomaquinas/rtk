heisig: "Did you ever hear of the <i>turtle</i> who fell madly in love with a <i>chihuahua</i> but could not have her because their two families did not like the idea of their children intermarrying? Like all classic stories of ill-fated love, this one shows how the young upset the <b>status quo</b> with an emotion older and more powerful than anything their elders have devised to counter it: blind love."
