primit: "pent in(uwieziony w) This primitive depicts a corral or pen surrounding something, which is thus pent in. [3]"
heisig: "<i>Pent in</i> . . . <i>one</i>. The key word refers to famous sayings of famous people, and is the origin for the primitive meaning of <i>a tongue wagging in the mouth</i> that we learned in frame 12. The size of this kanji, a relatively rare one, is what distinguishes it from <i>day</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 17-2-2008(148): &quot;Sayeth&quot;?! Who the hell says &quot;sayeth&quot;? Doesn&#039;t seem quite right...just like this kanji, which is just like &quot;day&quot; but doesn&#039;t seem &quot;quite right.&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois">Francois</a>] 10-4-2008(87): When <em>pent up</em> alone, <em>one</em><strong> sayeth</strong> little.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/iheckman">iheckman</a>] 2-6-2008(45): So I don&#039;t mix with <a href="../v4/1117.html">speaketh</a> (#1117 申).<strong> Sayeth</strong> rhymes with dayeth.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/niktok">niktok</a>] 5-9-2007(22): So<strong> SAYETH</strong> we all. They are pent in on galactica, as one family.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shadolite">shadolite</a>] 27-3-2008(16): One pent up tongue<strong> sayeth</strong> little.
