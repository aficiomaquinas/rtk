heisig: "We know that the character for <i>large</i> takes on the meaning of the <i>St. Bernard</i> <b>dog</b> when used as a primitive. In this frame we finally see why. The <i>drop</i> added as a fourth and final stroke means that we have to do with a normal-sized <b>dog</b>, which compared to the <i>St. Bernard</i> is no more than a <i>drop</i> in the kennel."
primit: "As a primitive this character can take two meanings. In the form given here it will mean a very small dog (which we shall refer to as a chihuahua for convenience sake). When it takes the form t to the left of a character, we shall give it the meaning of a pack of wild dogs."

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 24-3-2008(17): If we remember <a href="../v4/107">large</a> (#107 大) as a man with his arms outstretched, the <strong>drop</strong> represents man&#039;s best friend - a<strong> dog</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cryonic">cryonic</a>] 2-1-2012(9): I don&#039;t know why not one single person before me has seemingly thought of this, but when I first encountered this character, it just seemed SO natural for me. It looks just exactly like a guy throwing a stick for his<strong> DOG</strong> to bring it back to him. Or am I really the only one seeing this picture?

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 8-10-2007(3): We already use most of this kanji as a primitive for<strong> dog</strong>. But a real<strong> dog</strong> has a drop of drool coming out of its mouth. (riffing off sutebun and CT).
