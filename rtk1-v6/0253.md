heisig: "We know that the character for <i>large</i> takes on the meaning of the <i>St. Bernard</i> <b>dog</b> when used as a primitive. In this frame we finally see why. The <i>drop</i> added as a fourth and final stroke means that we have to do with a normal-sized <b>dog</b>, which compared to the <i>St. Bernard</i> is no more than a <i>drop</i> in the kennel."
commen: "* As a primitive this character can take two meanings. In the form given here it will mean a very small dog (which we shall refer to as a <i>chihuahua</i> for convenience sake). When it takes the form 犭 to the left of a character, we shall give it the meaning of <i>a pack of wild dogs</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LucidFaia">LucidFaia</a>] 9-4-2008(76): A large<strong> dog</strong>, dripping drool.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal">captal</a>] 24-3-2008(17): If we remember <a href="../v4/107">large</a> (#107 大) as a man with his arms outstretched, the <strong>drop</strong> represents man&#039;s best friend - a<strong> dog</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/basch2020">basch2020</a>] 6-9-2009(13): An average<strong> dog</strong> is made to look like a little drop next to a St Bernard.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 31-7-2007(11): A LARGE ST. BERNARD<strong> DOG</strong> with a DROP of saliva.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cryonic">cryonic</a>] 2-1-2012(9): I don&#039;t know why not one single person before me has seemingly thought of this, but when I first encountered this character, it just seemed SO natural for me. It looks just exactly like a guy throwing a stick for his<strong> DOG</strong> to bring it back to him. Or am I really the only one seeing this picture?
