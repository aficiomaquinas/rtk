2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 29-4-2007(109): In a rare act of<strong> benevolence</strong>, the Sparten <em>column</em> removes the needle from the <em>cyclops&#039;s</em> eye, and he repays them by eating their <em>hearts</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 16-9-2008(93): <strong>Benevolence</strong>: <em>going</em> to help those who are unable to <em>listen</em> (i.e. have no ears).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-1-2006(27): A <em>heart</em> which was full of<strong> benevolence</strong>, but so small that it could pass through the <em>eye of a needle</em>, was displayed atop a huge Corinthian <em>column</em> (maybe the relic of some Saint). The <em>column</em> which acted as a stand, reminded viewers not to be fooled by the <em>heart</em>&#039;s <em>needle-eye</em> size.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kunzen">kunzen</a>] 16-1-2010(18): For<strong> benevolence</strong>, I think of the fable in which the mouse pulls the needle out of the lion&#039;s paw.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 3-8-2008(10): More than<strong> benevolence</strong>, this kanji means virtue: &quot; 徳 【とく】 (n) virtue&quot; Story: &quot;one virtue is to LISTEN to who your speaking to, not automatically GO against them and try to prove your own point.&quot;.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 15-2-2012(6): <strong>Benevolence</strong> means ones motives can <em>go</em> through the <em>eye of a needle</em> and to the bottom of the <em>heart</em>.
