1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 29-5-2007(136): Hearkening back to the kanji for LISTEN...<strong> Benevolence</strong> is a good <em>listener</em> who is willing to <em>go</em> the distance to help.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 29-4-2007(109): In a rare act of<strong> benevolence</strong>, the Sparten <em>column</em> removes the needle from the <em>cyclops&#039;s</em> eye, and he repays them by eating their <em>hearts</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 16-9-2008(93): <strong>Benevolence</strong>: <em>going</em> to help those who are unable to <em>listen</em> (i.e. have no ears).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/marydj">marydj</a>] 21-10-2007(40): Darth Vader was put in charge of the<strong> benevolence</strong> fund. He stands holding a bucket with a big heart on it as the column of soilders passes by. Everyone contributes.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-1-2006(27): A <em>heart</em> which was full of<strong> benevolence</strong>, but so small that it could pass through the <em>eye of a needle</em>, was displayed atop a huge Corinthian <em>column</em> (maybe the relic of some Saint). The <em>column</em> which acted as a stand, reminded viewers not to be fooled by the <em>heart</em>&#039;s <em>needle-eye</em> size.
