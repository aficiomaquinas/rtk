heisig: "Like several of the first characters we shall learn, the kanji for <b>mouth</b> is a clear pictograph. Since there are no circular shapes in the kanji, the square must be used to depict the circle."
commen: "* As a primitive, this form also means <i>mouth</i>. Any of the range of possible images that the word suggests - an opening or entrance to a cave, a river, a bottle, or even the largest hole in your head - can be used for the primitive meaning."
