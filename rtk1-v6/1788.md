1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet">sweetneet</a>] 27-9-2006(166): You can&#039;t expect weight loss to happen overnight. You should limit <em>going</em> to the <em>scale</em> to weigh yourself to once a day or once a week, in order to observe the anticipated weight loss<strong> gradually</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/slats70">slats70</a>] 10-1-2009(79): I set up a <em>column</em> chart next to my <em>scales</em> so I could record my weight<strong> gradually</strong> changing.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-9-2007(21): <em>Flash</em> didn&#039;t get fat overnight. He <strong>gradually</strong> added a pound on the <em>scale</em> here and there until finally he weighed <em>too much</em> to fit into his snazzy red costume. (Credit: CharleyGarrett).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scout">scout</a>] 11-2-2008(12): Ever since he&#039;s stopped doing Tours, <em>Lance</em> has been<strong> gradually</strong> gaining weight. See him cringe as he steps on a <em>scale</em> and sees it<strong> gradually</strong> go up!
