1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 8-1-2008(279): <strong>Animal sacrifice</strong> = taking the life of a cow.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 12-3-2007(71): In the 21st century,<strong> animal sacrifice</strong> is no longer really necessary. We can take a single cell from a cow, with no harm to the cow. We create a viable cell line from this single cell, and feed the resulting biomatter into a furnace at the exact rate necessary to appease the gods.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44">brian44</a>] 20-12-2007(20): The whole <em>life</em> of a <em>cow</em> is like one big long<strong> animal sacrifice</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Odieone">Odieone</a>] 5-1-2009(13): <em>Life</em> for a <em>cow</em> in India is pretty good. At least they would never be used as an animal scarifice.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 16-6-2008(13): There are two kanji that should be kept separate: <a href="../v4/643.html">sacrifice</a> (#643 犠) ( 義 ), and this one. Think of it this way: in 義 there is a <em>cow</em> and a <em>righteous</em> person (presumably a Hindu). One must be <strong>SACRIFICE</strong>d, so naturally the righteous Hindu took the place of the holy cow. But as the Hindu is no longer alive to protect the cow, so we will now take the <em>cow&#039;s life</em> in an <strong>animal sacrifice</strong>.
