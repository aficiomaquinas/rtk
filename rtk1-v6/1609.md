1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 18-10-2007(157): <em>Earthworm Jim&#039;s</em> prized possession is a<strong> genuine</strong> copy of the #1 issue of <em>Spiderman</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Piitaa">Piitaa</a>] 10-7-2006(120): You need to attach a<strong> genuine</strong> earthworm to the thread. With plastic bait you won&#039;t catch anything.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 9-5-2007(73): The real <em>Spiderman</em> loves to eat <em>earthworms</em>—they provide essential nutrients that make his threads stronger. So next time someone goes around claiming to be the real,<strong> genuine</strong> Spiderman, give him a few earthworms to eat.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hotkiller123">hotkiller123</a>] 15-4-2009(37): For remembering the primitive earthworm: <em>Drops of</em> rain were falling so I took my <em>shovel</em> to dig up some <strong>earthworms</strong> to put them on my <em>fishook</em>..... My story: To have a<strong> genuine</strong> fishing line you don&#039;t just pick up a stick but you also attach some<em> thread </em>onto it and at the end an <em>earthworm</em> must be hung.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 21-12-2008(32): <em>Earthworm Jim&#039;s</em> prized possession is a<strong> genuine</strong> copy of the #1 issue of <em>Spiderman</em>. And oddly enough, <em>Spiderman</em>&#039;s most prized possession is a<strong> genuine</strong> first edition of <em>Earthworm</em> Jim.
