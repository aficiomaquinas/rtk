1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laxxy">laxxy</a>] 3-10-2006(195): Press your ear to the gates and see if you can<strong> hear</strong> what is going on inside.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ambrokusa">ambrokusa</a>] 2-4-2007(50): To distinguish from listen, you<strong> hear</strong> someone at the door (gate).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Howdoken">Howdoken</a>] 11-5-2008(34): At the GATES of Hell, along with the mouth that asks the impossible questions there is of course a giant EAR to<strong> HEAR</strong> the answers. The ear doesn&#039;t really listen as it knows they will always be wrong.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-9-2008(15): The genius tells me to put my <em>ear</em> up to the <em>gates</em> in order to<strong> hear</strong> the <em>lesbians</em> better (see <a href="../v4/1623">closed</a> (#1623 閉).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joxn_costello">joxn_costello</a>] 5-2-2009(9): Your ears are the gates that allow you to<strong> hear</strong>. NOTE: You <a href="../v4/1626">hear</a> (#1626 聞) with your <em>ear</em> alone, but to <a href="../v4/827">listen</a> (#827 聴) you need to engage your <em>heart</em> as well.
