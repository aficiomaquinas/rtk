1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 17-6-2007(183): It is always <em>Mr. T</em>&#039;s<strong> responsibility</strong> to be the <em>porter</em> and carry around everyone&#039;s luggage because he&#039;s so strong.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 13-7-2008(67): In <a href="../v4/507.html">pregnancy</a> (#507 妊), the woman was the porter for the first nine months. Now, as a new father, <em>Mr.T</em> is assuming all the <strong>RESPONSIBILITIES</strong> that comes with it. Can&#039;t you just see him here as the new <em>porter</em>, wearing a harness with a his little dude (who already has a little matching mohawk)?

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 15-3-2007(23): <em>Mr. T</em> berates a lazy worker: &quot;Foo! You&#039;re a <em>porter</em>! It&#039;s your<strong> responsibility</strong> to carry bags, clean the bathroom, and stuff!&quot; To keep distinct from <a href="../v4/884.html">duty</a> (#884 役), consider a<strong> responsibility</strong> to come from without, rather than from within.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 24-3-2012(9): The <em>porter</em> of people (rather than of baggage -- i.e., bus driver, airline pilot, ...) is the <em>person</em> with the greatest responsibilty.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/etpan">etpan</a>] 22-10-2008(9): You can hire <em>Chuck Norris</em> to be your <em>porter</em> but he will take no<strong> responsibility</strong> if he damages your luggage while saving the world.
