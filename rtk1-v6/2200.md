You went too slow, browsed the forum too long, or stayed out too late with your Japanese girl/boyfriend, whilst I, Kanji Master (you may call me &#039;sir&#039;), sat alone in my room with a leaky pen and a clawed grip. All your kanji are belong to me, Heisig. And just remember; I beat you.

Add a +star to everybody here ^^.
