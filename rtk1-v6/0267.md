heisig: "As everyone knows, <b>tea</b> is made from <b>tea</b> leaves. But the <b>tea</b> plant itself has its own <i>flowers</i>, which can be quite beautiful and add a special flavor to the <i>tea</i>, as the Chinese found out already over 4,598 years ago. With the image of a terrace of <i>flowering</i> <b>tea</b> bushes in mind, picture a number of brightly painted and very l-o-n-g <i>wooden poles</i> (Frame 207) placed here and there in their midst, with a tiny <i>umbrella</i> at the top to shade the delicate-tasting <b>tea</b> <i>flowers</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wreckz">wreckz</a>] 21-1-2008(214): Some people think drinking<strong> tea</strong> is boring and quaint. That&#039;s why I spice mine up by adding a cocktail umbrella, which of course is made from a <em>wood</em>-en toothpick supporting a paper <em>umbrella</em> with <em>flowers</em> printed on top.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps">ceeeps</a>] 13-9-2007(92): When I drink <em>herbal</em><strong> tea</strong> I like to drink it under a <em>parasol</em>. If it&#039;s too hot I go &quot;ho, ho, ho !!&quot; (katakana ホ).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gsantise">gsantise</a>] 26-8-2007(39): <strong>Tea</strong> is made from <em>flowers</em> dried under a <em>canopy</em> held up with <em>wooden poles</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/activeaero">activeaero</a>] 20-8-2008(30): The &quot;flowers&quot; of the &quot;umbrella tree&quot; make the best<strong> TEA</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ChieShorts">ChieShorts</a>] 23-2-2012(18): That sexy ho (ホ) under the flowery umbrella is just my cup of<strong> tea</strong>.
