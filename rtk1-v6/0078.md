heisig: "Here is the full kanji on which the last frame is based. If you can think of a table full of carpenter's <b>tools</b> of all sorts, each equipped with its own <i>eye</i> so that it can keep a watch over what you are doing with it, you won't have trouble later keeping the primitive and the kanji apart."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rinifett">Rinifett</a>] 25-9-2007(200): Keep an eye on your<strong> tool</strong>s while you work at the table.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 27-8-2007(107): One<strong> tool</strong> nobody should be without - a Mordor-type eye that floats over the workbench. It jerks around, monitoring all who come near, and if anyone so much as removes a stapler from the bench - ZAP.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alimasag">alimasag</a>] 28-10-2007(83): You need a strong<strong> tool</strong> to remove the legs from a shellfish.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonmayes">jonmayes</a>] 11-7-2008(26): You need a strong a<strong> tool</strong> to separate the legs from a shellfish.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wreckz">wreckz</a>] 23-1-2008(19): Like my shop teacher always said... In order to use any<strong> tool</strong> at your <em>workbench</em> you must first make sure to wear your safety goggles to protect your <em>eyes</em>.
