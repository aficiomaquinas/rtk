1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 28-5-2007(309): Forgetting about the moat, the king stepped out of his gate and landed in the water. Needless to say he got<strong> wet</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nyquil">nyquil</a>] 10-4-2007(87): (I had the same idea as Dingomick) I imagine some prankster who put a bucket full of <em>water</em> on top of the huge <em>gates</em>, so that it would fall on the <em>king</em> as he came through them. See the king now, between the gates, all<strong> wet</strong>, dripping <em>drops of water</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-9-2008(26): If I was <em>king</em>, I would be<strong> wet</strong> with the <em>water</em> of <em>lesbians</em> rubbing all over me.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 6-3-2007(21): Some prankster threw <em>water</em> on the <em>king</em> as he came to the city gates. Now he&#039;s all <strong>wet</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Airymon">Airymon</a>] 25-4-2008(13): I immediately thought of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Imagine <em>King</em> Arthur standing in front of the <em>gate</em> shortly before the end of the movie. When he demands to be let in by the French, they throw dung on him and Belvedere and they get<strong> wet</strong>. (Think of the dung as <em>water</em> in this case, it&#039;s liquid anyway) <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=9V7zbWNznbs">http://youtube.com/watch?v=9V7zbWNznbs</a> The scene I thought of is at the end of the vid.
