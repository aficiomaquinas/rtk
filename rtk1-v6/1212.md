1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ithil">ithil</a>] 2-11-2006(229): A two-hour lesson of<strong> philosophy</strong> in high school. All the students, bored to death, are <em>folding</em> sheets of paper into planes, love notes or whatever, while the <em>mouth</em> of the teacher is talking about Platon, Kierkegaard and many other notorious philosophers.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jwy2k2">jwy2k2</a>] 19-5-2007(88): I fold my mouth, therefore I am.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 17-11-2007(50): All the<strong> philosophy</strong> that comes out of my <em>mouth</em> I learned from those Chinese fortune cookies with the <em>folded</em> paper inside. &#039;Confucius say...&#039;, et cetera. Come to think of it, the cookie itself looks like a weirdly <em>folded mouth</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xxinde">xxinde</a>] 7-5-2010(41): This friend of mine once unknowingly popped the whole fortune cookie into his <em>mouth</em>. Then using his <em>fingers</em> he retrieved a <em>folded</em> piece of paper. And it was the only time some<strong> philosophy</strong> came out of his <em>mouth</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sindhikara">sindhikara</a>] 3-12-2008(27): Here&#039;s a philosophical question: Can you <em>fold</em> a <em>hole</em>?
