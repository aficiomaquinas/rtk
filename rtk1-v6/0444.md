1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 10-6-2006(166): First, note that the top half of the kanji consists of <em>one</em> and <em>mountain</em>. Of course, the &quot;<em>number 1</em>&quot; <em>mountain</em> in Japan is <em>Mt.</em> Fuji. The bottom half, under <em>Mt.</em> Fuji, consists of <em>crown</em> and <em>towel</em>. Now for the story. Archaeologists digging under <em>Mt.</em> Fuji (Japan&#039;s <em>#1</em> <em>mountain</em>) in an ancient royal tomb (they know it&#039;s royal because of the <em>crown</em>) discover what looks like a <em>towel</em>, but after they clean it up, they see it is actually a splendid royal <em>sash</em> for the king&#039;s kimono.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 28-3-2009(160): WARNING: Try to avoid thinking of the upper element as a combination of <em>one</em> and <em>mountain</em>, because in this case you will get used to the incorrect stroke order.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 15-10-2007(56): Beautiful &quot;Miss Housewife Japan&quot; is on posters everywhere, cooking right before Mt. Fuji (the <em>number one</em> <em>mountain</em>) while wearing nothing but her crown, and an <em>apron</em> tied with a<strong> sash</strong>. (hodgepodge of mspertus, zwarte_kat, et al, with a jot of hadaka apron to focus the image.).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 17-10-2011(54): The <em>buckle</em> is on the<strong> sash</strong> of the <em>apron</em>. (Note that according to the dictionary, breaking down this Kanji includes only the radicals for &quot;walking stick&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, &quot;crown&quot; and &quot;towel&quot;. Hence, &quot;mountain&quot; is not part of the radicals.).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/deedriod">deedriod</a>] 5-5-2012(30): Heisig fails to go into detail about the top kanji, but, It&#039;s not a mountain like everyone is saying. It actually means <em>Thirty</em> 丗 the stroke order starts with a <em>One</em>, then draw in the three vertical lines from left to right. Then the last stroke at the bottom closing it up. Then comes the <em>Apron</em> which makes up a<strong> Sash</strong>. (-Story: I made a<strong> Sash</strong> out of <em>Thirty</em> cut up <em>Aprons</em>.
