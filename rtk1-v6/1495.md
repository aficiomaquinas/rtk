1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 2-9-2007(201): The <em>prefecture</em> has <strong>suspend</strong>ed all <em>DNA</em> research for <em>heart</em> disease because of corruption. All involved will be <strong>suspend</strong>ed by their wrists.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus">mattimus</a>] 12-1-2010(95): In a very racist <em>prefecture</em> of Japan, they screen everyone&#039;s <em>DNA</em>. If they find out you are of a different <em>lineage</em>, they rip out your <em>heart</em> and<strong> suspend</strong> it in the Hall of Shame.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/szreter">szreter</a>] 23-6-2008(47): Hint:<strong> suspend</strong> as in hang up.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog">guidedog</a>] 11-9-2007(39): The prefecture has<strong> suspend</strong>ed all research into inheritable (lineage) heart disease.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 19-7-2009(38): <strong>Suspend</strong>ed in the middle of the <em>prefecture</em> is a chart of the area&#039;s <em>lineage</em>. But, since this is Japan, it has to be cute, so the chart has been covered with little <em>hearts</em>.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 23-9-2008(17): The <em>prefecture</em><strong> suspend</strong>ed <em>heart</em> transplants in order to maintain pure <em>lineages</em>.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb">jameserb</a>] 30-5-2008(17): In that prefecture they have a custom of<strong> suspend</strong>ing small hearts over their front doors with strings of yarn as a welcome sign.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/karmatheif">karmatheif</a>] 19-3-2009(16): Joke: Why can&#039;t anyone solve murder cases in Alabama? Cause nobody has any teeth for dental records, and everyone has the same DNA. For this one I imagine a police case being <strong>suspended</strong> in a certain <em>prefecture</em> because everyone is from the same family <em>(DNA)</em> and shares the same <em>heart</em> (i.e. they all feel the same way and therefore all have a motive) RTK2:　ケン 懸賞 けんしょう(reward)…　Pure Group(ｹﾝ): 県 513 ケ 懸念 けねん　(anxiety).

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/myglagata">myglagata</a>] 14-4-2009(10): This is in &quot;with all your effort&quot; （ 一所懸命 いっしょけんめい）. The <em>prefectural</em> office worked really hard to<strong> suspend</strong> cultural artefacts around their workplace; a <em>DNA helix</em> as a reminder of Japanese lineage, and a <em>heart</em> cushion below it as a reminder of Japanese kindness and hospitality.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/delbertmon">delbertmon</a>] 3-1-2010(9): When you go to the hospital in my prefecture ( 福岡 <em>県</em>), they hang (<strong>suspend</strong>) your medical records (<em>lineage/DNA</em> charts) outside your room for the doctor&#039;s to study and assess your chances of <em>heart</em> disease based on your <em>lineage/DNA</em>.
