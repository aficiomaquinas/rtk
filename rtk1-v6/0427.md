heisig: "The right half of this character shows a <i>garment</i> woven so fine that it can pass through the <i>eye</i> of a <i>needle</i>, fittingly draped around the slithering, ethereal form of a poltergeist. In this frame, our eerie visitor brushes its robes against a nearby block of apartments and completely <b>demolishes</b> them, razing them to the <i>ground</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sannomiya">sannomiya</a>] 3-5-2007(410): If you stand too close to a<strong> DEMOLITION</strong> site, the dust might sting you like NEEDLES in your EYE and get your GARMENTs all dirty.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rakushun">Rakushun</a>] 16-10-2007(108): Since that needle eye thing turns up a lot, I turned it into Darth Vader. It kinda looks like him to me, with the eye being his metal mouth piece thing. So, Darth Vader swings his cape (his garment) demolishing a nearby building, leaving nothing but a pile of dirt.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lukearns">lukearns</a>] 2-4-2008(51): During<strong> demolition</strong>, <em>dirt</em> and debris can feel like <em>needles in your eyes</em> if you&#039;re not wearing ther proper <em>garments</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eightyd">eightyd</a>] 8-7-2009(16): The dirt to the left is all that remains of the WTC on 9/11. On the right we have george bush wearing a perfectly clean and expensive suit/garment putting eyedrops in his eye to force an emotion over the victims of 9/11. He has to fake this emotion since 9/11 was a controlled<strong> demolition</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ew8049">ew8049</a>] 29-6-2008(15): The<strong> demolition</strong> expert doesn&#039;t want DIRT in his 10 EYES, so he covers them with a SCARF.
