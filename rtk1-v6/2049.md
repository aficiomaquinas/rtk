heisig: "The <i>flower</i> at the top and the <i>floor</i> with the <i>oven fire</i> beneath are familiar. The problem is what comes in between. It is formed by the character for <i>complete</i>, whose vertical stroke doubles up as the first stroke of <i>water</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 31-12-2005(181): This kanji is used in compounds for the<strong> steam</strong>ing of food and also for smoking/fumigation. Here we have the Japanese once again trying to replicate the French cuisine, only with a twist,<strong> steam</strong>ing food with flowers (think of flower-smoked ham for example). Flowers must first be <em>completely soaked in water</em>, and then poured over a thin piece of <em>flooring</em> under which there is an <em>oven fire</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 25-3-2008(136): Note: <em>complete + water + floor</em> are later combined into 丞 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2919">helping hand</a> (#2919 丞). Story: The driver of a<strong> steam</strong> train asks you for a <em>helping hand</em> and explains that your job is to throw <em>flowers</em> on the <em>fire</em> to make the<strong> steam</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 14-10-2009(63): (EASY KANJI!) At the top we see hot<strong> steam</strong> forming FLOWERS. At the bottom we see the STOVE FIRE heating the bottom of a pan. So what&#039;s in the middle causing all this<strong> steam</strong>? Its all COMPLETELY WATER.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 28-4-2008(31): I keep forgetting this primitive, so <em>completely</em>/<em>water</em> for me will be a sort of <em>water sprite</em> or elemental, a <em>child-like</em> creature <em>completely</em> made of <em>water</em>. -------- It used to be thought that to create<strong> steam</strong>, you had to trap the <em>water sprite</em> (using some sort of magical <em>flowers</em> as a lure), and place them over a thin piece of <em>flooring</em> under which there&#039;s an <em>oven fire</em>. The<strong> steam</strong> then <em>flowers</em> from the <em>water sprite</em> (re: fuaburisu).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 10-12-2006(16): When you want to<strong> steam</strong> some <em>flowers/vegetation</em> you don&#039;t cover them <em>completely</em> with <em>water</em>, rather you have just a little at the <em>floor</em> of the saucepan and then <em>heat</em>.
