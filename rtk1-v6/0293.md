heisig: "Take <b>inscription</b> in the sense of the <i>name</i> you ask the jeweler to carve on a <i>gold</i> bracelet or inside a <i>gold</i> ring to identify its owner or communicate some sentimental message. It will help if you can recall the first time you had this done and the feelings you had at the time."

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo">NooNoo</a>] 28-4-2008(35): I imagine ancient Egyptian<strong> inscription</strong>s: Pharaohs&#039; <em>names</em> written in <em>gold</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skellyfish">skellyfish</a>] 15-12-2008(7): If you&#039;ve got some METAL and you want to put a NAME on it, you&#039;ve got no choice but to use an<strong> inscription</strong> - everything else will rub off or fail to stick in the first place. (Imagine a bunch of people trying to write on metal with pencils, pens, etc. and then one guy with a Eureka moment thinking of<strong> inscription</strong>).
