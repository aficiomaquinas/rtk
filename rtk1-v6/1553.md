1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 31-1-2008(189): The <em>samurai</em> sitting on the <em>drum</em> is on a stage, and the people below him are <strong>rejoicing</strong> with their <em>mouths</em> in unison. It helps me to imagine the placement this way.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 13-3-2007(59): <strong>Rejoice</strong> with the sound of <em>drums</em> and <em>voice</em>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 5-9-2006(42): In the taiko (<a href="../v4/1444.html">drum</a> (#1444 鼓)) song of rejoicing, the drummers shout with open mouths.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tummai">tummai</a>] 30-5-2008(30): <em>Ten</em> <em>beans</em> in my <em>mouth</em>! I was starving so this small meal is enough for me to<strong> rejoice</strong>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 3-8-2008(23): Think Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Sir Robin&#039;s ministrals, following the group with their <em>drums</em>: &quot;One winter they had to eat (therefore the mouth) Robin&#039;s ministrals... and there was much <strong>rejoicing</strong>.
