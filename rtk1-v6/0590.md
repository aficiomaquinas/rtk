1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 10-4-2007(268): The<strong> fresh</strong>est <em>fish</em> is caught in the middle of the night while most people are &quot;counting <em>sheep</em>.&quot; (If you&#039;ve ever been to Tsukiji fish market, you know what I mean).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Bullfrog">Bullfrog</a>] 27-6-2009(222): This one&#039;s easy to remember. The kanji gives 2 examples of foods that should be purchased<strong> fresh</strong>. To remember which foods, take the first letter of<strong> fresh</strong>, &quot;F&quot;, to stand for fish and the final sound of<strong> fresh</strong>, &quot;SH&quot;, to stand for sheep:<strong> FreSH</strong>. It even puts the primitives in the right order.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 11-10-2005(31): There was a fisherman living near the coast, who was also raising <em>sheep</em>. One of his <em>sheep</em> once died after eating not-so-fresh <em>fish</em>, and since then, the fisherman&#039;s been feeding his <em>sheep</em> with<strong> fresh</strong> <em>fish</em>. -- &quot;fresh fish for the <em>sheep</em>&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 14-10-2009(29): I like my FISH &#039;n&#039; SHEEPS (chips)<strong> FRESH</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sheetz">sheetz</a>] 11-7-2007(16): To keep your fish<strong> fresh</strong>, wrap them up in sheepskins.
