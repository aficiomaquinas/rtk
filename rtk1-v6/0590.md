The kanji gives 2 examples of foods that should be purchased<strong> fresh</strong>. To remember which foods, take the first letter of<strong> fresh</strong>, &quot;F&quot;, to stand for fish and the final sound of<strong> fresh</strong>, &quot;SH&quot;, to stand for sheep:<strong> FreSH</strong>. It even puts the primitives in the right order.
