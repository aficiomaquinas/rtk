1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sannomiya">sannomiya</a>] 6-5-2007(147): The<strong> MONKEY</strong> likes to play hide and seek with the PACK of WILD DOGS by hiding in the LIDDED CROCK. But he is easy to see because the SCARF he always wears is at the base of the LIDDED CROCK.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 25-2-2007(129): To catch a <strong>monkey</strong>, chase him with <em>wild dogs</em> into a <em>lidded crock</em>, then tie it with a <em>scarf</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koiulpoi">koiulpoi</a>] 21-6-2009(77): Honestly, I hate the &quot;Lidded Crock with a scarf&quot; metaphor. It makes no sense, and I just can&#039;t get an image that &quot;sticks&quot; with it, at all. Besides, it sounds retarded. The original meaning of the whole right side of this Kanji is &quot;Long Kimono.&quot; So, put a wild dog in a kimono, stand him on two legs, and you&#039;ve got something that looks like a man but still feral - a<strong> monkey</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Supraman">Supraman</a>] 15-11-2010(18): We should be starring the 2009-- stories, The 2006--2007 stories totally have a monopoly. GIVE THE NEW GUYS A CHANCE! ;) All you new guys star this.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mickymay">mickymay</a>] 1-5-2011(13): The upper right part means long kimono. 袁 is not in Heisig list, but if you remember it, you have an easier time later on. &quot;Long kimono&quot; is easier than &quot;lidded crock with scarf.&quot; For its story look at Kanji 34945. Story for 猿 : If you put wild dogs in long kimonos, they look like<strong> monkey</strong> really.
