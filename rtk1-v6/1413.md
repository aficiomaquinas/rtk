1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 28-8-2007(249): A black<strong> hole</strong> is a &quot;House of Infinity&quot;. Infinity is of course represented by a sideways &quot;8&quot;, but here we have a Japanese &quot;8&quot; instead.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zz_alex_zz">zz_alex_zz</a>] 19-2-2008(105): Billiards anyone? <em>House</em> rules here state that the first person to pot the <em>eight</em> ball into the <strong>hole</strong> wins the game.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/montecristo73">montecristo73</a>] 20-7-2009(20): What good is it to buy a house with 8<strong> hole</strong>s in the ceiling? (The kanji for 8 also looks like water flowing from the ceiling.).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 15-8-2006(15): I think of people playing on a mini golf course. One player is frustrated because the ball got stuck into a <em>house</em> (a small building decoration), and ends up doing a &quot;hole-in-<em>eight</em>&quot; instead of a<strong> hole</strong>-in-one.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jackhuddleston">jackhuddleston</a>] 19-5-2008(11): I came home one day to find that termites had <em>eight</em> my entire <em>house</em>... nothing but a<strong> hole</strong> left.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 23-3-2008(10): What the hell? This house has 8<strong> hole</strong>s in it! I&#039;m not buying it.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 8-3-2010(9): In your <em>house</em>, your wife spreads her legs (the bottom part of the kanji) for you. The space between the legs is her &quot;hole&quot;.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nijuro">Nijuro</a>] 18-7-2010(6): I <em>eight</em> a<strong> hole</strong> in your <em>house</em>! Ahh? Ahh?

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavin.schultz-ohkubo">gavin.schultz-ohkubo</a>] 4-6-2010(6): I too like the idea of using <em>Paris Hilton</em> as the primitive for this, but more for the connotations of emptiness than anything sexual. House at the top to represent her as the heiress to the huge hotel (<em>house</em>) chain, and human legs because people are more interested in that than in anything coming from her head.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/karma42RTK">karma42RTK</a>] 5-3-2010(5): A<strong> HOLE</strong> is HOUSE for something creepy with EIGHT animal legs.
