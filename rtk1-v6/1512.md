1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura">vosmiura</a>] 20-11-2007(169): The winner of the long<strong> jump</strong> competition was disqualified when they found he used a <em>pogo stick</em> tied to his <em>leg</em> to<strong> jump</strong> further.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 7-11-2009(106): The high <strong>jump</strong>er has his <em>wooden leg</em> fitted with a <em>pogo stick</em>, and can now<strong> jump</strong> even higher. (See my note at <a href="../v4/1408.html">traffic</a> (#1408 通) for <em>pogo stick</em>). EDIT (2 years later): Keyword &quot;jump&quot; leads to confusion later on (see cjon256&#039;s post), <strong>&quot;Dancing&quot;</strong> would be better (but be sure to keep it distinct from <a href="../v4/1774.html">dance</a> (#1774 舞)). New Story: I was no good at <strong>dancing</strong> due to my <em>wooden leg</em>... until I had it fitted with a <em>pogo stick</em>!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256">cjon256</a>] 27-6-2006(54): This is totally wrong. It doesn&#039;t mean &quot;jump&quot;, it means &quot;dance&quot;! 踊 <a href="../v4/1409.html">jump</a> (#1409 踊) and 曜 <a href="../v4/1285.html">leap</a> (#1285 躍) are homonyms, so it is easy to become permanently confused about which one DOES NOT mean &quot;jump/leap&quot;. Caveat Lector! Note: 舞 <a href="../v4/1774.html">dance</a> (#1774 舞) is quite a bit rarer (and not a homonym).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 29-4-2009(40): Heisig is triiippppiiiin&#039;. This means dance, not<strong> jump</strong>. I named the other &quot;dance&quot; kanji &quot;interpretive dance&quot; because it is used in all sorts of concepts figuratively related to dance, like stages, fluttering, etc. One of my<em> legs is wooden</em>, the other is a <em>pogo stick</em>. Surprisingly, I&#039;m actually a pretty good at <strong>dancing</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shizuru">Shizuru</a>] 27-8-2007(19): My wooden leg has a chop-seal at the end, but I have to<strong> jump</strong> so as to utilize it (so the chop-seal hits the right spot from above).
