1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 22-2-2007(262): TSA guard: <em>What&#039;s</em> in the <strong>baggage</strong>?! It&#039;s just <em>flowers</em>, I swear!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 1-11-2007(85): Your girlfriend arrives at the airport. You give her <em>flowers</em>, but she brushes you off and says &quot;here, carry my<strong> BAGGAGE</strong>.&quot; Dumbfounded at her rudeness, you say, &quot;<em>what</em>?&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/msukovich">msukovich</a>] 7-5-2008(51): Customs agent: &quot;<em>What</em> kind of <em>flowers</em> are these in your <strong>baggage</strong>, sir? Poppies, huh? Please come with us, sir...&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rptb1">rptb1</a>] 11-11-2005(26): A man walks through airport security with a big piece of<strong> baggage</strong>. The sniffer dogs go bezerk! &quot;What&#039;s in the bag?&quot; yell the guards. But when they open the bag they just find it&#039;s full of flowers.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 31-3-2006(12): My story is similar to rptb1, only that the<strong> baggage</strong> is extremely heavy, and when the guards open it they see flowers and say &quot;<em>What</em> kind of <em>flowers</em> is that !?&quot; (you would never imagine flowers would make<strong> baggage</strong> this heavy).
