1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 3-5-2007(188): There&#039;s a buyback program where you can<strong> trade</strong> in your <em>dagger</em> for <em>money</em>. But it&#039;s quite ineffective, since only registered dagger-owners with the <em>original receipts</em> can participate, and not criminals with illegally-purchased daggers.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 8-11-2007(74): The new RANSOM note (a receipt stuck to a door with a dagger) from DETAIN (1423) appears again (probably after you went to the field as instructed) now gives instruction to<strong> TRADE</strong> the victim for CURRENCY you were told to bring.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Proxx">Proxx</a>] 4-2-2008(51): Here is my <em>receipt</em> and here is my <em>dagger</em>. Now give me my <em>money</em> back! Isn&#039;t that a fair<strong> trade</strong>?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andresito">andresito</a>] 17-5-2009(22): A fair<strong> trade</strong> means some <em>shells</em> (money) and a <em>receipt</em>. An unfair<strong> trade</strong> (robbery) means a <em>dagger</em> and no <em>receipt</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 26-3-2007(12): [trade; exchange] The ancient tools-of-the-<strong>trade</strong> for trading are: <em>receipts</em>, <em>shells</em> and a <em>dagger</em> (to persuade a trading part that refuses to give the first or the second).
