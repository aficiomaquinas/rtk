1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau23">dilandau23</a>] 5-11-2006(228): Children going around the<strong> mulberry</strong> <em>tree</em> singing &quot;This is the way we wash our <em>crotch</em>, wash our <em>crotch</em>, wash our <em>crotch</em>...&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 1-11-2007(97): Imagine kids <em>all over</em> the top of a<strong> mulberry</strong> <em>tree</em>, sitting astride limbs so that their weight is on their <em>crotches</em>. (Mulberry trees have big sprawling limbs that run horizontally or at shallow angles making them easy to climb and sit in. I have an old<strong> mulberry</strong> in my yard, and my kids are in it constantly).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy">howdycowdy</a>] 2-4-2008(37): According to Wikipedia, &quot;unripe [MULBERRY] fruit and green parts of the plant have a white sap that is intoxicating and mildly hallucinogenic.&quot; When looking at the<strong> MULBERRY</strong> <em>tree</em>, some have hallucinated that they are seeing <em>crotches, crotches everywhere</em>!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/strider62590">strider62590</a>] 9-7-2009(21): Mulberries taste like crotch. This is a pictograph of the crotchberry tree. Look at all the ripe berries up top!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 12-12-2008(13): Do you see the three students <em>sitting cross-legged</em> on the <em>tree</em> eating<strong> mulberry</strong>?
