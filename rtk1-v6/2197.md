1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 25-5-2006(117): Pictograph of a stanchion, which includes two vertical posts to restrain cows so they can be milked, with a horizontal stroke showing the number of cows per stanchion: one. A stanchion is a great symbol for the<strong> SIGN OF THE COW</strong>, since modern, domesticated cows are often stanchioned in barns.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 11-3-2008(106): 77 cows behind a fence.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 15-4-2007(68): There&#039;s no<strong> sign of the cow</strong>. She saw those <em>daggers</em> – <em>two</em> of them – and ran off.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/furrykef">furrykef</a>] 9-7-2008(48): (Slight adjustment of raseru&#039;s story.) You pull out two 二 daggers 刀 and carve this<strong> sign of the cow</strong> into the poor cow. Hint: imagine using the two daggers in place of a branding iron to brand the cow. The stroke order is the same as &quot;dagger, two&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 21-7-2009(21): No<strong> sign of the cow</strong>, because the <em>7 Samurai</em> ate her.
