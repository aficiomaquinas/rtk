heisig: "This character obliges us once again to make use of a Japanese key word for want of an English equivalent. It refers to an old unit of weight, equal to about 3.75 grams. The word is only slightly more useful in modern Japanese than cubits and kites are in modern English. Its primitives, if you look closely, are: <i>bound up</i> . . . <i>arm</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 2-9-2006(270): &quot;Dude! What happened to your arm! It&#039;s all bound up!&quot; &quot;Yeah man, it&#039;s a bummer... with my arm like this I can only lift one<strong> monme</strong>!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 3-12-2007(57): &quot;Dude! What happened to your arm! It&#039;s all bound up!&quot; &quot;Yeah man, it&#039;s a bummer... with my arm like this I can only lift one<strong> monme</strong>!&quot; &quot;You&#039;ll never be able to use your dagger now!&quot; (adapted from ergerg).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ikeda_kat2007">Ikeda_kat2007</a>] 31-12-2007(52): In Jamaica: Hey <strong>mon, may</strong> I have some (3.75 grams to be exact) uh dat leaf? I need it fo medical reasons. Look at my bound up arm!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sindhikara">sindhikara</a>] 2-12-2008(37): Either Heisig or the person who put this on the list is an asshole. Most JP people have never seen it. Heisig admits is useless. I hope his arms get bound up by the police for carrying a<strong> monme</strong> of crack.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 24-9-2007(34): Very difficult to picture, however, a<strong> MONME</strong> is very light, only 3.75 grams. So, imagine your BOUND UP sore ARM. Now imagine the weight of the cloth that BOUND UP your ARM. Yep, you guessed it. It weighs one<strong> MONME</strong>.
