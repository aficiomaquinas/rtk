1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 24-8-2006(213): &quot;Indy, my friend, you must be very careful! If you approach the <strong>altar</strong> and do not give the proper <em>salutation</em> a large <strong>fishhook</strong> will rip you away&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 15-9-2007(103): You should <em>fish hook</em> (bend/bow) your body before an <em>altar</em> as a form of<strong> salutation</strong> to God/gods.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 8-10-2007(54): <strong>SALUTATION</strong> (a hand salute in this case) was given to the ALTAR by a veteran with a HOOK for his hand. Just keep that mental picture and you own this kanji.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 21-7-2008(20): This cult has a really dumb<strong> salutation</strong>. They form sort of a <em>&#039;fishhook&#039;</em> on their foreheads with their thumb and index finger. They do it whenever they come near the <em>altar</em>. They say it&#039;s &#039;L&#039; for &#039;Luck&#039;, I say it&#039;s &#039;L&#039; for &#039;Losers&#039;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 19-6-2007(11): Salute the church <em>altar</em> with a bow (bend yourself like a <em>fishhook</em>).
