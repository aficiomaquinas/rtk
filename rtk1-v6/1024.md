1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 27-11-2008(177): Mr T&#039;s<strong> assistant</strong> is on his left. Why? Because Mr T has this bad habit of suddenly extending his right arm (what with all the boxing that he did), and his<strong> assistant</strong> got inadvertently punched in the face more than once (ouch). So now his<strong> assistant</strong> is always to his left side, much safer - &quot;Stay on my <em>left</em>, foo!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 9-5-2007(84): On your right is your &quot;right-hand man&quot; that you credit for all your success....on the left...... is your<strong> assistant</strong> who does all the grunt work and gets no credit for anything...

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 24-4-2008(35): Your left-hand man. (NB this kanji suggests a lower-ranking<strong> assistant</strong>. Their is a similar but rarer kanji 佑 with &quot;right&quot; that indicates receiving help from a superior.).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stryder">Stryder</a>] 30-11-2007(13): <em>Dwight Schrute</em> wants to be Michael Scott&#039;s right-hand man (<strong>Assistant</strong> Regional Manager) but the best he ever manages is his <em>left</em>-hand man (<strong>Assistant</strong> TO the Regional Manager).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/somukeru">somukeru</a>] 6-3-2008(12): As Obi-wan&#039;s padawan, or<strong> assistant</strong>, Anakin is the <em>Jedi</em> who stands on his <em>left</em>.
