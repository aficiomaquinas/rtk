1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 1-7-2006(347): Sticking a<strong> plug up</strong> your hole will lead to stronger climaxes.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Captain+Kanjipants">Captain+Kanjipants</a>] 7-8-2011(187): I&#039;m pretty sure Heisig wrote the whole book just so he could make this joke.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44">brian44</a>] 6-12-2007(102): Here we have a Hole and Climax to mean<strong> PLUG UP</strong>. This is so butt-f**king easy, pun intended. If you<strong> PLUG UP</strong> her Hole, she will Climax.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danno">Danno</a>] 22-7-2009(83): I just think its hilarious how many stories are getting reported for this character. Come on!! what else could it be! How better to remember it ? Prudes please get over yourselves. If someone has a good story, just because you are easily offended, doesn&#039;t mean someone else( the majority ) won&#039;t find it useful. planning to be missionaries in Japan with all your Kanji skillz ? If you find this offensive...hahahaha. You will get a shock when you see your first KONBINI magazine shelf.LMAO..i gotsreported.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penot">penot</a>] 11-11-2008(41): My girlfriend <strong>plugs up</strong> her <strong>ちつ</strong>(vagina 膣) <em>hole</em> to <em>climax</em>! This Kanji&#039;s on-yomi is pronounced &#039;<strong>ちつ</strong>&#039; (チツ) // zhi4 질 (jil) 절 (jeol).
