primit: "Thanksgiving(swieto dziekczynienia) I choose the word Thanksgiving as only one possible way of making this primitive more concrete. The sense, as its composite primitives make clear, is of a &quot;land fiesta,&quot; or a harvest feast. If you choose a word of your own, make sure it does not conflict with fiesta. [6]"
heisig: "On a fruit <b>plantation</b> it is the <i>trees</i> that one is particularly grateful for at the time of <i>Thanksgiving</i>. Imagine yourself inviting a few representative <i>trees</i> from the fields and orchards to join you around the table to give thanks."
