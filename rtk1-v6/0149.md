heisig: "This character can mean both to <b>cleanse</b> and to make dirty. We will choose the latter and imagine someone who is displeasingly <i>plump</i> going to a skinny spa whose medicinal <i>waters</i> promise to <b>cleanse</b> him of his unwanted corpulence. Picture him sitting in the spa as the pounds melt away, leaving a greasy scum on top of the <i>water</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 28-11-2008(71): I couldn&#039;t find any reference to this kanji as meaning<strong> cleanse</strong>. It seems to be most often used in the following compound 沙汰 （さた）to mean affair. The other meanings seem to be closer to &#039;select&#039; so maybe Heisig meant<strong> cleanse</strong> in the ethnic sense here.. I&#039;m going to use the keyword &quot;selection&quot;, as in natural selection. Story: natural selection first began in the water, and those that were too plump were selected out.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 5-8-2009(4): The very plump man selected the Japanese toilet seat which will<strong> cleanse</strong> him with water automatically since he&#039;s too fat to reach back and wipe... (consider herman&#039;s explanation and think of &quot;selection&quot;).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 27-10-2010(3): 手持ち無沙汰 , ご無沙汰 , 沙汰 , 淘汰 <a href="../v4/2316">cleanse</a> (#2316 汰) タ( 太 ) ... Parts:氵, 太 <a href="../v4/120">plump</a> (#120 太) ... Similar: 浄土 <a href="../v4/1155">clean</a> (#1155 浄), 沙汰 <a href="../v4/2316">cleanse</a> (#2316 汰) ... Story: The Pacific Ocean ( 太平洋 ) routinely sweeps <em>Water</em> over low lying islands <strong>Cleansing</strong> them of human traces. (it&#039;s a weird sort of 淘汰 (natural selection).).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 1-9-2009(3): If you listen to what people <strong>select</strong> at restaurants, it&#039;s seldom <em>water</em> for the <em>plump</em> man.

When the <em>plump</em> guy tried to<strong> cleanse</strong> himself at the public bath, it was a strange <strong>incident</strong> because he splashed all the <em>water</em> out.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/truando">truando</a>] 27-11-2010(2): I use <strong>incident</strong>: 沙汰 【さた】 (n,vs) (1) affair; state; incident; issue; matter; 内沙汰 【うちざた】 (n) secret government business. STORY: There was an embarassing <strong>incident</strong> at a state reception : a <em>plump</em> woman, an official guest from Fidji, fell into the <em>water</em> of the fountain in front of the government building because someone had forgotten to remove a bench on the red carpet.
