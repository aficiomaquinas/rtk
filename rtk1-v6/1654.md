1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie">mhheie</a>] 6-2-2008(147): &quot;Once in a<strong> blue</strong> <em>moon</em>&quot; refers to a rare event. But originally &quot;blue moon&quot; refers to a full moon, in other words a fully <em>grown-up</em> moon. Whether once a month is rare or not depends on what we&#039;re talking about, but that happens to be the origin of the expression.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 17-5-2007(34): They say that as the sun gets older, it grows up and becomes red. However, that&#039;s not the case for the <em>moon</em>, which turns<strong> blue</strong> as it <em>grows up</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 26-3-2008(22): Once in a<strong> Blue</strong> <em>moon</em> you can see <em>Peter Pan</em> flying high above it.
