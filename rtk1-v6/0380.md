primit: "fiesta(fiesta, swieto, swietowanie) The picture in this primitive is what we may call a &quot;tassled arrow.&quot; A decorative tassle is strung on the shaft of an arrow to indicate that it is no longer a weapon but a symbol of a fiesta. As before, the first stroke is extended when it serves as a semienclosure. o From its original meaning of a defined area or zone, a range has also come to meana grazing land where cowboys roam and do whatever it is they do with cows. When the herds have all been driven to market, there is a great homecoming fiesta like that pictured here. As soon as the cowboys come home, home on the range, the first thing they do is kiss the ground (the mouth on the floor), and then get on with the fiesta. [11]"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 10-10-2007(208): An astronaut lands back at the launch<strong> range</strong>, kisses the <em>earth</em> beneath him with his <em>mouth</em>, then heads off to a <em>fiesta</em> to celebrate a safe flight.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 23-7-2008(62): Instead of Heisig&#039;s &quot;Fiesta&quot; I use &quot;Spear&quot;. Why? A spear is just a DROP extra on an Arrow. 域 ,<strong> range</strong> actually means<strong> range</strong> as in limits/boundary/border sort of<strong> range</strong>(In a box it was the old meaning for Country 國 (581). Ok way too much etymology here, but back to story. With your SPEAR standing in a HOLE on the FLOOR with SOIL to its left9as you dug some out), you can see the<strong> RANGE</strong> of the spear in attacking a possible enemy (re Diablo and other RPGs, spear&#039;s have<strong> range</strong>).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jHerbin">jHerbin</a>] 8-4-2010(30): When the <em>land</em> was within <strong>range</strong>, the pirates <em>kissed the deck</em> and had a <em>fiesta</em>.
