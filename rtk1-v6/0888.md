1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tcjeff">tcjeff</a>] 11-6-2008(182): A<strong> holy</strong> man hears with his <em>ears</em> before he speaks with his <em>mouth</em>, which places him higher than a <em>king</em> in people&#039;s esteem.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus">mspertus</a>] 3-7-2007(175): The trick for me is to remember that the 耳 is to the left of the 口 . However, this is easy because a true<strong> holy</strong> man uses his <em>ear</em> to listen (i.e., to God or his supplicant) before he opens his <em>mouth</em> to speak, unlike a charlatan who just makes something up. Of course, <em>king</em>s are often true<strong> holy</strong> men and prophets (e.g., King David in the bible).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lb4269">lb4269</a>] 19-3-2006(57): <strong>Holy</strong> Hand Grenade: Monty Python: Quest for the<strong> Holy</strong> Grail. The rabbit just tore the ear off of a knight with it&#039;s fierce mouth. The knight is running back, screaming, and the King is watching. He decides to call out for the<strong> Holy</strong> Hand Grenade to fix the situation.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 17-7-2006(49): Since God will only speak to the people through the king (or so he says, anyway), his ears and mouth are therefore<strong> holy</strong>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimsublimeman">jimsublimeman</a>] 22-6-2007(22): <strong>Holy</strong> men always seem to have their <em>mouths</em> in the <em>ears</em> of <em>kings</em> and other important leaders. Think Rasputin...

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/swiftman">swiftman</a>] 26-7-2009(14): <strong>Holy</strong> shit ... the <em>ears</em> and <em>mouth</em> of the <em>king</em> are all that is left after the battle.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 24-7-2006(12): Tyson bit<strong> Holy</strong>field&#039;s <em>ear</em> (with his <em>mouth</em> obviously). Shame really coz he used to be the <em>king</em> of the ring.

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/plumage">plumage</a>] 7-3-2009(10): &quot;HOLY,<strong> HOLY</strong>,<strong> HOLY</strong>,&quot; will be heard by all EARS, coming from all MOUTHS, proclaiming Christ the KING.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zanzibar">zanzibar</a>] 6-6-2009(8): &quot;To my EARs, straight from God&#039;s MOUTH.&quot;: that old, accepted concept of the divine (holy) right of KINGS.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep">krungthep</a>] 19-12-2009(4): <strong>Holy</strong> men are believed to have their <em>ears</em> close to the <em>mouth</em> of the gods and so they are above even <em>kings</em>.
