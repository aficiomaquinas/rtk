primit: "crown This pictograph of a simple crown is distinguished from the roof only by the absence of the chimney (the first drop at the top). It can be used for all the principal connotations of the word crown. We will meet the full character from which this element is derived later on, in FRAME 304 冠. [2]"
heisig: "Picture a <i>weather vane</i> beneath a regal <i>crown</i>, spinning round and round. It is not only <b>superfluous</b> but makes a perfect ass out of the one who wears it."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 14-1-2006(418): The king&#039;s crown was blown off by the wind. &quot;Oh well,&quot; he said, &quot;it&#039;s just a<strong> superfluous</strong> symbol.&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/emanalo">emanalo</a>] 6-7-2008(51): The court jester wears a <em>crown</em> and is full of <em>wind</em> with bad jokes. He is<strong> superfluous</strong> to the King&#039;s court. This kanji is read as &quot;JOU&quot; and commonly used to create the compound for <em>jou-dan</em> 冗談 (jest or joke) hence court jester. Also <em>jou-go</em> 冗語 (redundancy) and <em>jou-in</em> 冗員 (useless workers) 員 -<a href="../v4/56.html">employee</a> (#56 員).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tanaquil">tanaquil</a>] 23-4-2007(28): Trying to put a <em>crown</em> on the <em>wind</em> is like gilding the lily: entirely<strong> superfluous</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 12-2-2008(17): The <em>wind</em> bags who wear the <em>crown</em> are almost always<strong> SUPERFLUOUS</strong> to the governance of their countries.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TadghD">TadghD</a>] 30-6-2009(10): Instead of just fluous, like the flow of the wind, I crown you<strong> superfluous</strong>.
