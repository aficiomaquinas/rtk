heisig: "Picture a <i>weather vane</i> beneath a regal <i>crown</i>, spinning round and round. It is not only <b>superfluous</b> but makes a perfect ass out of the one who wears it."
primit: "crown This pictograph of a simple crown is distinguished from the roof only by the absence of the chimney (the first drop at the top). It can be used for all the principal connotations of the word crown. We will meet the full character from which this element is derived later on, in FRAME 304 冠. [2]"
