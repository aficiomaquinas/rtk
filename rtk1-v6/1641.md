8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 9-2-2011(1): The<strong> remains</strong> of that cute little guy for Ice Age is just a <em>skeleton</em>. But we know it&#039;s his <em>skeleton</em>, because it is still clutching onto an <em>acorn</em>. Although he is gone, his spirit still<strong> remains</strong>.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 15-8-2008(1): People always wonder why those <em>skeleton</em> enemies in Mario always come back after you jump on them. The truth is that every time they get crushed, they drop their core <em>acorn</em>, which contains all of their data and such. If this <em>acorn</em> is left there with their<strong> remains</strong> for more than a few seconds, it will come back to life. So if you want to make sure that those<strong> remains</strong> remain<strong> remains</strong>, you&#039;d better stoop down and throw away that acorn after you jump on a <em>skeleton</em>, Mario!
