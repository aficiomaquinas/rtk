heisig: "This kanji calls to mind the famous myth of the &quot;golden bough.&quot; As you may recall, what made the sacred <b>oak</b> in the forest of Diana the Huntress outside of Rome &quot;golden&quot; were the <i>white</i> berries of the mistletoe that grew in the branches of the tree. When the light of the sun shone through them, they turned yellow and the branch to which they clung appeared to be made of gold. (If you don't know the story, take a break today and hunt it down in a dictionary of myth and fable. Even if you forget the kanji - which of course you won't - the story of the mistletoe and the fate it brought to Balder the Beautiful is most memorable.)"
