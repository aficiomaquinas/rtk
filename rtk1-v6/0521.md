primit: "kazoo(toy instrument making sound) This primitive’s special usefulness lies not in its frequency but in its simplification of a few otherwise difficult kanjis. It piclesson tures the sound of a fiesta, namely a kazoo. Note how the element for sound is written first, the fifth stroke extended so that it can be used in the element for fiesta. [12]"
heisig: "A person of <b>discriminating</b> intellect can tell the difference between mere <i>kazoo</i>-buzzing and <i>words</i> spoken wisely."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amthomas">amthomas</a>] 15-3-2007(261): <em>Words</em> are difficult to discriminate/discern from <em>sounds</em> in the middle of a <em>fiesta</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 14-2-2008(72): I have<strong> discriminating</strong> taste. I&#039;d rather listen to the <em>words</em> of a lecture than attend a <em>kazoo</em> concert. (Picture some snobby guy in a tweed jacket turning up his nose at entering a loud raucous kazoo recital).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 28-1-2007(59): I wonder why Heisig didn&#039;t use <strong>discernment</strong> for this kanji. It fits the meaning equally and it is not as loaded as <strong>discrimination</strong>. // It is quite hard to <strong>discern</strong> <em>words</em> in the middle of a <em>noisy fiesta</em>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 10-5-2009(14): <strong>Discriminating</strong> someone&#039;s <em>words</em> from other sounds is hard to do in the middle of a <em>noisy fiesta</em>. (Thanks esaulgd).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 31-8-2007(12): Socrates has apparently joined the KKK, and is actively<strong> discriminating</strong> against Black people. But to add a bit of artistic flair, as the ancient Greeks were wont to do, he says his racist words through a kazoo. <em>Socrates</em> humming the n-<em>word</em> through a <em>kazoo</em> - who would have thought?
