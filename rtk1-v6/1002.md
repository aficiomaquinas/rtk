1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(80): Before <a href="../v4/932">lacquer</a> (#932 漆) was made with water, it was made by draining this <em>body part</em> of fluid: the<strong> knee</strong>!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 2-8-2008(44): Back in ancient Japan, people didn&#039;t have<strong> knee</strong> pads for things like rollerblading and such (what, come on. Ninjas on rollerblades. Ultimate 90s flashback). Instead, they would simply dip their <strong>knee</strong>s in <em>laquer</em>, and wait until it dried (hence the <em>flesh</em>, and the abscence of any <em>drops of water</em>). Unfortunately, this meant that you would have to wait about 30 minutes after deciding to go rollerblade until you could actually do it (took some time to dry) - and removing it was a serious pain.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Corodon">Corodon</a>] 11-8-2009(31): The <strong>knee</strong>s are the <em>part of the body</em> that I protect with <em>lacquer</em>ed<strong> knee</strong>pads.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yozora">Yozora</a>] 7-6-2010(12): Don&#039;t<strong> knee</strong>l on the wet lacquer. When it dries your flesh will be stuck to it!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mecreant">mecreant</a>] 7-8-2012(4): I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took and arrow in the<strong> knee</strong>. Now I have to wear a lacquered<strong> knee</strong> brace to protect my wounded flesh.
