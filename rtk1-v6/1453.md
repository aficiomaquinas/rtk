1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 19-5-2008(276): This Kanji is the same ones used in the Japanese Language proficiency tests; i.e. ikkyuu ( 一級 ) The Kanji doesnt describe<strong> class</strong> as in a &quot;class of students&quot; or &quot;classroom,&quot; but rather a grade of quality or ability. ---------- Spiderman is taking the JLPT Level 1. In desperation he REACHES OUT to grab his friend&#039;s answer sheet next to him, who seems to be doing well. The other test takers are obviously a<strong> class</strong> above him. Looks like this test is above his<strong> class</strong> of knowledge.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jamiemw">jamiemw</a>] 17-9-2007(65): Spiderman with his arm stretched out showing the<strong> class</strong> how he produces webs.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 23-9-2008(59): <em>Spider-Man reaches out</em> to every<strong> class</strong>, rich and poor.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akira">akira</a>] 25-12-2007(22): Spiderman stretching his arms at different length produces a different<strong> class</strong> of web.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 14-1-2009(20): <strong>Class, grade, rank.</strong> Members of a particular<strong> class</strong> or rank are connected (as if by a <em>thread</em>) by their similarities and common circumstances; and often, by the extent to which they will <em>reach out and exert</em> themselves to new heights. 下級 (low grade). 学級 (school<strong> class</strong>). 勤労階級 (working<strong> class</strong>). 最高級 (top<strong> class</strong>). 審級 (instance). 上級 (advanced level, senior). 中級 (intermediate level). 飛び級 (skipping a grade). 上の級に進む (to move up to a higher grade).
