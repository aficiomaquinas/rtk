1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 17-4-2007(130): <em>Captain Hook</em>, his <strong>spirit</strong> crushed, is lying on the ground cursing <em>Wolverine</em> who has defeated him with his far superior claws.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Balaam">Balaam</a>] 2-2-2008(57): You&#039;re reclining on the floor trying to hook a sheaf with a small hook through the cracks. That you&#039;ve been doing this for seven hours without success shows your burning<strong> spirit</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 11-7-2009(34): <em>Wolverine</em> has a fighting<strong> spirit</strong>, and even while <em>reclining</em> on the <em>floor</em> sharpens the <em>hooks</em> on his claws.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 30-5-2006(27): Hint : the first four strokes may be seen as <em>Captain Hook</em> : <em>reclining on the floor</em>, shaking his <em>hook</em> in the air and moaning &quot;Peter Pan! Why did you elude me again! Whyyy!&quot;. Se here we have Captain Hook having one of his fits, and about the only thing that will bring him his<strong> spirit</strong> back is a <em>sheaf</em>. The last part probably won&#039;t make sense but I am French speaking and somehow I settled onto the image of a &quot;bouquet&quot; of flowers for the word &quot;sheaf&quot;.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 22-5-2009(18): Someone is <em>lying</em> on the <em>floor</em>, a huge <em>x</em> ripped into their stomach with a <em>fishhook</em>. A passer by says &quot;Gen<strong>ki</strong> desu ka&quot;.
