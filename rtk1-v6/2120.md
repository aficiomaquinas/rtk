heisig: "Learning this character will take a little doing. Before we start, it is a good idea to keep the key word distinct from <i>melancholy</i> (Frame 663), with which it combines to create the psychological condition of depression (a metaphor based on the hollow or sinking of the material <i>depression</i> we met in Frame 1421).
The picture of <b>gloom</b> begins with a small <i>grove</i> of trees, under which we see a <i>crown</i> made out of used <i>tin cans</i>. Next (the lower half of the kanji) we find a combination that appears only a few times in modern characters and only once in those treated in the volumes of <i>Remembering the Kanji</i>. It is composed of a <i>shovel</i> with a <i>sheaf</i> dotted with small <i>drops</i> on all sides. Think of it as a large scoop <i>shovel</i> attached to the front of a bulldozer, whose driver is singing: ♪ &quot;Bulldozing in the <i>sheaves</i>, bulldozing in the <i>sheaves</i>...&quot; ♪ The <i>drops</i> represent the chaff flying about as the <i>sheaves</i> are tossed about by the heavy machinery.
There is <i>someone sitting on the ground</i> alongside, watching as the machinery makes its way around the neighboring farmland - and it's you, wearing your <i>tin-can crown</i>. You feel overwhelmed by the impending doom as the invasion of agro-business draws closer and closer to the <i>grove</i>, the only patch of woods that remains of what once was a vast forest. The whole scene represents a re-<i>shaping</i> of the natural environment that brings the heavy weight of <b>gloom</b> down upon you.
A bit much, perhaps, but there are enough elements to allow for any number of other combinations."

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch">NeoGlitch</a>] 1-3-2012(49): In the middle of the GROVE you find a TIN CAN. There&#039;s a CROWN inside! You are very excited with your finding, but then a figure appears behind you: &quot;Hey, gimme that kid!&quot; You turn back and it&#039;s WOLVERINE, with a SHOVEL on his back and all COVERED IN <a href="../v4/2866.html">rocksalt</a> (#2866 鹵) &quot;I found that crown in the rocksalt mines over there, so hand it over!&quot; Unless you wanna die, you hand him the crown and he goes away. Then you SIT ON THE FLOOR, feeling impotent, and the SHAPE of your face becomes all <strong>GLOOMY ☹ (The 終 !)</strong>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 2-6-2011(22): A popular mnemonic device for this character is: リンカーンはアメリカンコーヒーを３杯飲んだ . Here&#039;s how it works: <a href="http://google.com/#q=リンカーンは⇒林＋缶＋ワ">リンカーンは⇒林＋缶＋ワ</a> <a href="http://google.com/#q=アメリカンコーヒーを⇒米＋コ＋ヒ">アメリカンコーヒーを⇒米＋コ＋ヒ</a> <a href="http://google.com/#q=３杯飲んだ⇒ノ＋ノ＋ノ">３杯飲んだ⇒ノ＋ノ＋ノ</a> .

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 3-11-2009(16): Note: 鬱 and 欝 <a href="../v4/2856.html">depressed</a> (#2856 欝) are variants. In such cases it may be easier to use the same keyword, calling the other kanji &quot;keyword (alt)&quot;. 鬱 is the more common of the two and is in the new Joyo kanji list.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 14-11-2009(8): <strong>Sulky</strong>: let the bottom left 鬯 (rock salt + spoon) = salt shaker: The kid in the restaurant is <strong>sulky</strong> when the <em>salt shaker</em> and <em>can</em> of coke spills all over his cardboard (<em>wooden</em>) birthday crown, creating a massively <em>shaped</em> sticky puddle all over the floor.
