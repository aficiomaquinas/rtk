1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 9-8-2007(170): <strong>Mr.</strong> President! We all stand here <em>together</em> under a national <em>flag</em>. One thing is certain: we&#039;ll never give in. We are launching nuclear <em>missiles</em> now to implement mutually assured destruction protocol.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django">Django</a>] 2-10-2007(83): (+synewave) Noah looks on in disbelief as<strong> Mr.</strong> and Mrs. Smith board the <em>Ark</em>, start waving their <em>flag</em> everywhere and blasting everything in sight with a <em>missile launcher</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 30-11-2009(37): <strong>Mr.</strong> Bush is has sullied the reputation of the US <em>flag</em>, this tragedy <em>together</em> with the countless <em>missiles</em> that have killed innocent people have sent the worlds opinion of America the lowest it has ever been.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 4-12-2007(32): Only in Hollywood. The new NOAH&#039;s ARK movie had the FLAG raised over the ARK signifying it&#039;s about to leave. Crowds come to board but Noah aims MISSILES at them to hold them away. His catch phrase &quot;They Call me MISTER Noah!!!&quot; Well, better than Evan Almighty I guess.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fergal">fergal</a>] 29-9-2009(26): This is the <strong>Mr.</strong> (との) used when addressing someone at the start of a letter. How letters were delivered to the <em>ark</em> was intersting. Noah would wave a big <em>flag</em> and the post man would fire a <em>flag</em>-seeking <em>missile</em> full of letters for <strong>Mr</strong> Rhino and <strong>Mr</strong> Giraffe etc.
