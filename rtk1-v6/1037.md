1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 4-2-2007(143): <em>Mr. T</em> says, &quot;I ain&#039;t afraid o&#039; no foo! I&#039;ll give anyone an <em>elbow</em> to the face, I don&#039;t care if it&#039;s <em>Buddha</em> himself!&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 11-4-2007(77): <strong>Buddha</strong> is a <em>person</em> who always seems to have his <em>elbows</em> bent.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 25-5-2009(30): Out of respect for<strong> Buddha</strong>, <em>Chuck Norris</em> simply <em>elbows</em> him rather than roundhouse-kicking him in the face. However, the sheer force of <em>Chuck Norris&#039;s elbow</em> is still powerful enough to bring<strong> Buddha</strong> to enlightenment in one blow.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pm215">pm215</a>] 21-4-2008(17): &quot;If you see the<strong> Buddha</strong>, kill him&quot; goes the koan. <em>Mr T</em> wouldn&#039;t go that far, but he&#039;d certainly be prepared to <em>elbow</em> the guy in the ribs...

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 13-11-2007(15): In Japan, <em>Dracula</em> fears images of<strong> Buddha</strong> rather than the cross, so here you see him with his crooked <em>elbow</em> raised in the classic movie pose, holding his cape up to cover his face, as someone confronts him with a tiny<strong> Buddha</strong> statue.
