1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei">javiergakusei</a>] 27-3-2007(245): Don’t confuse it with “take along” (287). In that one, there was a car so you could take along your friends once you found them on the road. In this one, there is an army chariot just to<strong> carry</strong> military supplies (sorry no room for you).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu">ruisu</a>] 3-10-2007(66): Roads<strong> carry</strong> armies (in contrast to seas<strong> carry</strong>ing navies or skies<strong> carry</strong>ing air forces).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kinkypete">kinkypete</a>] 13-1-2008(40): &quot;swing low, sweet <em>chariot</em>, coming for to<strong> carry</strong> me hoooommmee.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401">eri401</a>] 27-2-2009(16): The difference between <a href="../v4/289">transport</a> (#289 輸), <a href="../v4/287">take along</a> (#287 連) and <a href="../v4/303">carry</a> (#303 運)? Transport 輸 = when your car moves big items, like meat and sabers for that one butcher&#039;s hut. Take Along 連 = when you take a guest in your car on the road.<strong> Carry</strong> 運 = the luck you<strong> carry</strong> when the king&#039;s carriage is out on the road, tossing gold coins to bystanders.
