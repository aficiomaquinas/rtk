heisig: "There are actually a number of kanji for the word <b>I</b>, but the others tend to be more specific than this one. The key word here should be taken in the general psychological sense of the &quot;perceiving subject.&quot; Now the one place in our bodies that all <i>five</i> senses are concentrated in is the head, which has no less than <i>five mouths</i>: 2 nostrils, 2 ears, and 1 mouth. Hence, <i>five mouths</i> = <b>I</b>."
