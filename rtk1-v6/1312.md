1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 21-9-2006(226): [tender; weakness; gentleness; softness] Love me <strong>tender</strong>, Love me perfect, Never cheat on me. Or I&#039;ll impale you on my <em>Halberd</em>, And hang ya atop a <em>tree</em>...

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 1-6-2007(72): Use a <em>halberd</em> to<strong> tender</strong>ize a <em>tree</em>: <em>halberds</em> can chop, poke, and slash, so it&#039;s all good!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101">Viking101</a>] 4-1-2010(55): I like my steak<strong> tender</strong>. That&#039;s why I impale it with a <em>halberd</em> and smash it against a tree to<strong> tender</strong>ize it.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 6-2-2008(32): The poor warrior wanted to eat a<strong> tender</strong> steak but all he could find was a slab of <em>wood</em>. He chops at and beats at the <em>wood</em> with his <em>halberd</em> until it becomes<strong> tender</strong> so that he can imagine eating a<strong> tender</strong> steak. Primitive placement: remember the halberd is on top pounding down on the wood below. Careful: <a href="../v4/993">tenderness</a> (#993 優).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 30-3-2009(19): Seeing all the children he orphaned, the now<strong> tender</strong> knight hung his <em>halberd</em> up on a <em>tree</em>, permanently.

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha">misha</a>] 3-1-2008(17): It&#039;s too easy to confuse the keyword with <a href="../v4/993">tenderness</a> (#993 優). I remember this kanji by associating it with Ryoko Tani, the famous judo ( 柔道 ) player. Her nickname is <strong>Yawara</strong>-chan ( 柔らちゃん ). Imagine her singing Elvis&#039; &quot;Love me<strong> tender</strong>, love me true&quot; to avoid confusing the keyword with <a href="../v4/993">tenderness</a> (#993 優).

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elanlan">elanlan</a>] 7-10-2009(13): This kanji refers to<strong> tender</strong> meat, not<strong> tender</strong> in disposition. Thus, it resembles oldschool meat<strong> tender</strong>izers, which were nothing more than <em>halberds</em> on <em>wooden</em> sticks that you beat your meat with to make it<strong> tender</strong>. (no pun intended).

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 14-10-2007(10): Elvis is standing on top of a <em>tree</em> singing “Love me<strong> tender</strong> . . . etc”. Local people are poking him with <em>halberds</em>, trying to get him to shut up and come down, “You’ll be<strong> tender</strong> by the time we’ve finished with you . . .”.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 17-4-2010(6): Use a <em>wooden halberd</em> to<strong> tender</strong>ize your steak.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penot">penot</a>] 29-11-2008(5): Maoマオ Zedong came to the <strong>JUU</strong>dou( 柔道 ) Tornament, with a <em><strong>full-blown halberd</strong></em> (both <em><strong>halberd</strong> head &amp; <strong>wooden</strong>-staff</em>) ; He was disqualified &amp; was told that, &quot;Judo is a<strong> tender</strong> sport... people here hug each other &amp; swing each other around gently. Please... be.. 柔らかい (<strong>yawa</strong>rakai = soft &amp; gentle).&quot;//All 矛 -containing kanji, like scared cows, make a &#039;short&#039; &amp; feeble &#039;ム&#039; sound under the leadership Mao Zedong, but &#039; 柔 &#039; knows <strong>JUU</strong>dou &amp; isn&#039;t scared to make a longer&amp;different pronounciation.
