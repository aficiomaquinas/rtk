1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 7-6-2007(157): I have a <em>funnel</em> attached to my laptop that takes my prof&#039;s<strong> lecture</strong> and puts the <em>words</em> into a text file. The bigger the funnel, the more accurate the conversion, so picture a bunch of laptops with large, unwieldy funnels attached to the USB port.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 12-3-2007(101): Image: a professor walking around with a <em>funnel</em> and simply pouring his <em>words</em> into each students head instead of a <strong>lecture</strong>. (Primitive: <em>FUNNEL</em>, who got the <em>celery</em> stuck in the funnel <em>again</em>?! You know it&#039;s not supposed to be used for that!).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tenricefieldsglue">tenricefieldsglue</a>] 7-7-2009(63): FUNNEL primitive: &quot;<em>Celery--again</em>?!&quot; &quot;You&#039;ll eat your <em>celery</em> or else I&#039;ll make you eat it with a FUNNEL!&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99">dshill99</a>] 14-5-2010(39): At a<strong> lecture</strong> <em>words</em> are <em>funneled</em> into students.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 15-7-2007(15): <em>Socrates</em> is giving a<strong> lecture</strong>. He&#039;s using a <em>funnel</em> as a megaphone but also pours some celery in there between words. // Primitive: <em>funnel</em> = who got the <em>celery</em> stuck in the funnel <em>again</em>?!
