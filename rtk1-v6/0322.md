heisig: "The key word in this frame refers to the underworld, the world of the dead. By way of the classic Greek association, it is also used for the &quot;dwarf planet&quot; Pluto. Since no one knows precisely when this part of the cosmos was finished, we may imagine it as the <i>crowning</i> deed of <i>day six</i> of the creation."
