heisig: "<i>Bound up</i> . . . <i>glass canopy</i> . . . <i>walking stick</i> . . . <i>two</i>. If you write the character once, you will see why we avoided using the element for <i>soil</i>, which would prompt you to write it in improper order."
commen: "* As a primitive, imagine the tool used by draftsmen and carpenters to draw right-<i>angles</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 4-5-2007(203): A museum display of two walking sticks bound together under a glass canopy, showing the first device used to measure an<strong> angle</strong>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-12-2007(36): [+nuke] As a primitive, a boomerang. This boomerang is used to grab a bunch of meat, or <em>flesh</em>, lying around on the ground at a farm. First, you throw it straight at a <em>walking stick</em>, then it makes a right<strong> angle</strong> and goes to <em>walking stick</em> number <em>two</em>, and wraps around that. A quick tug, and you&#039;ve got all the <em>flesh</em> flying toward you contained in that tri<strong>angle</strong>. Hooray for free (stolen) food!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 30-6-2007(27): [angle; corner; square; horn; antlers] I needed to measure an <strong>angle</strong>, so I improvised a rudimentary protractor by <em>bounding up</em> a <em>walking stick</em> to some <em>body part</em> of mine.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 8-12-2007(16): The<strong> ANGLE</strong> of a Boomerang? BOUND UP, thrown by the BODY, but is not a WALKING STICK thanks to that 90 degree<strong> ANGLE</strong> in each one. So as a primitive, use Boomerang.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ezmoreldo">ezmoreldo</a>] 30-6-2008(8): If you bind up a circle with a rope, tied tightly it will have<strong> angle</strong>s.
