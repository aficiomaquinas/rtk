He stands outside his car bowing over and over saying <a href="http://google.com/#q=ご免なさい、ご免なさい、ご免なさい。">ご免なさい、ご免なさい、ご免なさい。</a> | Note: I&#039;ve actually witnessed this very event happening here in Japan. It is a common thing that people here will do when &quot;caught&quot; by the police...you&#039;ll see them sometimes bowing furiously apologizing over and over for their &quot;bad&quot; behavior.

It ended in a drama: It was hit by a car. When the driver realized it, he got out of the car and <em>excused</em> himself: &quot;I am so so sorry! Are you okay?&quot; (careful: <a href="../v4/2416">elude</a> (#2416 遁). You should probably use <strong>deviate</strong>).
