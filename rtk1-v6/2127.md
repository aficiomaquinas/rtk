1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 8-1-2006(114): Tip : as a primitive <em>rabbit</em> becomes Bugs Bunny of Looney Tunes fame. Here <em>Bugs Bunny</em><strong> elude</strong>s Elmer Fudd the hunter, once again.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 5-2-2008(100): <em>Bugs Bunny</em><strong> elude</strong>s Elmer Fudd by pretending to be <em>road</em>kill.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 20-7-2007(55): Word play to differentiate<strong> elude</strong>/evade:<strong> elude</strong> ~= e-lewd. Alice is following Mr. <em>Rabbit</em> on the <em>road</em>. Mr. Rabbit flashes her in a lewd way and disappears, completely <strong>eluding</strong> her.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 20-2-2007(36): I like to maintain the primitive as <strong>excuse</strong>. Here a speedster is caught trying to<strong> elude</strong> the police. He stands outside his car bowing over and over saying <a href="http://google.com/#q=ご免なさい、ご免なさい、ご免なさい。">ご免なさい、ご免なさい、ご免なさい。</a> | Note: I&#039;ve actually witnessed this very event happening here in Japan. It is a common thing that people here will do when &quot;caught&quot; by the police...you&#039;ll see them sometimes bowing furiously apologizing over and over for their &quot;bad&quot; behavior.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/b0ng0">b0ng0</a>] 17-2-2009(15): A <em>rabbit</em> on the <em>road</em> has a hard time <strong>eluding</strong> cars.
