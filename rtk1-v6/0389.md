primit: "march(marsz, w marszu) As distinct from the parade, the march points to a formal demonstration, whose emotions are generally a far cry from the happy spirit of the parade. The inclusion of the one gives the sense of the singlemindedness and unity of the group joined in the march. As was the case with parade, the primitive inside the enclosure indicates who or what is marching. [6]"
heisig: "Here we see a <i>march</i> of <i>women</i> demonstrating on behalf of equal rights, something extremely <b>intimidating</b> to the male chauvinist population."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bigloui">bigloui</a>] 2-2-2006(164): The <em>march</em> of <em>women</em> - against <em>intimidation</em> in the workplace - is pretty <em>intimidating</em> in itself!

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 10-12-2007(64): Interesting that this kanji also has the meanings of &quot;dignity&quot; and &quot;threaten.&quot; I can see how a <em>march</em> of <em>women</em> in Japan would be seen as <em>intimidating</em> by most men.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nekesu04">Nekesu04</a>] 12-11-2008(52): A <em>one woman</em> <em>parade</em>? How is that supposed to<strong> intimidate</strong> me?

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephan">stephan</a>] 3-10-2008(27): I use <em>Grim Reaper</em> instead of <em>march</em> for the primitive, because he&#039;s the <em>one</em> holding the <em>scythe</em> (see [360]). Now imagine a female Grim Reaper - that&#039;s even more <strong>intimidating</strong>!

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaeru">kaeru</a>] 31-10-2008(25): A group of feminist WOMEN are MARCHING for their rights, theyre so ugly it&#039;s INTIMIDATING.
