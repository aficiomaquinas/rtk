1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 3-12-2008(42): I was having <em>mutual difficulties</em> in my relationship. She was always the one wearing the <em>crown</em> and I was the one picking the <em>fruit</em>. In order to fix the problem I checked the<strong> glossary</strong> for &quot;<em>mutual difficulties</em>&quot; but found nothing. I guess we&#039;re going to have to <em>mutually end</em> our relationship.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 12-3-2010(27): When I went to <em>Headless Mutual</em>, the bank for tough London gangsters, I was given a pamphlet that said &quot;If you try&#039;a rip us off, we&#039;ll give you the rough end of a pineapple.&quot; I didn&#039;t quite understand this phrase, but it was important that I knew my legal obligations, so I consulted my <strong>Glossary</strong> of British Thieves&#039; Argot. The result: &quot;&#039;give one the rough end of a pineapple&#039;: lit. insert the <em>crown</em> of the <em>fruit</em> into the recipient&#039;s anus. Metaphorically used to mean &#039;to exact vengeance&#039;. Oh, I see now.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brose">brose</a>] 2-4-2007(22): People who read the<strong> glossary</strong> are <em>mutually exclusive</em> (exclude the top line of <a href="../v4/757">mutually</a> (#757 互) ) from those who eat <em>crowned fruit</em> イ はりねずみ same kind 語彙 .

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 26-1-2009(9): I was reading a recipe book but had trouble figuring out what a &quot;pineapple&quot; was. Thanks to the <em>one-way assisting</em><strong> glossary</strong> at the end, I learnt that a pineapple was a <em>crowned fruit</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BladeWalker">BladeWalker</a>] 27-7-2012(8): We had no idea what a <em>crowned fruit</em> was so we <em>mutually</em> checked the<strong> glossary</strong>. Well, I say mutually, but really I did all the work.
