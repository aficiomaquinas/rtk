heisig: "This kanji show a unique <b>system</b> for leading <i>cows</i> to the slaughterer's <i>saber</i>: one ties a <i>belt</i> about their waist and fixes that <i>belt</i> to an overhead cable, pulling the <i>cow</i> up into the air where it hangs suspended, helpless against the fate that awaits it."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kelly">Kelly</a>] 25-6-2007(168): The<strong> system</strong> for making leather <em>belts</em> involves slicing up a <em>cow</em> with a <em>sword</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 7-2-2009(61): Why all the gore and violence? How about a samurai cow? He doesn&#039;t have to be a violent samurai, either. He only wears the sword because he&#039;s part of the <em>bushi</em><strong> SYSTEM</strong>. Actually, he studies ikebana, shodo, and zen. Imagine him sitting cross-legged in a Zen temple (a very <em>Special</em> Zen temple). The master asks him if a dog has buddha nature and, shifting the swords in his belt, he calmly replies, &quot;Moo!&quot;.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/potempkin">potempkin</a>] 11-9-2008(45): Gary Larson cartoon of the feudal Japanese <strong>system</strong>: <em>cows</em> walking around with <em>belts</em>, complete with katana <em>sabers</em>. The Sa-MOO-rai class <strong>system</strong>.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tenricefieldsglue">tenricefieldsglue</a>] 21-5-2009(32): Jurassic Park has a<strong> system</strong> for feeding velociraptors. First a <em>cow</em> gets <em>belt</em>ed. Second the cow is lowered down into the raptors&#039; cage. Third the raptor ruptures the cow with his <em>saber</em> like talons.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fredde79">fredde79</a>] 4-9-2007(26): I used Heisig story here but i tweaked it a little. It works better for me if i imagine the belt is around the tail of the cow, cause that it what it looks like in the kanji.
