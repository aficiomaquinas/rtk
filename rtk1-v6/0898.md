heisig: "The key word for this kanji connotes the &quot;muddying&quot; effect on a soft consonant brought about by vibrating the vocal chords. For example, in English a &quot;j&quot; is <b>voiced</b> while a &quot;sh&quot; is unvoiced. In Japanese, the し is changed to じ when it is <b>voiced</b>. The primitives are: <i>water</i> . . . <i>eye</i> . . . <i>bound up</i> . . . <i>insect</i>."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan">Istvan</a>] 28-6-2007(228): The fly is wrapped in a spiderweb voicing &quot;Help me, Help Me&quot; under the watchful eye of the spider who&#039;s venom is dripping like water from her fangs.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rhclaghorn">rhclaghorn</a>] 29-12-2007(153): Pour <em>water</em> over the <em>eyes</em> of a <em>bound up</em> <em>insect</em> if you want to hear a pitiful buzz that is very similar to a<strong> VOICED</strong> consanant.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 6-9-2007(52): This is how to produce<strong> voiced</strong> consonants, like Z: [1] use lots of saliva (<em>water</em>); [2] you can <em>see</em> the vibrating of the vocal chords in a mirror; [3] the sound is that of a zzzzooming <em>insect</em>, as if <em> bound up</em> in your throat.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 17-6-2006(41): <strong>Voiced</strong> here refers to the &quot;muddying&quot; effect on a soft consonant brought about by vibrating the vocal chords. For the image of muddy, we have an <em>insect</em> that is <em>bound up</em> and lowered into the <em>water</em> as bait. As it struggles for its life, it stirs up the sediment at the bottom, muddying the <em>water</em> such that your <em>eyes</em> cannot see through it.
