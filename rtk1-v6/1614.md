1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/happychair">happychair</a>] 14-3-2006(235): The<strong> CATALPA</strong> is the tree that bears the SPICY Indian bean (NOTE - The<strong> Catalpa</strong> is also known as the &quot;Indian Bean&quot; due to the bean pods that grow from it).

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep">johnzep</a>] 7-8-2007(43): The <strong>caterpillar&#039;s</strong> favorite <em>tree</em> is the <strong>catalpa</strong> because it tastes <em>spicy</em>.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tryllid">tryllid</a>] 6-10-2008(22): Tree + Spicy; The<strong> catalpa</strong> <em>tree</em> has seed pods that look like <em>spicy</em> peppers.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 21-3-2008(17): I know the <strong>Catalpa</strong> as the &quot;promise tree&quot;. A young person will cite the person he or she loves under a <strong>Catalpa</strong> <em>tree</em> to declare his or her feelings. The fact that the right primitive means both <em>spicy</em> and <em>bitter</em> illustrates the hesitance and stress that precedes the ultimate reply.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 1-6-2012(11): This kanji is barely used. Just rename the keyword to PEPPER TREE (so you don&#039;t need a story) and move on. If you do a google image search for the kanji 梓 , you&#039;ll find that this character almost exclusively refers to the female name あずさ (by the way, you will see some cute girls).
