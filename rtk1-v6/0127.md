heisig: "The picture in this kanji is not a pleasant one. It shows a large and fluffy <i>St. Bernard dog</i> stretched out on a table all stuffed and stewed and garnished with vegetables, its paws in the air and an apple in its mouth. At each corner of the table sits an eager but empty <i>mouth</i>, waiting for the <b>utensils</b> to arrive so the feast can begin."

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps">ceeeps</a>] 2-9-2007(184): Imagine four hungry <em>mouths</em> all sitting around the table. They are all banging their <strong>utensils</strong> on the table waiting for a <em>big</em> meal to be placed in the centre.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo">NooNoo</a>] 16-4-2008(53): Note: 器 by itself means <strong>container/caliber/vessel</strong>. And 食器 means eating<strong> utensil</strong>s (&quot;food container&quot;, hehe).

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe">stereovibe</a>] 26-2-2008(39): Four <em>mouths</em> sit at the four corners of the table, waiting for their<strong> utensil</strong>s, ready to devour the large, spread eagled St. Bernard stretched out on the table!

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lee101">lee101</a>] 28-7-2011(25): I swear RevTK has got too politically correct, I mean people on here are copying Heisig&#039;s original story only shortening it which is fine, yet they are getting dislikes, only due to the fact its about eating a dog!? Other instances include where people make slight reference to sex, race, violence - Heisig clearly states that it&#039;s fine to do this. (part 1, part two on the next frame).

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/squirrelscuba">squirrelscuba</a>] 14-5-2010(13): Four jgirl&#039;s mouths surrounding my large<strong> utensil</strong>.
