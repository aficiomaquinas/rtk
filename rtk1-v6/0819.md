1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/desmidus">desmidus</a>] 4-2-2008(413): The 69 position allows both parties to<strong> mutually</strong> give themselves pleasure.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 4-9-2007(37): If you can combined your <em>walls</em> with another house&#039;s <em>walls</em>, both houses would<strong> mutually</strong> benefit, by the increase in size....

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars">FoxintheStars</a>] 20-8-2010(16): <strong>Mutually</strong> means &quot;You and You together&quot;---two katakana ユ (yu)s interlocking top and bottom.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 4-12-2008(16): It feels better to imagine two elbows linked together in mutuality.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(10): Pictograph, see book. To me this kanji looks like the T and L of<strong> mutually</strong> (in the first two strokes) mirrored upside-down just like the King/Queen/Valet of a card game. The two L&#039;s of<strong> mutually</strong> are there to remind you the pair of TL&#039;s are<strong> mutually</strong> joined by the L&#039;s (i.e. “two times T and L, joined by the L&#039;s”).

6) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alliko">Alliko</a>] 10-3-2010(8): (ゴ, たが・い)　I help ユ and ユ help me, so we both benefit<strong> mutually</strong>. 互恵 【ごけい】 reciprocal; 互換性 【ごかんせい】 compatibility.

7) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/frony0">frony0</a>] 7-1-2012(5): You shouldn&#039;t need a mnemonic for this, it&#039;s the coolest kanji in the book!

8) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sdrobertm">sdrobertm</a>] 22-1-2011(5): 69 is<strong> mutually</strong> satisfying.

9) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brainrobert">brainrobert</a>] 9-6-2010(5): The 69 position is<strong> mutually</strong> satisfying. tagai na 互い with each other.

10) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/emichaelsen">emichaelsen</a>] 12-6-2012(3): Let&#039;s face it. You should just imagine a vicious 69 between <em>2 walls</em>. It&#039;s basically a pictograph.
