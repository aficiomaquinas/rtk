1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 29-12-2006(284): A<strong> grant</strong> is <em>easy money</em>.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 21-2-2007(57): Do you want free <em>shells</em> from the government? It&#039;s <em>easy</em> with my new book, &quot;How to Get a Free<strong> Grant</strong> from the Government!&quot; Call today!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 18-10-2005(28): This<strong> grant</strong> is <em>shells</em> (money) that were awarded to you, or that someone &quot;deigned to give&quot; to you (another kanji meaning). Regardless, they are &quot;<em>easy shells</em>&quot; because you won&#039;t have to return them, and you didn&#039;t have to work for them! -- &quot;grant is <em>easy shells</em>&quot;.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 10-6-2010(16): A<strong> grant</strong> may seem like easy money, but then the kanji would be out of order. So you must justify the<strong> grant</strong> <em>money</em> first, then it will be <em>easy</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature">crystalcastlecreature</a>] 17-12-2008(8): MONEY that&#039;s EASY is a<strong> GRANT</strong>.
