1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/felicitygreen">felicitygreen</a>] 27-4-2006(185): Refined rice [1535] can only be found in exclusive grocery shops.<strong> Coarse</strong> <em>rice</em> by contrast fills the supermarket <em>shelves</em> - don&#039;t go looking for anything else there.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blaked569">blaked569</a>] 22-3-2009(140): Ugh, why does this <em>shelf</em> feel so<strong> coarse</strong>? Because it&#039;s made of <em>rice</em>, of<strong> coarse</strong>! Get it? Of<strong> coarse</strong>?? Hahahahahahahahahah god i hate my life.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 30-12-2006(37): In America they sell<strong> coarse</strong> rice on the shelves. The Japanese are much more discriminating, as they eat rice all the time, so they want finer rice.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 22-2-2009(20): Japanese carpenters don&#039;t use sandpaper, they use rice-paper(rice glued on to some paper). Here the carpenter is using the<strong> coarse</strong> paper to smooth out the shelf he&#039;s making.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/firion1234">firion1234</a>] 18-3-2010(10): &quot;<em>RICE</em> is not nice,&quot; said the <em>CAT IN THE HAT</em>, &quot;it is much to<strong> COARSE</strong>, like food for a horse.&quot;.
