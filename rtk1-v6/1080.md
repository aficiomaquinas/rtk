1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 18-10-2005(178): &quot;<em>Mister T</em><strong> substitute</strong>s an <em>arrow</em> for a toothpick&quot; -- The keyword meaning is to replace something with something else, to act for another, to represent. It&#039;s best to stick to the first meaning, because the last two are very close to &quot;mediator&quot; which will come in frame 1761. The idea here is that the <em>arrow</em> is not a toothpick, neither it is changed into one, but it can<strong> substitute</strong> for one.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bkvogel">bkvogel</a>] 31-7-2008(60): Mr. T shot the<strong> substitute</strong> teacher with an arrow.

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36">laner36</a>] 9-9-2007(31): The gym teacher asks <em>Mr. T</em> to<strong> substitute</strong> for him on the day the kids will be shooting <em>arrows</em> for archery class. Imagine going home and telling your friends &quot;dude! Mr T was my sub today! I hope my teacher gets hit with an arrowhead and never comes back!&quot;. (thanks dihutenosa).

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 18-9-2006(15): [substitute; change; convert; replace; period; age; counter for decades of ages, eras, etc.; generation; charge; rate; fee] A stuntman is a <em>person</em> working as <strong>substitute</strong> for the main actor in the scene when he is shot by an <em>arrow</em>.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ellen">Ellen</a>] 5-4-2010(7): I immediately thought of<strong> substitute</strong> in a footballing sense, and this video came to mind: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jUzIxnbkpI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jUzIxnbkpI</a>. Imagine Mr. T in Segata Sanshiro&#039;s position and you have Mr. T throwing a<strong> substitute</strong> player like an arrow.
