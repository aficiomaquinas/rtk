    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>The Roman numeral I - like that for II we met earlier in frame 379 - is only rarely used now. In the midst of all the <i>samurai</i>, we notice one in particular <i>sitting on the ground</i> with a <i>crown</i> on his head, indicating that he is &quot;number I&quot; in the current rankings.</p>
