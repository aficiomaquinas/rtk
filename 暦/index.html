    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>Look at this character in reverse order, from bottom up. First we see the primitive for <i>days</i>, an appropriate enough way to begin a <b>calendar</b>. Next we see a <i>grove of trees</i> growing under a <i>cliff</i>. The laws of nature being what they are, the <i>trees</i> would be stunted under such conditions, unless they were strong enough to keep growing upwards until they passed through the layers of rock and soil, right up to the surface. Now imagine that in those little boxes marking off the <i>days</i> on your wall <b>calendar</b>, you see that very process taking place step by step: 365 or so time-lapse pictures of that <i>grove of trees</i> each month, from January under the <i>cliff</i> to December on top of the <i>cliff</i>. The story is not as complex as it sounds, particularly if you happen to have a <b>calendar</b> nearby and can flip through it with this image in mind.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 15-11-2007(241): Years-Months-Days: It takes many years for a <em>cliff</em> to form or erode. A <em>tree</em> takes many months to grow. But <em>days</em> pass by regularly - so in this way, we see the movement of time such as with a<strong> CALENDAR</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 21-9-2006(122): This is just a picture of a wall<strong> calendar</strong> with a page for each month. The bottom half has the grid of days, the top half has a pretty picture of a forest this month. The cliff radical here is the top and left edges of the paper. You can see the paper curling up at the lower left where a breeze is trying to turn the page.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 31-7-2007(68): You can use a<strong> calendar</strong> to count the number of DAYs it takes to grow two TREES under a CLIFF.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura">taikura</a>] 13-1-2009(47): <strong>Calendar; almanac.</strong> A<strong> calendar</strong> measures time in years, months and days. A <em>cliff</em> (厂) takes years to form; a <em>grove</em> ( 木木 ) of trees takes months to grow; but the <em>sun</em> ( 日 ) rises and falls every day. All of these periods can be recorded in a<strong> calendar</strong>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen">Ningen</a>] 1-9-2008(28): I love those nature<strong> CALENDAR</strong>s with all the photos of <em>cliffs</em> and <em>trees</em> and the setting <em>sun</em>.</p>
