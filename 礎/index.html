    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>zoo(zoo) Rather than use this for animals in general, we will refer to it as a zoo, to avoid confusion with the other animals that will be showing up. Except for the downward hook at the end of the first stroke, this element is indistinguishable from mending. Perhaps by now you have developed a quick eye for such details. If not now, you will before long. [5]</p>
	

  	
    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>This character depicts a <b>cornerstone</b> as a <i>stone</i> set at the end of a wildlife preserve (the &quot;<i>zoo</i> in the<i> grove</i>&quot;).</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 24-9-2007(245): Features like <em>stones</em> and <em>groves of trees</em> are the<strong> cornerstone</strong>s of a happy <em>zoo</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu">ihatobu</a>] 9-11-2007(60): A zoo which is still under construction is already full of animals. At the moment, only the<strong> cornerstone</strong> has been set in place. To temporarily keep the animals from escaping, a closely-packed grove of small trees is planted around the stone. (Note that this zoo needs some serious <em>mending</em>.).</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean">cerulean</a>] 4-7-2008(39): <em>Stone Grove Zoo</em> is the new<strong> cornerstone</strong> in animal exhibits! If you love animals you need to check out <em>Stone Grove Zoo!</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jshield1">jshield1</a>] 23-4-2009(29): How am I the only one who doesn't see how mend turned into zoo with one stroke.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus">Codexus</a>] 17-12-2007(15): To make room for the new <em>zoo</em>, they use dynamite sending all the <em>grove's</em> trees flying in the air. That big <em>stone</em> on the left now serves as<strong> cornerstone</strong>. (Variation on ziggr's story, with more emphasis on placement that was giving me trouble).</p>
