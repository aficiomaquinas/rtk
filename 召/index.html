    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>A <i>sword</i> or <i>dagger</i> posed over a <i>mouth</i> is how the character for &quot;beckoning&quot; is written. The related but less tame key word <b>seduce</b> was chosen because it seemed to fit better with the - how shall we put it? - Freudian implications of the kanji. (Observe if you will that it is not sure whether the long slender object is <b>seducing</b> the small round one or vice versa.)</p>
  
  
  	
    <h2>Heisig comment:</h2>
    <p>* The primitive meaning remains the same: <i>seduce</i>. Just be sure to associate it with a very concrete image.</p>
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/arekuru">arekuru</a>] 24-6-2008(172): A man is easily<strong> seduce</strong>d by a mouth to his "sword.".</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cornrow">cornrow</a>] 1-11-2008(94): When you<strong> seduce</strong> a girl you can put your sword in her mouth.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rakutenka">rakutenka</a>] 2-7-2007(87): To<strong> seduce</strong> is to make a <em>sword</em> of one's <em>mouth</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rotifera">rotifera</a>] 11-11-2007(23): To<strong> seduce</strong> is to accomplish with the <em>mouth</em> what cannot (or should not) be done with a <em>sword</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 7-8-2008(17): 召す 【めす】 (v5s,vt) (1) to call; to send for; (2) to put on; to wear; to take (a bath); to ride in; to buy; to eat; to drink; to catch (a cold); (P) This kanji isn't anything sexual or anything. It means SUMMON/TO SEND/CALL FOR (as well as honorific form of eat/drink). STORY: A king is having a hard time EATING a piece of of meat b/c it can't fit in his MOUTH, so he CALLS FOR/SUMMONS someone to bring him his SWORD. (this keeps the eat/drink meaning of the kanji true as well).</p>
