    <h2>Heisig story:</h2>
    <p>To associate the <b>peach tree</b> with the primitive for a <i>portent</i>, recall the famous Japanese legend of Momotarō, the <b>Peach</b> Boy. It begins once upon a time with a fisherman and his wife who wanted badly to have a child, but none was born to them. Then one day the old man caught a giant <b>peach</b>, out of which jumped a healthy young lad whom they named <b>Peach</b> Boy. Though the boy was destined to perform heroic deeds, his birth also <i>portended</i> great misfortune (how else could he become a hero?). Thus the <i>tree</i> that is associated with a <i>portent</i> of coming evil comes to be the <b>peach tree</b>.</p>
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 5-10-2007(92): The pits of a<strong> peach tree</strong> look like <em>turtles</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/JetSetArnett">JetSetArnett</a>] 11-3-2008(80): King Koopa consistently captures Princess Peach. Eventually he's going to run out of castles and just set her in a tree.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 18-12-2007(56): If you gave the meaning "a person's back" to the primitive in <a href="../v4/235.html">portent</a> (#235 兆), you can easily discover that a<strong> peach tree</strong> is the <em>tree</em> with <em>butt</em>-shaped fruits.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jettyke">jettyke</a>] 16-9-2009(47): If you used the story about hairy woman´s legs for portent, then:<strong> PEACH TREE</strong> is the TREE that has HAIRY fruits.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun">sutebun</a>] 11-9-2007(26): It's a little known fact, but when the ninja turtles were young Splinter actually made them follow rigid diet. Those turtles actually ate nothing but peaches. In fact, the turtles even planted a<strong> peach tree</strong> in their hideout not only to decorate the place with a tree, but because they were eating nothing but peaches.</p>
