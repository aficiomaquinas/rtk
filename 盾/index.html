    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>drag Althoughnot a pictograph in the strict sense, this primitive depicts one stroke pulling another along behind it. Note how it differs from cliff and person because of this dragging effect,not to mention the fact that the first stroke is written right to left, almost as if it were a long drop. When this element comes under a different element, the strokes are drawn apart like this: --. [2]</p>

<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 4-9-2007(236): This is a magic<strong> shield</strong> with <em>ten eyes</em> which have the power to <em>drag</em> the victim towards it.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 16-8-2006(52): You paint 10 huge eyes on your<strong> shield</strong> to scare the enemy, but consequently your<strong> shield</strong> is so big and heavy that you have to drag it.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 10-6-2007(45): From Wikipedia: "If a Spartan hoplite were to return to Sparta alive and without his<strong> shield</strong>, it was assumed that he threw his<strong> shield</strong> at the enemy in an effort to flee; an act punishable by death or banishment." Picture the enemy of a Spartan soldier poking his <em>eyes</em> out with a <em>sewing needle</em> and trying to steal his<strong> shield</strong>. However, the Spartan desperately clutches on, and is <em>dragged around</em> for a while, preferring to die than to lose his<strong> shield</strong>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 5-7-2008(12): TEN EYES = BEHOLDER. You use your<strong> SHIELD</strong> to block the BEHOLDERS rays and bounce them back on him. You DRAG his head home victorious.　.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Renaissance">Renaissance</a>] 12-3-2010(8): Girls are being taught that if someone tries to drag them away, they should poke the harasser's eyes out with a needle. This type of precaution is well known, so harassers nowadays prepare themselves by carrying eyeshields, in order to deflect the needles.</p>
