<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue">notgoing2argue</a>] 31-8-2007(311): Spiderman buys a <em>locket</em> for Mary Jane because he wants to get<strong> HORIZONTAL</strong> with her.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 31-5-2007(54): Spiderman on a boat, marking the Earth's <strong>latitudes</strong>. He first attaches a personal locket to a small piece of thread for ballast and good luck, and shoots with his right hand. After a few minutes (and lots and lots of thread), the <em>locket and thread</em> have flown around the world. Spiderman catches the locket with his left hand, and ties the thread's ends together. Voilà.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 21-1-2006(27): Hint : this kanji also means "latitude", which are the<strong> horizontal</strong> lines on a globe. Do you remember James Heisig's story for frame 175 "black ink" ? Here a cartographer on a ship, is using his "<em>thread locket</em>" to mark<strong> horizontal</strong> lines on a map. He pulls a chalked thread from the locket, and snaps it to mark<strong> horizontal</strong> lines. Imagine the "thread-locket" in the shape of a globe, filled with dark powder and a little bobbin of thread.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scotty28">scotty28</a>] 14-12-2009(17): Spiderman gave up being spiderman and promised Mary Jane to live the<strong> horizontal</strong> life like the rest of us. Whenever he starts to feel like he wants to go back to his spidy ways, he takes out his locket with a mary jane picture to remind him that he will forever live<strong> horizontal</strong>y.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw">lifeflaw</a>] 26-3-2009(13): Imagine yourself tie a <em>locket</em> to the end of a <em>thread</em> and spin it<strong> horizontal</strong>ly..</p>
