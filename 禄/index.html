<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 24-1-2007(25): Ancient Japanese officials collected their<strong> salarium</strong> in the shrines. A priest would collect their <em>rice grains</em> with a <em>broom</em>, and sweep it unto the <em>altar</em>, where the officials could collect their rice.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 20-2-2008(11): Rather than cold hard cash, the <em>rice</em> that the <em>altar</em> boys could <em>sweep</em> up became their<strong> salarium</strong>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 21-2-2010(5): Since rice was a form of currency back then, <em>altar</em> boys in the Catholic Church used to <em>sweep up</em> and collect the <em>rice grains</em> after a wedding, and considered it their<strong> salarium</strong> in exchange for their underage sex services.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 22-5-2009(4): The<strong> salarium</strong> for the Japanes army is not money. They are paid with <em>videotapes</em> (录, see record <a href="../v4/1144.html">record</a> (#1144 録). The higher the rank, the longer and dirtier the film :-).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shonb6570">Shonb6570</a>] 12-5-2011(2): This word is obsolete - It comes from the Roman era when soldiers were paid with salt, or rather, "salarium argentum", which means something like "salt money". Incoincidentally, it is where the term, "Worth your salt" comes from. Heisig's word choice for some of these is asinine. The Kanji means "salary" or "stipend".</p>
